Comments 

Audi has announced that the 'defeat' devices fitted in some Volkswagen cars to cheat government emissions tests was also used in 2.1 million of its own cars. 

Some 1.42 million Audi vehicles with so-called EU5 engines in Western Europe are fitted with the same software that allowed parent company Volkswagen to cheat US emissions tests, with 577,000 in Germany and almost 13,000 in the United States, a spokesman for Ingolstadt-based Audi told Reuters today. 

Affected model lines include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5, the spokesman said. 

Volkswagen shares have fallen more than 5pc in late morning trade. 

It has also emerged that Volkswagen has suspended the R&D chiefs of its core VW brand, luxury division Audi and sports-car maker Porsche, sources familiar with the matter told reporters. 

The carmaker's supervisory board last Friday agreed to put a number of employees on leave until the details of VW's emissions cheating scandal were cleared up, without providing names. 

Meanwhile, European environmental organisation, Transport & Environment, has said it has found some new models of Mercedes, Volkswagens, BMWs and other new cars consume much more petrol than lab tests claim, according to reports from PA. 

The organisation said it had found no proof the cars are equipped with the same sort of ""defeat devices"" installed on diesel-powered Volkswagens, but called on European Union governments to broaden their probes into the scandal to cover petrol cars as well.. VW's 'clean diesel' strategy unraveled by outside emissions tests. By Paul Lienert and Timothy Gardner

DETROIT\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) commissioned researchers at West Virginia University to test diesel car emissions in 2013, the group expected to find that diesel cars sold in the U.S. emitted fewer pollutants than cars sold elsewhere because they had to meet tougher standards, ICCT officials told Reuters on Monday.

Instead, after testing a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta and a 2013 VW Passat, researchers were ""surprised"" when the results showed the opposite: the two VW models displayed much higher levels of nitrogen oxide emissions than permitted by law, while a third test vehicle, a BMW X5, generally fell within permissible limits. 

""Our hypothesis was these cars would all come out clean,"" said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the ICCT, a non-profit independent research group with offices in Washington, San Francisco and Berlin.

In May 2014, ICCT alerted the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board about their findings. On Friday, EPA said VW could be liable for up to $18 billion in penalties for using software on almost 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars that circumvented emissions regulations, unleashing a controversy that threatens long-term damage to VW's finances, leadership and reputation.

VW shares in Europe fell almost 20 percent on Monday, and the company suspended U.S. sales of its diesel cars until it can come up with a fix to satisfy regulators. The disclosure comes as VW's U.S. sales have lagged the company's performance in other global markets, and could hamper its efforts to boost demand in the American market.

Industry experts said the scandal could hit VW hard, just as it was emerging from a damaging leadership battle. VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said on Sunday he was ""deeply sorry"" for the breach of U.S. rules and ordered an investigation. People including a VW supervisory board member said Winterkorn may have to resign. 

The concerns raised by ICCT ""prompted CARB to start an investigation and discussions"" with VW in 2014, CARB said. Nitrogen oxide emissions have been linked to smog and acid rain.

VW agreed to conduct its own tests to replicate the ICCT study, proposed a software fix to CARB.

'CLEAN DIESEL'

VW has been airing TV commercials lauding its ""clean diesel"" cars for several years, including ads that ran last November, even as the company was aware of the emissions controversy. VW on Monday said there was no intention to misinform the public with its clean diesel ads.

In December, VW issued a voluntary recall of all its U.S. diesel cars from model years 2009-2014.

The recall didn't end the matter. CARB, in cooperation with EPA, said it wanted to do ""confirmatory"" tests, and it ran those beginning in May 2015. In July, CARB notified VW that the test vehicles still showed emissions that exceeded state and federal limits. California shared those results with federal regulators. 

VW attributed the excess emissions to ""various technical issues"" and ""unexpected"" real-world conditions. 

It wasn't until EPA and CARB threatened to withhold certification for the automaker's 2016 diesel models that VW in early September revised its explanation.

""Only then did VW admit it had designed and installed a defeat device in these vehicles in the form of a sophisticated software algorithm that detected when a vehicle was undergoing emissions testing,"" the EPA said in its September 18 letter to VW.

The EPA on Friday said that it ""intends to compel VW to issue a recall"" once the automaker has developed a satisfactory fix. But as of mid-day Monday, company and EPA officials said there was no recall.

VW executives were scheduled to unveil the 2016 Passat - including a ""clean diesel"" version - in New York City on Monday evening. The company late Monday said the 2016 Passat diesel has not yet been certified for the U.S. by the EPA.

The probe will be expanded to all German diesel cars if issues are found. 
 
VW shares plunged nearly 20% on Monday after US regulators found that some VW cars could manipulate emissions tests. 
 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that software in several diesel cars could deceive regulators. 
 
Volkswagen was ordered to recall half a million cars in the US on Friday. 
 
In addition to paying for the recall, VW faces fines that could add up to billions of dollars. There may also be criminal charges for VW executives. 
 
The White House in Washington also reportedly said it was “quite concerned” about VW’s conduct. 
 
“It’s clearly putting German industry under a very bad light,” former VW employee Arndt Ellinghorst, now head of global automotive research at Evercore ISI told BBC News. 
 
“This is just something that global consumers are not expecting from a German company, especially an automotive company who by the way is the biggest company in Europe.” 
 
Chief apologises 
 
Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn apologised after the scandal emerged and said he would “support” the German transport ministry’s investigation into the carmaker. 
 
“I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,” Mr. Winterkorn said. 
 
He has launched an investigation into the software that allowed VW cars to emit less during tests than they would while driving normally. 
 
The EPA found the “defeat device”, the device that allowed VW cars to emit less during tests than they would while driving normally, in diesel cars including the Audi A3 and the VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. 
 
VW has stopped selling the relevant diesel models in the US, where diesel cars account for about a quarter of sales. 
 
The EPA said that the fine for each vehicle that did not comply with federal clean air rules would be up to $37,500 (£24,000). With 482,000 cars sold since 2008 involved in the allegations, it means the fines could reach $18bn. 
 
That would be a considerable amount, even for the company that recently overtook Toyota to be the world’s top-selling vehicle maker in the first six months of the year. Its stock market value is about €66bn ($75bn; £48bn). 
 
Investigation 
 
VW has ordered an external investigation, although it has not revealed who will be conducting it. 
 
“We do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law,” Mr Winterkorn said. 
 
Arndt Ellinghorst explained why it is so difficult to sell diesel cars in the US: “Carmakers have to comply with 31mg NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions per kilometre – in Europe that’s 80mg, so it’s much easier to comply in Europe when you’re selling a diesel vehicle compared to the US.” 
 
“It makes cars far more expensive because carmakers have to add more technology.” 
 
BBC. The Latest: 2.1 million Audi vehicles have suspect software. BERLIN — The latest developments on the Volkswagen emissions scandal. All times local. 

___ 

A European environmental organization says it has found some new models of Mercedes, Volkswagens, BMWs and other new cars consume much more gasoline than lab tests claim. 

The organization, Transport & Environment, said Monday it had found no proof the cars are equipped with the same sort of ""defeat devices"" installed on diesel-powered Volkswagens to enable them to cheat on emissions tests. 

But the group called on European Union governments to broaden their probes into the ""defeat devices"" to cover gasoline cars as well. 

Transport & Environment said according to its research, the gap between lab test results for fuel economy and real-world performance rose last year to 40 percent on average, from 8 percent in 2001. 

It said the difference for Mercedes A, C and E class models is over 50 percent.. VW diesel scandal spreads to Audi, Porsche — and possibly even BMW. Share This article  
Fallout from the Volkswagen diesel scandal continues to grow, as this morning brings reports that Audi’s head of research and development Ulrich Hackenberg and Porsche’s engine chief Wolfgang Hatz are both out — two of the top engineering figures in the Volkswagen’s other flagship brands. That comes as a bit of a surprise, even though it’s widely expected more heads will roll at VW aside from Martin Winterkorn, the CEO of the company’s US operations, who resigned effective yesterday. 

Meanwhile, there’s word from the German newspaper Auto Bild that BMW’s diesel engines were also “significantly” exceeding regulatory limits, CNBC reports , with the BMW X3 2.0-liter diesel model spitting out 11 times more nitrogen oxide than the current level set by the European Union. 

“[We did not] manipulate or rig any emissions tests. We observe the legal requirements in each country and adheres to all local testing requirements,” BMW said in a statement in response to the allegations. “When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (e.g. test bench situation) or on the road…We are not familiar with the test mentioned by Auto Bild concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 during a road test. No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results.” 



Late last week, news of the diesel scandal broke as VW admitted to cheating on emissions tests with the use of a software-based defeat device on almost 500,000 of its 2.0-liter “clean diesel” TDI engines sold in versions of the Jetta, Jetta SportWagen, Golf, new Golf SportWagen, Passat, and Beetle, as well as the Audi A3, since the 2009 model year. The scandal encompasses both the 140-horsepower, 236 lb-ft-of-torque blocks and the newer 150-hp engines released beginning with 2015 models. Later VW admitted that the software is actually installed on over 11 million vehicles globally. 

While diesel engine sales account for less than one percent of the passenger car market in the US, it had been growing, and it composes much more of the European car market thanks to higher fuel prices, looser emissions standards, and widespread fudging — reports abound of car manufacturers taping the doors shut and folding in mirrors to improve aerodynamics during tests, for example. It’s already known that VW has cheated in both the US and Europe. But the fact that its other brands may be exposed in the same manner, and that other auto manufacturers like BMW may also be involved, improve the odds that diesel may soon be dead in cars in the US once more.. South Korea to probe VW, Audi diesel car emissions. The scandal engulfing Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), which has admitted cheating diesel vehicle emissions tests in the United States, spread east on Tuesday as South Korea said it would investigate three of the maker's diesel…  
SEOUL\/NEW YORK: The scandal engulfing Volkswagen AG, which has admitted cheating diesel vehicle emissions tests in the United States, spread east on Tuesday as South Korea said it would investigate three of the maker's diesel models. 

Volkswagen shares plunged by 19 percent on Monday after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on 

Friday that the world's biggest carmaker by sales used software that deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions and could face penalties of up to $18 billion. 

Media reports say the U.S. Department of Justice has started a criminal probe into the allegations, which cover several VW and Audi-branded diesel models including the Audi A3, VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat. 

The South Korean probe will involve 4,000 to 5,000 Jetta, Golf and Audi A3 vehicles produced in 2014 and 2015, Park Pan-kyu, a deputy director at South Korea's environment ministry, told Reuters. 

The ministry will consider recalling those vehicles after conducting the investigation, he said. 

""If South Korean authorities find problems in the VW diesel cars, the probe could be expanded to all German diesel cars,"" he said. 

Volkswagen Korea declined to comment. 

German rivals Daimler and BMW have said the accusations against VW did not apply to them. 

The European Commission has said it is in contact with VW and U.S. regulators, but it was too early to say whether VW vehicles in Europe were also affected. 

A VW spokesman in Australia said the company had contacted its head office in Germany asking for advice about how to proceed and whether it expected cars sold in Australia to be affected. He added that the Australian office had not been contacted by local police or government agencies. 

""Screwed up"" 

Overnight, VW's U.S. head Michael Horn, who was attending a lavish event in New York to promote the 2016 VW Passat, admitted the company had ""totally screwed up"" and vowed to make amends. 

Horn's presentation did not promote the environmental efficiency of the Passat's ""clean diesel"" model, focusing instead on the vehicle's new sensor technology to assist with parking and avoiding accidents. 

It is unclear what will be the ultimate cost of the scandal to VW, which also faces a class-action lawsuit from buyers, but sales of affected versions of the relevant models have already been suspended in the United States and Canada. 

""I had to back out of a couple deals the same day,"" said a dealer attending Horn's event in New York. ""That hurt me because we found out in…. Former VW boss faces probe over emissions scandal. The Africa News.Net  Monday 28th September, 2015  
  BERLIN - German prosecutors are investigating former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn for possible fraud related to selling cars with falsified emissions data even as the world's biggest automaker suspended three top engineers. 
Prosecutors in the German state of Lower Saxony said they have launched a criminal investigation into Winterkorn. 
 
The company, which overtook Toyota in the first half of the year as the biggest car maker by sales, is in crisis over its rigging of diesel engine emissions tests in America and Europe. 
 
The company says 11 million of its cars around the world could be affected 
 
The company also suspended three top engineers, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as VW tries to get to grips with a crisis that has knocked more than a third off its market value and could harm Germany's economy. 
 
Winterkorn resigned last week owning responsibility for the scandal, but he has said he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. 
 
The probe into Winterkorn will look at ""allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data"", the prosecutor's office said. 
 
On Friday, the company appointed Matthias Mueller, the head of Porsche, to succeed Winterkorn. 
 
Volkswagen's luxury brand, Audi, said on Monday that 2.1 million of its cars globally have been affected by the emissions scandal. 
 
Around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe were fitted with the software that allowed Volkswagen to cheat US emissions tests, while 13,000 Audi cars in the US and 577,000 in Germany were also impacted, Audi said. The affected lines include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5, the spokesman said. 
 
Also on Monday, VW's Czech division, Skoda, announced that 1.2 million of its cars were affected by the diesel engine manipulations. 
 
German media meanwhile reported that a Volkswagen engineer had warned the firm about cheating over emission testing back in 2011. 
 
VW, whose subsidiaries also include Porsche and koda, said last week that about 11 million of its cars worldwide were affected by the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
The announcement follows reports on Monday that VW has suspended the research and development chiefs at its VW, Audi and Porsche units. 
 
VW's supervisory board agreed on Friday to put several employees on leave until the details of the emissions scandal were cleared up. No names were provided. 
 
Audi, VW and Porsche declined to comment. VW shares were down more than 5 percent at euro 101.7 (74.8p) in Frankfurt on Monday. 
 
The scandal has become an embarrassment for Germany, which has for years held up Volkswagen as a model of its engineering prowess and has lobbied against some tighter regulations on automakers. 
 
The German car industry employs more than 750,000 people and is a major source of export income. 
 
""The car industry is crucial for the German economy. It (the 
 
scandal) can have a big impact on the German economy,"" Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn told a conference.

( NEWSER ) – The dust was just starting to settle on  Volkswagen's emissions-cheating software  on its US diesel vehicles, but new revelations show the hubbub spreading to Audi. The company's luxury brand reported Monday that 2.1 million of its vehicles—including 13,000 in the US—had the same cheat software, reports  CNBC . 
 
Volkswagen's supervisory board handed down suspensions Friday for the R&D heads of its VW, Audi, and Porsche brands until it can figure out who played what role in the deceit, reports  Reuters . Meanwhile, German prosecutors have started investigating  ex-Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn , opening a criminal probe to find out who's to blame and checking for outright fraud, the AP reports—an even more possible scenario as German media reported Monday that a company engineer made cheating allegations back in 2011, CNBC notes.

VW CEO under pressure as stock crashes. Shares in German auto giant Volkswagen (VW) fell more than 20 percent in morning trading at the Frankfurt stock exchange on Monday in reaction to revelations that some of its diesel cars in the United States had been fitted with software that gave false emissions data. 
 
In a statement on Sunday, the carmaker had said that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) had ""detected manipulations that violate American environmental standards"" while testing VW diesel cars. 
 
Chief executive Martin Winterkorn issued an apology and said he had ordered an external investigation into the matter. ""The board of management takes these findings very seriously. I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,"" Winterkorn said. 
 
 Sales stop 
 
Meanwhile, the Volkswagen Group has ordered its dealers in the United States to halt all sales of the latest diesel models of its Volkswagen and Audi brands. 
 
The EPA said on Friday the software in these models deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions. Cynthia Giles, an enforcement officer at the EPA, said the cars in question ""contained software that turns off emissions controls when driving normally and turns them on when the car is undergoing an emissions test"". 
 
On the road, the cars were emitting as much as 40 times the level of pollutants allowed under clean air rules, Giles added. 
 
Volkswagen could face civil penalties of $37,500 (33,100 euros) for each vehicle not in compliance with federal clean air rules. Some 482,000 four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars sold since 2008 are involved in the allegations. 
 
If each car involved is found to be in noncompliance, the penalty could amount to $18 billion, an EPA official confirmed during a telephone conference on Friday. 
 
VW CEO Martin Winterkorn said the German carmaker would fully cooperate with US regulators, and added that the company would ""not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules of law."" 
 
 Calls for the CEO to resign 
 
According to Ferdinand Dudenhöfer, automobile expert with Germany's Duisburg-Essen University, the chief executive is part of VW's problem and not the solution. He assumes Winterkorn must have known about the manipulations. 
 
""This component has received official clearance for all markets from the VW Development Department. The head of this department is Martin Winterkorn,"" Dudenhöfer told DW. 
 
""VW's board of directors needs to go on the offensive during a meeting scheduled for Friday to stem the fallout of the scandal. But this can only be achieved without CEO Winterkorn, I believe,"" he added. 
 
Bärbel Höhn, the head of the German parliament's environment commission, also said she thinks the deceptive software device couldn't have been installed without the CEO's approval. 
 
Höhn, a member of the environmentalist Greens Party, added she wouldn't be surprised if other carmakers are also found to have resorted to manipulations to meet tightened emissions standards in the United States and Europe.

Volkswagen's emissions crisis has deepened with Audi and Skoda adding 3.3 million vehicles to the 11 million VWs already affected by the pollution scandal. 

Audi says 2.1 million models around the world are fitted with software intended to deceive strict emissions tests in the US, while a further 1.2 million Skoda vehicles have the same issue. 
Audi's A4 sedan looks to have been caught up in the crisis.  Photo: Supplied  
Cars fitted with some diesel engines produced by the company were equipped with a secret engine management mode that allowed cars to meet emissions standards during government testing, before returning to a normal mode that emits much more pollution during regular driving. 

Audi says the issue does not affect petrol or V6 and V8 diesel models.  

Four-cylinder diesel models certified to the latest Euro6 emissions standard are also ok, but 1.6 TDI and 2.0TDI four-cylinder diesel models built to the earlier Euro5 standard are under a cloud. 
Audi has invested heavily in diesel technology, using it on the road and track.  Photo: Supplied  
The Volkswagen group's luxury arm says several models including the Audi A1 and A3 hatchbacks, A4 and A6 sedans, A5 and TT coupes and Q3 and Q5 SUVs may be affected by the overseas development. 

Those cars are all available in Australia, though Audi has not revealed whether any local models are affected. Similarly, Volkswagen Australia cannot yet say whether local cars are caught up in the scandal. 

Volkswagen's management says it will pursue and punish staff responsible for the issue. 
 
Its former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, is at the centre of a German police investigation looking into whether his company defrauded European motorists and the government. 

Winterkorn left the company on Wednesday claiming he had no knowledge that manipulation of emissions figures had taken place. 

- with wire services. The new, seventh-generation Audi A6 sedan makes its bow. AUDI Malaysia unveiled its seventh-generation Audi A6 in Kuala Lumpur last Tuesday, and the sedan — available with either an efficient 1.8 TFSI engine or a sporty 3.0 TFSI engine with quattro — comes jam-packed with notable updates, both inside and out. 
 

 
“The Audi A6 is one of our most successful vehicles and the lynchpin of our product range, making it a symbol of Audi’s leadership in the premium segment,”said Audi Malaysia managing director Immo Buschmann at the launch.  
 
“With a newer lightweight aluminium composite construction, a sporty and dynamic chassis, powerful yet even more efficient engines and the latest multimedia systems, the new Audi A6 rewrites the business-class standards, placing this distinguished sedan firmly as the leading character in this competitive segment.” 
 
Originally known as the Audi 100, the Audi A6 was first introduced in 1968, providing the foundation for Audi’s premium positioning as the flagship for the brand at the time. Since its inception, the seven generations of the Audi 100 and its successor, the Audi A6 (since midway in the fourth generation), have always showcased the brand’s innovative technologies and progressive approach in what has quickly become the most competitive segment — the business class. 
 
Elegant and powerful, the new Audi A6 showcases balanced proportions, sharp lines, emphasised horizontals and athletically taut surfaces. Carefully honed as part of the model refresh, its signature Singleframe grille now appears even wider, with chrome struts providing a greater level of elegance and undeniable presence.  
 
Elsewhere on the updated Audi A6, changes have also been made to the air inlets, bumpers, side sills, rear lights, tailpipes and headlights, making for an enhanced aesthetic that is at once familiar yet worthy of a double take.  
 
A feature of Audi’s progressive design, the headlights of the new sedan have seen particularly significant updates. Besides featuring newly designed light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lights, the xenon plus units on the entry-level model and LED headlights on the higher-spec variant can now both be upgraded with Audi’s Matrix LED technology combined with dynamic indicators.  
 
The brand’s proprietary Matrix LED technology makes use of an array of 19 LEDs per headlight paired with four reflectors to produce a high-beam light that illuminates the road far ahead while not blinding other road users. 
 
The improvements on the new Audi A6 go more than skin-deep. Incorporating numerous components of aluminium and hot-shaped steel that form the backbone of a systematic lightweight construction concept, this updated sedan offers a curb weight (without driver) of just 1,535kg, while providing improved insulation from vibrations and lower cabin noise than ever before. The improved intelligent composite construction concept ensures greater rigidity of the car’s body, which in turn results in higher safety at all times. 
 

 
The updated Audi A6 now comes with two optimised engine options that offer more power and refinement. The entry-level variant now features a new 1.8 TFSI engine mated with Audi’s very own seven-speed S tronic  transmission that delivers 190 horsepower (hp) and 320 newton metre (nm) of torque. Despite its unassuming engine capacity, this business sedan is now able to sprint from 0 to 100kph in just 7.9 seconds (a full 0.4 seconds faster than its two-litre engine predecessor) with a top speed of 233kph, whilst maintaining fuel efficiency with a combined cycle of just 5.7 litres\/100km and a CO2 emission rating of 133g\/km.  
 
The updated flagship of the A6 range in Malaysia sees an improved supercharged 3.0 TFSI V6 engine paired once again with a seven-speed S tronic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive. This dynamic combination allows the new Audi A6 3.0 to develop 333hp and a maximum torque of 440nm between 2,900 and 5,300 revolutions per minute, enabling it to make the century sprint in 5.1 seconds, continuing all the way to an electronically governed top speed of 250kph. Despite its exhilarating performance, the A6 3.0 TFSI quattro® is still highly fuel-efficient, with a combined fuel consumption rating of 7.4 litres\/100km and a CO2 emission of just 172g\/km. 
 
Like all current Audi models, the new Audi A6 also comes equipped with a smorgasbord of electronic features to ensure an efficient and safe driving experience, including a start\/stop system with energy recuperation, electronic stabilisation control, traction control, electronic brake force distribution, electronic differential lock, parking aid plus with selective display, anti-lock braking system and a total of six airbags for the updated Audi A6 1.8 TFSI (eight for the A6 3.0 TFSI).

Frankfurt show: Audi turbocharges S4. AUDI has unveiled its new-generation S4 sedan and Avant wagon at the Frankfurt motor show, with the high-performance duo scaling new heights via a 260kW 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 under the bonnet.

To be released in Australia in the final quarter of next year, several months after the regular A4 range switches to the new B9 series, the S4 is expected to remain a single model variant across both body styles, combining comprehensive forced-induction engine power with an automatic gearbox and quattro all-wheel drive.

However, the current supercharged direct-injection 3.0-litre V6 – good for 245kW of power and 440Nm of torque – makes way for a lighter, more efficient and significantly more powerful TFSI turbocharged unit that produces 260kW and 500Nm, the latter available from 1300-4500rpm.

Driving through a new, more conventional eight-speed Tiptronic transmission rather than the current seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch gearbox, the redesigned S4 sedan can accelerate from 0-100km\/h in 4.7 seconds, on its way to an electronically limited 250km\/h top speed.

The current S4 sedan reaches 100km\/h from standstill in a claimed 5.0 seconds (and the same top speed), while returning combined-cycle fuel economy of 8.1 litres per 100 kilometres and emitting 190 grams per kilometre of CO2.

The new S4 lowers consumption to 7.4L\/100km and takes CO2 emissions down to 170g\/km, with Audi pointing to the new transmission as a key contributing factor, particularly with it switching to freewheeling to save on fuel ""whenever the driving situation allows"".

The overall vehicle is considerably lighter, too, tipping the scales at 1630kg in sedan form, or 1675kg with the Avant. The current S4 sedan has an unladen weight of 1705kg (Avant: 1750kg). 

During normal driving, the quattro permanent all-wheel-drive system operates (via the self-locking differential) with a 40:60 front\/rear engine torque split, with scope for up to 70 per cent to be distributed to the front axle and 85 per cent to the rear. 

As before, an electronically controlled locking rear differential will be available as an option to improve the handling further.

The S4 benefits from the regular A4's broad technical improvements in areas such as body, chassis, suspension, aerodynamics and the like. 

This includes the use of a five-link suspension front and rear and lightweight electro-mechanical power steering, with variable speed-dependent dynamic steering optionally available. 

The standard S sport suspension is 23mm lower than the regular A4. Active damper control is available as an option, although Audi's 'drive select' system is fitted standard, enabling the driver to adjust the suspension characteristics across a variety of modes.

High-performance braking hardware is also par for the course, along with standard 18-inch wheels in a five twin-spoke star design and 245\/40-section tyres. A 19-inch alternative has also been developed. 

In the styling department, Audi continues with its self-confessed ""subtly understated"" look for the high-performance sedan and wagon, preferring to focus on S-specific body adornments and ""targeted aerodynamics"" in areas such as the front airdam and tailgate design. 

The dark-themed cabin also has a plethora of sporting details and, again, all the improvements brought with the new-generation A4 in areas such as passenger accommodation and technical innovation. 

The S sports seats are covered in a combination of pearl Nappa leather and Alcantara in the colours ebony, rotor grey and magma red, and come with adjustable bolsters and a pneumatic massage function.

The 'virtual cockpit' with its fully digital instrument cluster and hi-res 12.3-inch screen includes an S4-specific Sport screen. 

As an upper-echelon member of the A4 range, a high level of standard equipment is fitted to the S4 models, including the latest MMI multimedia system, advanced driver assistance systems (active lane assist, adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition, park assist, Audi pre-sense, and so on), LED lights front and rear and, for the Avant, an electronically controlled tailgate and luggage compartment cover.

Optional equipment includes Matrix LED headlights, a head-up display, and sensor control for the tailgate on the Avant.

Final Australian specification and pricing is still to be announced. The current S4 sedan is priced from $104,610 plus on-road costs, while the Avant starts at $108,11.

Addressing the Assembly, Obama said military power alone was not enough to resolve the situation in Syria and stamp out IS. He said he was prepared to work with Iran and Russia, both staunch backers of Assad, to resolve the conflict in Syria. Obama said: ""The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. ""But we must recognize that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo.""

Four friends killed in crash celebrating 16th birthday High pressure sets up a fine week across the UK. VW warned not to cheat on diesel emissions in 2007, suppressed internal 2011 whistleblower. Share This article  
As VW’s chain of lies about the emissions of its cars  continues to unspool , investigators are moving to discover exactly when VW’s various executives and departments knew it had a problem, and what actions they took (or failed to take) to address it. Such findings could be critical to assessing penalties and fines from various regulatory agencies; If the cover-ups happened at the engineering level, that’s one thing. If senior management actively participated in hiding results from regulators, that’s another. 

Unfortunately for VW shareholders, it appears that multiple companies knew VW was cheating, yet took no action to prevent. A letter from electronics manufacturer Bosch to VW in 2007 warned the company not to use its testing mode for vehicles it intended to sell, noting that the “test mode” changes were meant for VW’s internal testing only. That means VW was implementing these safeguards, or at least considering how to implement them, at least two years before it introduced its then-next-generation TDI diesel vehicles in 2009. The fact that Bosch, a supplier, was aware of VW’s plans and cautioned the company against them is fairly good evidence that the problem was widespread, not limited to a handful of key individuals. 

Perhaps more damaging are the reports that VW actively buried whistleblower reports back in 2011. An internal audit showed problems with VW’s diesel engines back in 2011, but by all accounts nothing was done to resolve the problems. This early news is courtesy of a new fraud investigation launched by German authorities into former CEO Martin Winterkorn’s role in the scandal. Since the news broke, VW has suspended Heinz-Jakob Neusser, head of VW brand development, Ulrich Hackenberg, who oversees R&D at Audi, and Wolfgang Hatz, who handles R&D for Porsche. VW has always had a reputation for centralized development and governance, and the fact that the suspensions have already spread to related car brands could be read as tacit proof that there’s still a day of reckoning coming for the German automaker. 

VW hasn’t just been shuffling corporate officers, however — it’s also launching a website to provide US owners with additional information about any recalls, remedies, or issues specific to particular vehicles. There’s not much on the site right now, except for a video from the CEO and a letter detailing the current state of the situation, but VW states “Volkswagen is committed to finding a remedy as soon as possible.” That’s borderline hilarious, considering we now know the company perpetrated this scheme for as long as eight years — “as soon as possible” didn’t actually involve complying with the law until the company got caught. 
Could this scandal bring down more than just VW? 
So far, there’s been conflicting reports on whether or not other autos from other companies are implicated in VW’s massive cheating. CAFEE, the same organization that tested VW vehicles in real-world conditions, and reported those results to the EPA, found no evidence that the third car it tested , a BMW, had broken emission standards in anything like the same fashion as BMW. According to the UK-based Transport & Environment, independent testing shows that multiple diesel vehicles sold in the EU use up to 50% more fuel then they claim in laboratory tests . The graph below measures excess CO2 emissions, but CO2 emissions are a significant component of measuring fuel economy. This has become an increasing problem in the EU in recent years; the gap between real-world measurements and lab results was just 8% early last decade but certain cars have breached 50% in recent years. 

Small gaps, like the Renault or Toyota, can be explained by differences in lab testing conditions vs. the real-world. Huge gaps can’t be. 

Even if it proves true that Audi, BMW, Mercedes, VMW, and Toyota lied about their vehicle testing in the EU, it doesn’t automatically follow that they cheated US buyers. The European Union and the US don’t just have different emission standards, they have different test conditions. The fact that VW could program the ECU inside the car to disable parts of the emission control system is evidence that modern depend heavily on software to set their running parameters — this isn’t just a hardware problem. That said, a company willing to break the law of its home market is also more likely to break laws in other countries if it believes it can get away with it. 

If it’s proven that automakers in other EU countries broke emissions standards, it could kill the use of diesel across Europe and America as well. If the scandal runs deep enough, fixing the problem on aftermarket vehicles could crush revenues at the various automakers and leave buyers substantially less happy with their vehicles. Whether or not light-duty diesel vehicles can recover from that kind of blow would be very much open to debate. In the US, future VW vehicles will have to meet much more stringent testing standards.. Audi, Porsche R&D chiefs, Volkswagen U.S. CEO to quit: source. BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen will dismiss the R&D chiefs of Audi and Porsche and its top manager in the United States where the carmaker has been found manipulating diesel emission rules, a senior source said on Thursday.

Audi R&D boss Ulrich Hackenberg, Porsche's Wolfgang Hatz and VW's U.S. chief executive Michael Horn will be dismissed at a meeting of the supervisory board on Friday, the source said.

Germany's Bild newspaper earlier on Thursday reported the dismissals of Hackenberg and Hatz.

VW, Audi and Porsche all declined comment.

(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Alexander Ratz and Kirsti Knolle). VW and Audi Returning Green Car Of The Year® Awards, Vehicles Deemed Ineligible. SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., Sept. 30, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- is rescinding the Green Car of the Year® awards previously honoring the 2009 VW Jetta TDI and 2010 Audi A3 TDI, the first time this has occurred in the award program's decade-long history. Audi of America President Scott Keogh has informed Green Car Journal that Audi will return its 2010 Green Car of the Year® award in the wake of Volkswagen Group's admission that it deliberately deceived government authorities about emissions from the Audi A3 TDI. Volkswagen of America has also informed Green Car Journal it will return its 2009 Green Car of the Year® award for the VW Jetta TDI. 

""Rescinding the Green Car of the Year® awards for the VW Jetta TDI and Audi A3 TDI is unfortunate but appropriate,"" said Ron Cogan, editor and publisher of the Green Car Journal and CarsOfChange.com. ""These models were selected as Green Car of the Year® above others for compelling reasons, including high fuel efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, a fun-to-drive nature, and the ability to meet 50 state emissions requirements with advanced diesel technology."" 

However, VW Group has now admitted that its software programming intentionally caused in-lab emissions testing to read significantly lower nitrogen oxide emissions than these vehicles actually produced on the road. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board emissions certifications used in the process of determining award eligibility were thus incorrect, and have since been declared invalid by these government agencies. This means both models would have been ineligible to be finalists in their respective award years. 

In returning its award, Audi's Keogh added that, ""Audi has won hundreds of races and thousands of awards throughout its history. But we only want to win fair and square. Therefore, in light of recent developments, we believe the only right thing to do is to return this important recognition of environmental stewardship. We are determined to compete – and hopefully win – Green Car of the Year® awards the proper way in future years."" 

The annual Green Car of the Year® award recognizes new vehicle models that best raise the bar in environmental performance. Efficiency, emissions, and overall environmental improvement are considered along with market significance, value, and widespread availability to consumers.

SOURCE Green Car Journal. 2016 Audi SQ5 TDI plus.   The already formidable Audi SQ5 TDI reinforces its status as a practical SUV delivering genuine sportscar pace this week as it becomes the latest Audi ‘S’ model to undergo the performance-intensifying 'plus' treatment. With more power, more torque and more equipment than its ‘standard’ counterpart, which is notable as the first ever diesel-powered Audi S model and remains in the line-up, the new SQ5 TDI plus will be available to order later this year. UK pricing will be also be confirmed at a later date. The biturbo V6 TDI at the heart of the SQ5 TDI plus produces 340 PS from its three litres of displacement by way of increased injection pressure. This results in 27 PS more power compared to the current SQ5 TDI. Its peak torque is increased by 50 Nm (36.9 lb-ft) to 700 Nm (516.3 lb-ft), enabling acceleration from rest to 62 mph in a mere 5.1 seconds; top speed is electronically limited at 155 mph. According to the NEDC combined cycle consumption test, up to 42.8mpg is also potentially achievable with emissions of 174 g CO2\/km, which along with the plentiful torque serves as just about the only reminder that this performance flagship prefers diesel. Like all S models from Audi, the SQ5 TDI plus delivers its power to the road via the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. For the first time on a Q5 variant, a sports differential at the rear axle actively distributes the drive power between the wheels. More immediately noticeable clues to the plus version’s status can be found externally, where its rank is conveyed by gloss black 21-inch cast aluminium Audi Sport wheels in 5-twin-spoke star design and an extended black gloss package taking in the exterior mirror housings, door handles, roof edge spoiler and rear diffuser. A further visual customisation feature on the exterior are two clasps that join the four exhaust tailpipes in pairs. Inside, diamond stitched fine Nappa leather upholstery further enhances the SQ5 sports seats in the plus version, and the sliding rear bench seat plus also features as standard to increase variability and enlarge the luggage compartment, if necessary. (Audi Press Release). Audi celebrates the 20th anniversary of the A3. Audi celebrates the 20th anniversary of the A3 Audi A3 lineup over the years Company has built 3,647,833 A3s since 1995 Entry-level luxury cars are all the rage these days so it's interesting to note the Audi A3 helped to kick start that trend twenty years ago.
The first model rolled off the assembly line on September 18th, 1995 and Audi says the car helped to set ""new standards in the compact class with its sporty character, high-quality workmanship and optional quattro all-wheel drive system.""
More recently, the model has grown in popularity as Audi has introduced an A3 sedan and several eco-friendly variants including the e-tron and g-tron.  In total, the A3 is sold in more than 100 markets and Audi has built 3,647,833 units since 1995.
In a statement, Audi Board Member Prof. Dr. Hubert Waltl said “20 years of the Audi A3 – that is 20 years of success in the compact class. Back then, we founded a new segment with the A3. Today, the high-volume A3 family is a fixed component of our model lineup."" Source: Audi
Rate: Published 2 minutes a go By Michael Gauthier Posted in: Audi Classics German Tags: A3 Audi A3 hide show show\/hide press release Audi A3 celebrates 20th anniversary
From Ingolstadt car to internationally successful product
Over 3.5 million units built worldwide
Prof. Waltl, Audi Board Member for Production: “The Audi A3 established the compact class in the premium segment”
A production milestone has been reached at the Audi plant in Ingolstadt: Exactly 20 years ago, on September 18, 1995, the first Audi A3 came off the assembly line here. Since then, the Audi Group has built over 3.5 million units of the successful model worldwide. Today, one out of five Audi cars delivered comes from this model line. At the same time, the Audi A3 is a ground breaking car when it comes to alternative drive systems – as demonstrated by the flexible production of the A3 Sportback e-tron, A3 Sportback g-tron and classic A3 models. They are all built on the same production line at the Ingolstadt plant.
“20 years of the Audi A3 – that is 20 years of success in the compact class. Back then, we founded a new segment with the A3. Today, the high-volume A3 family is a fixed component of our model lineup,” says Prof. Dr. Hubert Waltl, Audi Board Member for Production. “Two decades of the Audi A3 – and behind it a highly qualified production team. Without them, such a success story would not have been conceivable.”
Peter Mosch, Chairman of the Audi General Works Council: “The Audi A3 is a very strong pillar for protecting jobs. That is why the Works Council supports continued production of such important models here at the home plant in Ingolstadt. Job growth over the past 20 years alone confirms that this is the right path.”
When it made its debut, the Audi A3 was already setting new standards in the compact class with its sporty character, high?quality workmanship and optional quattro all?wheel drive system. At the Ingolstadt production site, innovative production technologies and maximum flexibility in body manufacturing have been guaranteeing this top quality right up to today. Here, Audi produces the Audi A3, A3 Sportback, A3 Sportback e?tron and A3 Sportback g?tron models. In 2014 alone, this represented a total of 188,465 automobiles.
Meanwhile, the compact car from Ingolstadt has become a global player. It has conquered the roads in over 100 sales markets, and it is also manufactured at other Audi production sites. In 2001, the Audi Group had already extended portions of A3 production to its production site in Györ. Today, the Audi A3 Sedan and A3 Cabriolet come off the assembly line at that plant, and in 2014 production volume there was 117,578 models. Last year, a total of 46,000 Audi A3 Sportback and A3 Sedan cars were produced at the Chinese plant in Foshan. 10,000 additional A3 Sedans were built in Aurangabad, India. Very soon, the premium brand will be producing the A3 Sedan in Brazil as well. Total production volume since the car made its debut 20 years ago is 3,647,833 A3 models.
Series production of the first plug?in hybrid model at the Ingolstadt plant is a ground?breaking achievement in the direction of electric mobility. Here, Audi is producing the Audi A3 Sportback e?tron in the same cycle time and on the same line as conventional A3 models. Demand is especially strong in the Netherlands where every second Audi A3 Sportback car sold is an e-tron. Chinese customers have been able to buy the Audi A3 e?tron since July. It will launch in the USA at the end of 2015.
The brand with the four rings also produces the low?emission Audi A3 Sportback g?tron on the existing A3 production line in Ingolstadt. The g?tron is the first natural?gas powered car to be produced by the brand. The model can use either fossil?based natural gas or climate-protecting Audi e?gas as fuel. The g?tron is especially popular in Italy where one out of nine A3 Sportback cars sold is powered by natural gas.

Labour To Launch Review Of All Taxes. VW diesel scandal expands to Audi: 2.1 million more cars affected. The Volkswagen Group's dirty diesel scandal continues to expand, now affecting more than 2.1 million cars worldwide from its Audi division. The majority of the cars are in Western Europe, but thousands are on American roads. The Audi powerplant is reflected in an Audi Quattro in Brussels, Sept. 28, 2015. Volkswagen, facing a scandal for the falsification of US emissions tests, has said 11 million cars worldwide had defeat devices installed, including 2.1 million of Audi of models A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5. (Yves Herman\/Reuters\/File) In the wake of the company's bombshell admission that it used a software-based ""defeat device"" to fool emissions testing on its TDI diesels, we've seen the resignation of CEO Martin Winterkorn and a corporate restructuring. Now news comes that 2.1 million cars from its Audi division are affected. While the majority of those vehicles are in western Europe, which has more lax pollution restrictions than the United States, as many as 13,000 are currently on American roads. In a statement Audi said the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 were among the models equipped with the ""defeat device"" software. At this point, Volkswagen Group has announced no comprehensive plan to fix its vehicles to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards. The company is facing fines of up to $18 billion dollars in the U.S. alone, and last week, the German giant retained the legal services of Kirkland & Ellis LLP. The firm recently represented BP for its negligence in regard to the Deepwater Horizon disaster off the coast of Louisiana. For a complete breakdown of the scandal, head to Green Car Reports.

Audi says 2.1m of its cars were fitted with emission cheating software, as Volkswagen is said to have suspended the research and development heads of three divisions. 
 
The luxury car brand, which is a subsidiary of Volkswagen, has admitted that millions of its vehicles with so-called EU5 engines have an emissions ""cheat device"" installed. 
 
The news comes as reports suggest the R&D chief of Audi, along with those of Volkswagen's core passenger car division and sports car maker Porsche, is reported to have been put on leave. 
 
All three companies have declined to comment. 
 
Volkswagen was forced to apologise last week after it was discovered that it had developed the device in order to trick emission tests in the US. 
 
The devices are able to detect when cars are undergoing tests, and can switch the vehicle to a low emission mode in order to achieve more favourable results. 
 
This means that many people have bought cars which are much less environmentally friendly than they had been led to believe. 
 
According to the Audi spokesman, around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe are fitted with the device, with 577,000 in Germany. 
 
Another 13,000 Audi cars in the US are affected. 
 
Vehicle lines involved include the Audi A1, A3, A4, A5, A6 and the TT, Q3 and Q5 models. 
 
Volkswagen said last week that around 11 million of its cars worldwide have been fitted with the cheat device. 
 
Then CEO of the Volkswagen Group,  Martin Winterkorn, has been forced to resign over the revelations and was replaced by Matthias Müller, who has been the chief of another Volkswagen subsidiary, Porsche, since 2. Former VW chief investigated as Audi says 2.1 million cars were rigged. German prosecutors have opened an investigation against former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn in the company’s emissions-rigging scandal.

Today Audi announced which of its models feature the same cheating device used by Volkswagen to pass international diesel emissions standards. Included is none other than the 2010 Green Car of the Year, the Audi A3 TDI. As reported earlier today, the Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal includes about 2.1 million Audi models worldwide, with about 14,000 making it to America. http:\/\/jalopnik.com\/volkswagen-wil...

The remaining vehicles, assumedly around 2,400 models, are current-generation 2015 model year A3 TDIs, which use urea injections to reduce emissions unlike the older diesel engines - though they are still noncompliant with EPA standards due to the cheating mechanism. There was no 2014 model year for the Audi A3 in America. The 3.0 liter V6 diesel engine used on the A6, Q5, and Q7 models in the U.S. is not included in the scandal. Overseas models affected include the A4 and A6, and Q3 and Q5 crossovers, but diesel options of these vehicles were not sold stateside. Audi of America said it is currently working on a plan to fix the affected models with the EPA and California Air Resources Board “as soon as possible” according to the report. There is no official announcement of a recall for any vehicles affected by Dieselgate, but once a plan is established owners will be notified of what they need to do. Volkswagen Group has been given until October 7th to present a plan of action by the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, and it is reported by Reuters that they have established plans to begin fixing affected cars soon. If that works out, expect a similar plan from Audi to follow shortly after. The sooner the better..

By Sohee Kim

SEOUL, Sept 22 (Reuters) - South Korea said on Tuesday it would investigate emissions of three VW and Audi diesel cars after maker Volkswagen AG admitted rigging emissions tests on diesel-powered vehicles in the United States.

If problems are found, South Korea's environment ministry said its probe could be expanded to all German diesel imports, which have surged in popularity in recent years in a market long dominated by local producers led by Hyundai Motor.

The probe will involve 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles, covering VW Jetta and Golf models and sister company Audi's A3 produced in 2014 and 2015, Park Pan-kyu, a deputy director at South Korea's environment ministry, told Reuters.

The ministry will consider recalling those vehicles after conducting the investigation, he said.

""If South Korean authorities find problems in the VW diesel cars, the probe could be expanded to all German diesel cars,"" he said.

Volkswagen Korea declined to comment.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said last week that Volkswagen, the world's biggest carmaker by sales, used software that deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions and could face penalties of up to $18 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has started a criminal probe, according to media reports.

Suh Sung-moon, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, said the scandal would hurt South Korean demand for Volkswagen and Audi cars and benefit local brands such as Hyundai and sister firm Kia Motors.

""South Korean consumers are very sensitive to news, and this emission news will have an impact on the import market,"" he said.

German car sales in South Korea have soared since a 2011 free-trade deal eliminated duties on vehicles imported from Europe.

Vehicle imports from Germany rose 18.2 percent to $4.5 billion in the first eight months of 2015, South Korean customs data show, following a 42.5 percent increase to $5.8 billion for all of 2014.

Diesel models accounted for 68 percent of all cars imported into the country in the first half of the year.

Volkswagen and Audi accounted for 28.2 percent of all foreign cars sold the in the first eight months of this year in South Korea, according to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association.

Diesel cars from Volkswagen and Audi cheated on clean air rules by including software that made the cars' emissions look cleaner than they actually were, according to federal and California regulators. 

The regulators say that the software on the cars turns up emission controls only when it detects that the car was being tested. 

""The effectiveness of these vehicles' pollution emissions control devices is greatly reduced during all normal driving situations,"" said the Environmental Protection Agency's notice to the company. ""This results in cars that meet emissions standards in the laboratory or testing station, but during normal operation, emit nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the standard."" 

There are nearly 500,000 of these diesel cars on U.S. roads. The models include the VW Jetta, the Beetle and the Golf from model years 2009 through 2015, the Passat from 2014-2015 as well as the Audi A3, model years 2009-2015. The Audi luxury brand is owned by Volkswagen Group. 

Owners of the affected cars do not face health risks, according to the EPA, and can to continue to drive or sell them. But the EPA has ordered VW to recall the cars and fix the violation. No recall has yet been announced. 

Representatives from EPA and the California Air Resources Board, which did the testing that uncovered the problem, would not say whether a change to the software would have a negative impact on the cars' performance or the fuel economy. 

Volkwagen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The EPA did not say how much VW would ultimately be fined for this infraction. 

Diesel cars get much better fuel economy than gasoline powered cars.. About two million rigged VW engines were made at Hungary Audi plant - minister. BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About 2 million of the 11 million diesel engines involved in the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal were manufactured at an Audi (NSUG.DE) plant in western Hungary, Economy Minister Mihaly Varga told private broadcaster TV2 on Tuesday.

Varga also said the government was in talks with Audi as well as German rival Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) premium brand Mercedes, which also has a big factory in Hungary, to assess the potential impact on the local economy.

""I am sure that this will affect Hungarian car manufacturing and the local car industry, but I hope the fallout will be smaller than what the disaster scenarios foreshadow,"" he added.

The minister has previously said that the Hungarian economy could lose 0.3 to 0.6 percent of growth if European car sales decline due to the scandal.

Varga said that ""for the time being"" Hungary had no plans to ban VW cars, after the automaker admitted to hacking its own cars to deceive U.S. regulators about how much their diesel engines pollute.

Audi's plant in Hungary, located in the western town of Gyor, is a key supplier for the VW group. The plant manufactured 1.97 million engines and 135,232 cars last year, according to figures published on its website.

Daimler (DAIGn.DE) also operates a Mercedes factory in Kecskemet in central Hungary which has an annual capacity of 150,000 cars. The automaker has denied that it had manipulated emissions data.

Additionally, the Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster celebrated its European debut at the show making for an all-convertible affair at the Lamborghini booth. While there weren’t any sleek coupes in sight, Lamborghini’s stand has proven to be one of the highlights of the show. Starting with the Huracan Spyder, both bright orange and bright blue examples were displayed. Powering the Huracan Spyder is the same naturally-aspirated 5.2-litre V10 engine as the Huracan coupe. The drop-top therefore produces the same 602 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque. While the Huracan Spyder has grown to 1542 kg, it will still reach 100 km\/h in an impressive 3.4 seconds as well as a top speed exceeding 320 km\/h. Unlike the current model year Lamborghini Huracan, the Huracan Spyder debuts with an engine stop-start system as well as cylinder-on-demand technology. Both of these systems help to improve the Huracan Spyder’s efficiency. As for the Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster, it was displayed in a stunning shade of satin white and adorned with a plethora of matte carbon parts. Among the carbon parts are the rear wing, rear diffuser, air intakes, side skirts and front air intake surrounds. The Frankfurt show car was completed with a set of tightly spoked black wheels.

VW's Audi says 2.1 mn cars fitted with emission-cheat software. Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news) 's top-of-the-range automaker Audi (LSE: 0FG8.L - news) said Monday that 2.1 million of its diesel cars worldwide are fitted with the sophisticated software enabling them to cheat emission tests.

In Germany alone, 577,000 vehicles were affected and 13,000 in the United States, an Audi spokesman said. VW sparked global outrage last week when it admitted that 11 million of its diesel cars are fitted with so-called defeat devices that activate pollution controls during tests but covertly turn them off when the car is on the road.. ​Volkswagen apologizes, stops diesel sales in wake of US emissions cheating scandal. ​Volkswagen apologizes, stops diesel sales in wake of US emissions scandal German automaker orders its US dealerships to halt sales of affected cars and could face nearly $18 billion in federal fines. by Antuan Goodwin @antgoo September 21, 2015 9:08 AM PDT Updated: September 21, 2015 10:37 AM PDT Volkswagen has been accused of using illegal software in its TDI diesel cars. Antuan Goodwin\/CNET Volkswagen Group is apologizing after the US Environmental Protection Agency accused the automaker of using illegal software in its TDI diesel cars to skirt US emissions standards.
In a statement over the weekend, Volkswagen Group CEO Dr. Martin Winterkorn said he's ""deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public."" The German automaker ordered its US Volkswagen and Audi dealerships to halt sales of affected vehicles until a fix can be issued. The EPA claims certain VW and Audi vehicles use software that meets clean diesel emissions standards when hooked up to testing equipment but then switches to a dirtier mode when disconnected. This causes the torquey TDIs to actually spew up to 40 times more tailpipe emissions when driven in the real world.
The affected vehicles are 2009-2015 model year Volkswagen Jetta, Beetle and Golf, the 2014-2015 VW Passat, and 2009-2015 Audi A3, totaling roughly 482,000 diesel passenger cars.
CARB and the EPA allege that roughly 482,000 VW and Audi TDI vehicles are in violation of skirting US emissions standards. Antuan Goodwin\/CNET Depending on the outcome of the EPA and CARB's investigations, the automaker could be hit with a maximum possible fine of $37,500 for each of the vehicles in violation, adding up to a possible $18 billion in federal fines.
In the wake of the scandal, Volkswagen's stock dropped by as much as 23 percent, wiping out about $17.6 billion (€15.6 billion) in shareholder value.
Volkswagen Group said it will be cooperating fully with the EPA and the California Air Resource Board in their investigations. The automaker has also order its own external investigation into the matter, according to its release. A fix for the issue will likely come in the form of an emissions software update issued at local Volkswagen dealerships and service centers.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors have launched a preliminary investigation into Volkswagen subsidiary Audi related to the scandal over rigged emissions, a newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

Wolfram Herrle, chief prosecutor in Audi's hometown of Ingolstadt in southern Germany, was quoted as telling the Funke Media group that a preliminary investigation had been launched to see whether to initiate formal proceedings against the company. 

""We are currently reviewing all the facts in order to decide whether an investigation should be initiated,"" he said. 

Neither the Ingolstadt prosecutors nor Audi were immediately available to comment on the newspaper report. 

Volkswagen has admitted cheating diesel emissions tests in the United States but Germany's transport minister says it also manipulated tests in Europe, where it has much bigger sales, and it faces the worst business crisis in its 78-year history. 

On Monday, the German prosecutor's office said it was investigating former VW boss Martin Winterkorn over ""allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data"" based on charges filed by about 10 unidentified individuals. 

Winterkorn, replaced as chief executive on Friday by company veteran Matthias Mueller, said when he quit last week that he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part and wanted to give the company a new start. 

Among those suspended in the scandal were Ulrich Hackenberg, the head of research and development at premium brand Audi, who oversees technical development across the group. 

Audi has said 2.1 million of its cars were affected by the scandal, including the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. 

""Rescinding the Green Car of the Year® awards for the VW Jetta TDI and Audi A3 TDI is unfortunate but appropriate,"" said Ron Cogan 

However, VW Group has now admitted that its software programming intentionally caused in-lab emissions testing to read significantly lower nitrogen oxide emissions than these vehicles actually produced on the road. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board emissions certifications used in the process of determining award eligibility were thus incorrect, and have since been declared invalid by these government agencies. This means both models would have been ineligible to be finalists in their respective award years.

In returning its award, Audi's Keogh added that, ""Audi has won hundreds of races and thousands of awards throughout its history. But we only want to win fair and square. Therefore, in light of recent developments, we believe the only right thing to do is to return this important recognition of environmental stewardship. We are determined to compete – and hopefully win – Green Car of the Year® awards the proper way in future years.""

The annual Green Car of the Year® award recognizes new vehicle models that best raise the bar in environmental performance. Efficiency, emissions, and overall environmental improvement are considered along with market significance, value, and widespread availability to consumers.

SHARE THIS ARTICLEFormer Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn, among Germany's highest-paid executives before stepping down last week, might not get the final payout he anticipated amid opposition from labor leaders.
Interim Chairman Berthold Huber, an official with the IG Metall union, and other worker representatives, are against granting Winterkorn a big payout, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Winterkorn's role in rigging diesel engines to cheat emissions tests in the U.S. remains under investigation, and labor leaders worry that employees could suffer from the cost of the cleanup. Winterkorn's close ties with unions, which helped him survive a power struggle with former Chairman Ferdinand Piech in April, have rapidly deteriorated as the scandal widens.

— Agent009 (View Profile). 2017 Audi A4 First Drive: Technology, Not Emotion. “Vorsprung durch Technik ,” Audi’s longtime marketing slogan, makes absolutely zero sense to most Americans, but the fifth-generation A4 should make things clear—the car is the virtual embodiment of the slogan, which means “Advancement through Technology.” The car is packed to the brim with technology, so there’s some Wahrheit in der Werbung (Truth in Advertising) here. 
 
The 2017 A4 is an exceedingly intellectual automobile, blowing the academic curve in many respects both for the Audi brand and for the premium-sedan segment in general. Take, for example, the claimed 0.23 coefficient of drag, which not only is Audi’s best ever but places it just 0.01 off the industry-leading claim made for the Mercedes-Benz CLA-class . Audi says it achieved this by moving the mirrors lower on the door panels, smoothing the underbody, and making other minor tweaks learned through comprehensive wind-tunnel testing. The A4 also brings Audi’s cool Virtual Cockpit instrument cluster, inductive phone charging, 30-hue ambient lighting, and Apple CarPlay\/Android Auto functionality. Its laundry list of driving aids includes Traffic Jam Assist (radar-based semiautonomous driving up to 40 mph, including steering) and Exit Warning, which audibly and visually warns occupants exiting the car when an approaching motorist or bicyclist might strike an open door. 
 Style Stands Still  
Progress has not been made in every respect, however. Styling has at best stood still, despite the subtle reconstitution of each body component to impart a longer, wider, more precision-crafted look. The clamshell hood, for example, features four elegant creases, and the shut-lines were moved to the car’s “tornado” line. The headlamps are at once more slitlike and brighter, with standard bixenon or optional all-LED bulbs, while the wider taillamps contain nifty sequential turn-signal strips. The grille is broader, and the car as a whole appears more planted on account of a lower-body “light catcher.” Overall, though, the A4 looks merely refreshed, not redesigned, which is to say it’s as stoic, elegant, and unerringly correct as always. 
 
That’s a shame, since so much was improved elsewhere. Despite having grown 0.5 inch in wheelbase, 1.0 inch in length, and 0.6 inch in width, the 2017 A4 has dropped some 70 to 100 pounds, says Audi, due to extensive use of lightweight materials in key areas, including brake components, suspension parts, and stampings. 
     
 

 

      
In the cabin, front head- and shoulder room have increased, as has rear legroom. A horizontally arranged dashboard dominated by a full-width decorative band that also contains the air vents helps the cabin feel quite spacious if not terribly intimate. Our test car came kitted out with gorgeous open-pore wood and buttery nappa leather that would be at home in the A8, and we can also vouch for the stylishness of the A4’s available patterned aluminum trim. The MMI infotainment system now offers a fixed, 8.3-inch dashtop screen; pinch-and-zoom functionality via a touchpad; and an octet of preset buttons for common functions. But the biggest news inside is the Virtual Cockpit gauge cluster that we have quickly come to admire. Here, as in the new Q7 , it supplements the center screen so as to allow passengers to fiddle with the infotainment system, too. (Audi sports cars with the digital cluster, such as the new TT and R8, do not offer a central screen at all.) 
 Two 2.0s  
A pair of 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines is scheduled to be offered when the car hits U.S. dealerships early next year. One is a turbocharged TFSI gasoline unit pumping out 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, while the other is a diesel unit rated for now at 190 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. (The diesel output might—or might not—change pending an update to VW’s TDI engines in the wake of the emissions scandal involving the engine . Availability may also be delayed.) Both mate to an all-new, seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Unconfirmed at this point but very likely to appear within a year of launch is a less-powerful, Miller-cycle version of the 2.0-liter gas engine , paired with a six-speed manual transmission and likely to top 40 mpg in highway fuel economy. 
 
The A4’s media drive took place near Venice, Italy, immediately following the car’s Frankfurt auto-show debut; the only version available for us to drive was the TFSI Quattro with the DSG automatic. On the back roads between the Venice airport and the scenic Dolomites, the TFSI engine proved impressively torquey and willing to rev to its power peak, and while turbo lag is minimal, midrange throttle response is fabulous. Meanwhile, the DSG’s shifts felt more akin to a conventional automatic’s than, say, the Volkswagen GTI’s DSG, although we’re told that the gearbox will be tuned further for U.S. duty to deliver more responsive takeoff from a stop. 
     
 

 

      
After sampling some early A4 prototypes earlier this year, we said the car “combines control, finesse, and precision into a versatile, distinctly Audi sort of driving character.” All of that still applies, but after our experience with production versions, we’re unable to add words like “nuance,” “engagement,” or “passion” to the car’s lexicon. Even with our test car’s optional adjustable dampers in their most aggressive Dynamic mode, the handling felt rather disembodied. The chief culprit was the quick, precise, but utterly dead steering. Turn-in is surprisingly sharp, and the redesigned multilink front suspension yields very high levels of grip, but a lack of at-the-limit feedback makes it feel as if you’ve programmed in some handling commands and left them to a robot to execute. At a moderate clip, however, when ride comfort and straight-line stability are of higher importance, the A4 is sublime. 
 
Something that the A4 does very, very well is stop. With four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers, the A4’s brakes bite crisply and offer brilliant feel. Much of the braking force is summoned near the top of the pedal travel, like many clampers of Teutonic origin, yet the pedal doesn’t feel like a rock on a stick; it actually travels and gives heaps of feedback along the way. 
 
Heading back toward Venice on the autostrada, we explored the A4’s demeanor at speeds up to 140 mph—some 15 mph shy of its top speed—and found it to remain wholly unfazed. The steering remained generally comatose and the ride stayed pleasant. The lack of wind noise at those speeds bordered on eerie, however, another indication of its general goodness as a luxury car. 
 
Quick, sophisticated, and pretty, the 2017 A4 is technically proficient but short on charisma. But we expect fewer folks will be dissuaded by this lack of character than will be wooed by its Vorsprung durch Technik , so even if Audi raises prices when the A4 arrives next spring, the company shouldn’t have much of a problem selling them in vast quantities.

www.caranddriver.com. Here’s why VW’s ‘Dieselgate’ won’t hurt Detroit. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) – The Volkswagen emissions scandal is clearly bad news for VW. And perhaps for other European automakers that sell a lot of vehicles running on diesel. But will it be a huge problem for the entire industry? 

Some have suggested that VW’s cheating on diesel emissions tests in the United States could be a more widespread practice, the auto sector’s equivalent of the Libor interest rate-fixing that big banks went through a few years ago. 

And those fears have clearly spooked investors. They drove away from big U.S. auto stocks as fast as they could on Tuesday. 

Shares of Ford fell nearly 2% while GM dropped 3%. Both stocks were down again on Wednesday. 

The other member of Detroit’s Big Three, Fiat Chrysler, got hit the hardest — probably because it’s half-European. It plunged more than 5% Tuesday. 

Fiat Chrysler did bounce back Wednesday morning, but shares are still down more than 9% since news of VW’s Clean Air Act violations first surfaced last Friday. 

Several auto supplier stocks shifted into reverse as well, particularly ones with significant exposure to VW. 

Gentex was down about 3% Tuesday. Delphi slipped nearly 4% and Tenneco fell more than 6%. BorgWarrner plunged almost 8%. These stocks were all flat Wednesday. 

But some U.S. auto experts think it’s an overreaction to dump the Big Three and their suppliers. 

David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, notes that cars and trucks running on diesel are not that popular in the United States and that sales overall of diesel vehicles are relatively small for Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler. 

What’s more, Whiston said that history has often shown it’s a mistake to punish an entire sector for the sins of just one (or maybe a few) companies. 

“If it comes out that everybody globally was cheating the system, then that’s a godawful story. But I don’t think that’s the case,” he said. “It’s scary when scandals like this happens and people assume the worst. But in hindsight these are usually buying opportunities.” 

Whiston said he thinks the stocks of Ford and GM, which have both fallen more than 10% this year, are extremely cheap. 

Several auto companies have also been quick to defend themselves from accusations of cheating. 

GM’s Opel unit in Europe and Fiat Chrysler have both said they do not put so-called “defeat devices” in their diesel vehicles, referring to the type of software VW used that enabled it to fraudulently pass emissions tests. 

It also looks like concerns that VW suppliers will take a financial hit due to the halting of diesel vehicle sales are overblown as well. 

Parts supplier Tenneco said in a press release Monday that it generated just $7 million in revenue from its VW diesel engine business last year. And global sales were only $310 million. Tenneco reported total sales of $8.42 billion in 2014. 

David Leiker, an auto analyst with Robert W. Baird, said several suppliers have been unfairly dumped. He conceded in a research report Tuesday that there could be some small losses in sales for suppliers with VW ties. 

But he thinks that the VW scandal could benefit other German automakers in the long-run. So the suppliers may be able to win increased business from BMW and Daimler’s Mercedes. 

Leiker also noted that based on Google search trends this week, consumers don’t appear to have a negative perception of Audi just yet — even though VW owns Audi and some Audi models are affected. So the suppliers may wind up losing less VW business than feared if Audi sales hold up well. 

His top supplier picks are Delphi, audio entertainment maker Harman and collision avoidance system manufacturer Mobileye. He said they’re worth buying once the “dust settles” on the VW scandal. 

Joseph Spak, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, also thinks that investors are making too much of VW’s “Dieselgate.” 

“Other automakers could grab share in the wake of [the] short-term hit to VW’s reputation,” he wrote in a a report Tuesday. 

Spak thinks most of the bad news tied to the scandal is already priced into the auto supplier stocks. He thinks Lear, American Axle and Autoliv, which have all fallen this week. should bounce back first. 

Of course, all bets are off if it turns out that everyone in the industry was cheating on the emissions tests. But there’s nothing to suggest that’s the case right now.. ​Volkswagen apologizes, stops diesel sales in wake of US emissions scandal. ​Volkswagen apologizes, stops diesel sales in wake of US emissions scandal German automaker orders its US dealerships to halt sales of affected cars and could face nearly $18 billion in federal fines. by Antuan Goodwin @antgoo September 21, 2015 9:08 AM PDT Updated: September 21, 2015 10:43 AM PDT Volkswagen has been accused of using illegal software in its TDI diesel cars. Antuan Goodwin\/CNET Volkswagen Group is apologizing after the US Environmental Protection Agency accused the automaker of using illegal software in its TDI diesel cars to skirt US emissions standards.
In a statement over the weekend, Volkswagen Group CEO Dr. Martin Winterkorn said he's ""deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public."" The German automaker ordered its US Volkswagen and Audi dealerships to halt sales of affected vehicles until a fix can be issued. The EPA claims certain VW and Audi vehicles use software that meets clean diesel emissions standards when hooked up to testing equipment but then switches to a dirtier mode when disconnected. This causes the torquey TDIs to actually spew up to 40 times more tailpipe emissions when driven in the real world.
The affected vehicles are 2009-2015 model year Volkswagen Jetta, Beetle and Golf, the 2014-2015 VW Passat, and 2009-2015 Audi A3, totaling roughly 482,000 diesel passenger cars.
CARB and the EPA allege that roughly 482,000 VW and Audi TDI vehicles are in violation of skirting US emissions standards. Antuan Goodwin\/CNET Depending on the outcome of the EPA and CARB's investigations, the automaker could be hit with a maximum possible fine of $37,500 for each of the vehicles in violation, adding up to a possible $18 billion in federal fines.
In the wake of the scandal, Volkswagen's stock dropped by as much as 23 percent, wiping out about $17.6 billion (€15.6 billion) in shareholder value.
Volkswagen Group said it will be cooperating fully with the EPA and the California Air Resource Board in their investigations. The automaker has also ordered its own external investigation into the matter, according to its release. A fix for the issue will likely come in the form of an emissions software update issued at local Volkswagen dealerships and service centers.

Many thanks for tuning in, and be sure to check back on the website tomorrow for more coverage from our team in Frankfurt. 

Back in the real world (although still firmly in the clutches of the industry's SUV fever), we find Steve Huntingford: 

The outgoing Kia Sportage has racked up almost 1.7 million sales – 300,000 more than the previous two versions combined. 

It was helped by the boom in demand for compact SUVs, but the looks also played a big part in its success - the old Sportage is a genuinely good looking car. 

And so to the new model, and I've got to admit I'm not completely sold. The side and rear are attractive enough, but from the front it's reminiscent of a Subaru Tribeca. 

In addition, while Kia's design boss Peter Schreyer described the interior as ""on a level with the premium brands"" the reality is more solid than swish. 

Front- and four-wheel-drive models will be offered, and updated versions of the familiar 1.7- and 2.0-litre diesel engines will be available. Expect a plug-in hybrid to join the range later in the car's life. 

Has Kia switched off the lights to save money? 

We haven't mentioned the huge (impact) of the Bentley Bentayga SUV yet, so it's over to Chris Knapman again: 

Bentley has two of its new Bentayga SUV on its stand, both of which are attracting a fair bit of attention. However, while the bronze model is in a relatively restrained (for a £160,000 SUV) spec, the 

orange one looks as though it's been to Max Power for a makeover. 

Horrible carbon details, including the front splitter, side vents, mirrors and rear diffuser, not to mention massive side sills complete with silver Bentley logo, make this thing look, frankly, awful. 

Still, with 3,000 orders Bentley has already sold the first year's allocation, and it's hard to see the Bentayga showing any signs of slowing down. You can keep the carbon bits though. 

The more restrained of the two Bentaygas on the Bentley stand 

Not enough supercars for you? Here's the latest from Lamborghini, courtesy of Chris Knapman: 

Lamborghini's stand is all about roadsters, with the recent Aventador Superveloce Roadster flanked by a pair of Huracan Spyders. 

Frankfurt marks the debut of the roofless V10 Lambo, which replaces the Gallardo Spyder. Like that car, the Huracan uses an electrically-operated soft-top, this time able to fold in 17 seconds at speeds up to 31mph. 

The 5.2-litre V10, meanwhile, pushes out 602bhp through all four wheels, meaning 0-62mph in just 3.4sec. 

It costs just over £200,000. 

I was right, blue really is this season's colour for drop-top Italian supercars 

We can't talk about supercars without mentioning Ferrari. Here's what Steve Huntingford found at its stand: 

Ferrari has admitted that it could go back to building six-cylinder cars in the future to help it meet ever-tightening emissions regulations. 

Its CEO Amedeo Felisa said: ""Will six cylinders be the future? Probably, yes. But I think we're on a good path at the moment and won't need to change to another until at least 2020."" 

That current path includes the new open-top, Spider version of the V8-engined 488, which has arrived just six months after the coupé. 

In the past, Spider models have been two years behind, but Ferrari decided to rethink that strategy after customer feedback showed that most Spider customers wouldn't even consider the coupe, and vice versa. 

While the 488 Spider is 50kg heavier than the coupé, it can still accelerate from 0-62mph in 3sec and reach a top speed of 203mph. 

Prices won't be confirmed until October, but the old 458 Spider cost £20,500 more than the coupé, which suggests a starting point of about £205,000 for the new car. 

The red cars from Maranello are now blue, apparently. It's a lovely colour - the car's not bad either 

More supercar wildness, this time from Bugatti. Chris Knapman has the details: 

If the Porsche Mission E is the star car of the Frankfurt motor show, then the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo runs it a close second. Or at least it would if it wasn't the work of fantasy. 

For in fact the Bugatti isn't the successor to the Veyron, but a concept designed for the Gran Turismo computer game, Bugatti having followed in the footsteps of Aston Martin and Peugeot, which also created one-off cars for the driving simulator. 

Still, that hasn't stopped Bugatti creating a full spec for the car, which is powered, like the Veyron, by a W16 engine driving all four wheels, with a theoretical top speed of more than 250mph. 

While a pure concept, it is likely the elements of the Project Gran Turismo's design will feature on the next Veyron, due in 2017. 

Bugatti's blue period: the Vision GT is real, but won't race 

It must have been a very special Volkswagen indeed to deter unashamed Porsche fan Chris from his main object of desire, the Mission E: 

Here it is, then, the star car of Frankfurt 2015: the Porsche Mission E. 

Interesting car, this, a fully electric four-seater with a 300-mile range and the ability to accept an 800-volt charge meaning you can take it to 80 per cent of battery capacity in just 15 minutes. 

I think we can agree, too, that it looks sensational, its noise scraping the ground, rear arches swollen like an old 935's. 

The interior is equally dramatic, the rear seats accessed via admittedly fragile looking suicide doors. And the deep-dished steering wheel is a work of art. 

Porsche quotes performance of 0-62mph in 3.5sec (a tenth off a 911 Turbo), the Mission E's 2-tonne kerb weight not enough to dent the impact of the two electric motors (one per axle, making the car four-wheel drive). 

Some have speculated that this car is a precursor to a new Porsche saloon that will sit below the Panamera in the German firm's line-up, but a company spokesman insisted that it was a pure concept. 

It also raises the question of Porsche building a credible rival for the Tesla Model S, which in dual motor guise can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 3.2sec. 

Anyway, you know it's special because of all the cars in Frankfurt it's the one that's most difficult to get close enough to in order to get a half-decent picture. 

Chris was so excited by the Mission E but unfortunately failed to deliver the killer photo 

Performance is on the cards at Volkswagen too, as Chris Knapman reports: 

I was hot-footing it over to the Porsche stand to see the Mission E, but this Volkswagen Golf GTE Sport concept made me stop in my tracks. It's actually the second outing for this car, which made its debut at the Worthesee tuning festival in Austria back in May. However, it's no less striking for it. 

Carbon-fibre body, gullwing doors and under the skin a version of the 1.6-litre engine from the Polo World Rally Car, boosted by two electric motors. The typically implausible figures read 400bhp, 495lb ft of torque and 117mpg on the EU Combined cycle. 

Impressive. 

Impressive stuff from Volkswagen 

German metal (no, not The Scorpions) caught the eye of Steve Huntingford: 

BMW tuner Alpina is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a special Edition 50 version of its B6 Biturbo Coupe. 

Fans of Eighties Alpinas will be particularly keen on the body graphics, although it's the classic B7S Turbo, which is also on the stand, that really catches the eye. 

Meister werke: classic Alpina B7S Turbo 

More from Andrew English about developments at Mercedes: 

Wind in your hair motoring is also big at Mercedes-Benz. 

Not one, but two cabriolets are launched on the Mercedes stand, with the new Smart ForTwo cabiro vying for attention with the world premiere of the new S-class cabrio, which is finished in a classy kind of flat-white livery. They both go on sale next spring, but at wildly different prices. 

It's off to South Korea and Hyundai for Alex Robbins: 

Hyundai has gone on a bit of a splurge here at Frankfurt - not only are they showing off their new i20 Active, a jacked-up i20 which makes the Rover Streetwise of 15-odd years ago look rather prescient, but there's also a couple of concepts and the new i20 WRC rally car. 

The rally car looks rather good, I must be said; the i20 transforms well into a racer, and with its big arches and pugnacious front end, it's probably one of the smarter rally cars out there. 

Presented alongside it is Hyundai's Vision GT - the latest in a long line of Vision GT concepts developed solely to be playable in the Gran Turismo racing game. No, it won't race at Le Mans, then, although it doesn't half look like a P1 prototype. Go on, Hyundai - you know you want to. 

Both Vision GT and i20 WRC are emblazoned with a swooping 'N' - this is Hyundai's new sporty sub-brand, presumably chosen because all the more sporting letters of the alphabet were taken by Ford, Audi and Jaguar, et al. Or, if you were really stretching things, you might say Hyundai was trying to go one better than BMW's M Division. 

Finally, there's the rather gauche Vision G Coupé, a sort of coupé version of the Genesis that could pre-empt a production model. It's apparently been designed around the notion of chivalry. Hmmm. We'll leave you to make up your own mind about whether chivalry is particularly pretty. 

Make up your own mind about the Vision G Coupé. The chap on the left doesn't seem convinced 

Another Hyundai vision, one that's destined for computer screens rather than actual racetracks. No, we don't know why that bloke is taking a photo of the floor, either 

Neither has Steve Huntingford, who sends this reminder of the overwhelming vastness of the Frankfurt motor show (Andrew English famously wore a pedometer one year and covered almost 25 miles on the show's press day): 

It's hard to get your head around the scale of the Frankfurt motor show. It took 850 tons of steel to build, plus there's 4,500 lights, 23km of cable, 9,000 square metres of floor space and three floors. 

And that's just the Mercedes stand... 

The Mercedes-Benz take on the cathedral of the motor car 

At least Chris Knapman hasn't lost his sense of humour. Yet. 

Chris says: 'I like the Smart car as much as anybody, but this is stretching it' 

More on aerodynamics from Andrew English: 

Aerodynamics are something of a theme at the show with Audi and Mercedes-Benz fielding cars with moveable aerodynamic devices. 

One development which might be seen on production sometime soon are the Audi e-tron concept's rear-view cameras which, according to chief aerodynamisist Moni Islam, are worth another 6km of electric driving range. The VW Group has already used such cameras on the XL-1 super eco car, where they helped achieve its extraordinary 313mpg capability. 

""The aerodynamics will have to be improved,"" says Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi's director of technical development. ""I set our engineers a target of 0.25 [coefficient of drag] for the e-tron concept. Of course we can't realise all those aero features and we would need homologation for rear-view cameras, and we don't have moveable wings in production at the moment, but it's possible."" 

Andrew English presents his early contender for Car of the Show: 

I'm having a bit of a crush on the Mercedes-Benz Concept IAA (Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile). 

Aero is a bit of a theme at the show as car makers realise they can have extra range, better fuel consumption and lower emissions for free if they design it right in the first place. 

At speeds above 50mph the Concept IAA grows by 390mm, deploys extra flaps in the body and fins in the bumper and its wheels go from concave to flat discs to improve the Cd value from 0.25 to 0.19. It also looks fabulous, with elements of the old Gullwing in the rear three-quarter view. 

The driveline is mostly that of the C350e with a plug-in hybrid system capable of delivering CO2 emissions as low as 28g\/km. 

Aero and dynamic: the Mercedes-Benz ConceptIAA 

More from our French correspondent for today, Chris Knapman: 

Just when you thought you'd seen all the French manufacturers's stands, you remember DS. 

Now a brand in its own right of course, DS is all about boutique finishes and design exclusivity. The lady sitting at a table handcrafting leather inserts for the key fobs was a nice touch, but it's still hard not to feel underwhelmed looking at a selection of rebadged Citroens. Especially when there's also a gorgeous original DS on display. 

Also hiding under a white sheet (finest silk, presumably) is the DS 4 Cross Concept, a showcase for future DS models that uses ""unprecedented materials, such as finely cut stone to embellish wheel rims"". Whoopee. 

Nice French lady hand-stitches DS keyfobs and gearlevers, while scruffy journalist (you'll always find Team Telegraph in suits) performs a DIY backrub 

Back on earth, Chris Knapman has more on the new Citroën C4 Cactus convertible: 

The Convertible Cactus M concept is good fun. Think modern-day beach buggy complete with surfboards on the roof. 

Citroën says the Cactus M was inspired by the Méhari, a simple and rugged off-roader based on the 2CV and built by the company from 1968-88. 

Neat details include the wooden windscreen frames and cutouts in the side of the bodywork so you can climb in the back without opening the 

doors. 

I can't see it making production, sadly. 

Open-air fun: look closely, and you'll see that the 'roof' is actually a pair of surfboards 

More of Andrew English's travails on the Audi stand, but at least he has more info on what's tipped to be the next Audi A6: 

Back in the pressure chamber that is Audi's Agora (meaning Greek 'open space for meeting', which Audi's agora is anything but), we've garnered some more stuff about the e-tron concept, which is being widely tipped as the new Q6. 

It's Audi's first full production battery electric car, as the R8 sports car is built to order, and its lithium-ion battery gives it a range of 500km, with 0-62mph in 4.6sec. This is into Tesla territory, of course, but Audi claims the car can be recharged to 80 per cent of capacity in just three hours using high current charging. 

There's also the option of inductive charging, although since this is a concept Audi isn't saying how near production that system is. 

There are three motors, one for the front wheels and one for each rear wheel. The design uses no less that five moveable aerodynamic devices including retractable bonnet flaps and rear spoilers. 

""The wing mirrors are worth up to 10 counts of aerodynamic efficiency,"" says Moni Islam, head of aerodynamics at Audi. ""That's about six kilometres of range."" 

Its design is down to Gary Telaak, but under the guise of Marc Lichte, Audi head of design. 

The air's running out so we've got to get out of here now, but we'll be back later if we can borrow a space suit. 

Interesting how people view cars. Here's Alex Robbins' take on the Jeep Renegade. We're just glad that there's so much choice. 

Some rather neat Jeep-related details in and around the new Renegade. It's just a shame Chris Knapman reckons the rest of the car is a bit disappointing. 

One of the details on the Renegade that Alex found so appealing 

Apologies for the delay, few technical issues. 

On with the Frankfurt madness, and it doesn't get any madder than this strange image from Andrew English, performing something called a Selfie Jump on the Opel\/Vauxhall stand. 

Mr Knapman has more on the Bentley Bentayga SUV. More specifically, its extraordinary timepiece: 

In case you missed it from our Twitter feed yesterday, here's the Bentley Bentayga. Or more specifically, the Breitling Mulliner Tourbillon clock from the Bentley Bentayga, which might just be the world's most expensive optional extra: it costs a staggering £103,000. 

I wonder if the Queen has ticked that box for her new Bentayga? 

Ticking off: is this the world's most expensive car option? 

Chris Knapman has also visited Toyota: 

Lots of hybrids over at Toyota. There's the new RAV4 hybrid, the new C-HR hybrid concept, plus GS and RX 450 hybrid models from Lexus. Oh, and of course, there's the new Prius, aka the world's bestselling hybrid, as mentioned by Andrew English. 

First shown at the New York motor show, the RAV4 uses a 2.5-litre engine plus electric motors on both axles, making it four-wheel drive, all borrowed from the Lexus NX300h. at the Telegraph Cars YouTube channel. 

The car has also been given a makeover inside and out, with design details taken from the recent Avensis facelift and more soft-touch materials for the interior. A touchscreen is also standard, plus Toyota offers its full range of active safety systems. 

Ploished performer: the Toyota RAV4 hybrid

Alex Robbins finds a familiar face at the Fiat stand: 

Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Yes, it's the new Fiat 500, just as cute as ever - and spot-the-difference similar to the previous version. 

Fiat says it's because it didn't want to meddle with an icon. And in fairness, if it ain't broke, why fix it? Despite its age, the 500 is still selling by the shed load, so tweaking the recipe too much could be bad news. 

There are two main reasons people buy a 500: one is the way it looks, and the other is the way you can personalise it. On that latter point, there's now an even wider range of paint finishes and decal packs than before - as this example, with its slightly bizarre tear-here dashed line motif, demonstrates. 

If it ain't broke... the Fiat 500 

Steve Huntingford reports on the new Infiniti Q30, set to rival the Audi A3 and BMW 1-series: 

The new Q30, Infiniti's answer to prestige hatchbacks such as the Audi A3 and BMW 1-series, will ""help you feel connected with the road, thanks to the design of its seat,"" according to the car's chief engineer, Graham Cornforth. 

Apparently, it's all to do with the backrest matching the shape of your spine and remaining in contact for an extra couple of vertebrae. 

Cornforth also points out that you sit 70mm higher than you do in most rivals, which gives a good forward view, although rear visibility is less impressive, with the rear window little more than a slot, and the rear head restraints quite bulky. 

Infiniti is promising comfort, refinement and handling to match the best cars in the class, which would be no mean feat - especially given the fact the Q30 is related to the Mercedes A-class, one of the noisiest and worst-riding cars of its kind. 

However, Cornforth and his team have done a considerable amount of testing on UK roads. And he's keen to downplay the Mercedes link. ""It won't feel like an A-class,"" he said. ""Yes, we have used some of the same chassis parts, but we have taken them in a different direction."" 

Infiniti has assured us that the new Q30 won't feel like the Mercedes A-class with which it shares parts 

More on the Alfa Giulia, from Steve Huntingford: 

A couple of months ago, at the unveil of Alfa Romeo's new Giulia executive saloon, security got quite upset when our Mr Hudson tried to take a picture of the interior. 

Frankfurt was our first chance to have a proper look inside, then, and it seems smart - at least in the top spec that's at the show - with the customary cowled instruments and an attractive steering wheel that incorporates a bright red starter button, Ferrari-style. 

Alfa Romeo has also shunned the current trend for touchscreens, and instead followed the example of Audi and BMW by fitting a large rotary controller between the front seats, which you use to scroll through onscreen menus. 

At last, a decent pic of the Giulia's interior. No touchscreen malarkey here, although we like the red starter button on the steering wheel 

Oh dear, Andrew English encountered a few problems at Audi's monstrous stand (actually that's not fair to Audi, as all the stands of the German manufacturers are monstrous): 

Inappropriate Audis are a worldwide problem as they appear, unbidden, at events ferrying celebrities, hacks and management, but that is nothing compared with the company's stand at Frankfurt, which occupied the centre space normally used by BMW. 

Claustrophic and overcrowded, there was only one escalator into this overheated space and one escalator out, which broke at the end of the presentation. Less than amusing pushing and shoving made it quite frightening getting clear. 

The featured car was the E-tron concept, the first proper vehicle from Marc Lichte, Audi's head of design. From what we could see of it, it's a very smart shooting break without wing mirrors. 

We'll come back to this when the stand clears a bit. 

It's not all go, as Chris Knapman explains: 

Not much happening over at Nissan. The revised Leaf can now go up to 107 miles between charges thanks to a 30kWh battery pack. It's only available on top-spec models, though (the range of the entry-level car is still 84 miles). 

And there's a concept car set for a 1.15pm reveal. 

Next! 

The Nissan Gripz concept awaits unveiling - but it sounds like Chris won't be there to see it 

The new Alfa Romeo Giulia is making its debut at Frankfurt. Alex Robbins has the details: 

A return to past glories, or merely trading on an illustrious history? That's the big question surrounding the Alfa Romeo Giulia. Either way, Alfa isn't being shy about reminding you of its back catalogue here, the Giulia dominating its stand alongside its namesake - the original Giulia Ti of 1962 - and a Giulia TZ coupé. 

The Giulia has a huge job on its hands, as does its maker; convincing the world of Alfa Romeo's place alongside BMW, Mercedes and Audi as a true premium brand. 

At least it looks the part; in the flesh, it's even better than the pictures, with a scowling front end and a stubby tail. The top-of-the-range version sounds pretty intense, too - with a 510bhp V6 capable of 62mph from rest in just 3.9sec, it shows Alfa means business. 

Will it succeed? I hope so. After all, the failure of the Giulia could mean the failure of Alfa Romeo itself - and nobody wants to see that happen. 

Handsome beast: the range-topping Giulia Quadrifoglio, which has more than 500bhp and four-wheel drive 

Under the skin, we suspect there's a good deal in common with the Maserati Ghibli 

The original Giulia saloon, a sporty TI model. Alfa has a richer heritage than most, so why not flaunt it? 

A veritable feast of Vauxhall Astra-related information, all of a suddden. Chris Knapman says: 

Talk of the devil. Quite a handsome thing it is, too, looking wider than it actually is on account of the large grille. 

The Astra's interior is smartly finished, with a large touchscreen and beautifully simple dials. There's quite bit more space than in the back of the Renault Megane, too. 

Vauxhall is also showing the new Astra estate here, although it's boot doesn't look like a match for the Peugeot 308 SW's. 

(Ed's note: Wrong, Chris, English has just informed us that it's class-leading). 

Anyway, some pictures: 

The smart new Astra. Is it me, or does the Opel\/Vauxhall stand look like a Top of the Pops set from the 1980s? 

Driver's eye view of the new Opel\/Vauxhall Astra 

The secretive Astra Sports Tourer. Yes, it's definitely a 1980s Top of the Pops set 

Talking of which, Andrew English has some details on a Vauxhall for which few details exist: 

We're still struggling with whether the new, Astra-based Vauxhall Sports Tourer estate is a good looking car or not - we think it might be. 

Actually that's about all we know about the car for which details are remarkably scant. There are few technical details other than a maximum cargo space which at 1,630 litres is at the top of the class. 

It goes on sale alongside the new Astra next month with deliveries starting at the end of the year, although we won't be driving it until early spring - go figure. 

Chris Knapman is perplexed: 

It's amazing how many people are interested in cars that aren't all that new. When writing these snippets I tend to seek out the oldest model I can find in order to have somewhere quiet to sit. 

The Vauxhall\/Opel Adam I'm in is a prime example. Or at least it would be if people weren't crawling all over it. Don't they know there's a new Astra to see? 

No resting place for Knapman here. The oddly popular Opel\/Vauxhall Adam. 

More from Andrew English on developments at Toyota, specifically its Mirail, the world's first mass-production hydrogen fuel-cell-powered car: 

Softly, softly, catchee monkey, would seem to be the strategy at Toyota for the Mirai when it goes on sale next year. Worldwide supplies will be restricted to just 700 in the first year, according to Gerald Killman, Toyota Motor Europe's vice-president of research and development. ""We are experienced in rolling out all new technologies as we have with hybrid,"" he says, ""but for one car maker to rollout a technology that requires a new infrastructure is very difficult."" 

That's why Toyota is cooperating with rival makers such as BMW and equipment manufacturers to ensure that the infrastructure keeps pace with the vehicle supply and vice versa - the chicken and egg business, as it's widely summarised. 

Europe will get only between 50 and 100 Mirais in the first year and although they will be available to buy or lease, Toyota will be concentrating supplies in a handful of cities where a viable refuelling structure exists - think London, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Munich. 

It's a version of a theory put forward initially by Hugo Spowers of the Riversimple project, that if you supply a handful of cars to an urban area with one refuelling station, the resulting demand will ensure a return for the supplier and the cars will act as advertisements encouraging a local market. 

Killman says that there are a lot of issues still to be solved, but he is pleased to report that the refuelling technical standards are not one of them. The tanks, the valving, the pipe work and the nozzles are all agreed, he says, which is in sharp contrast to the electric recharging structure which was promised to be common across the world but isn't. ""Hydrogen is the only fuel where there is global stabilisation of standard,"" he says, ""and we are all working to the same designs for the roll out of fuel stations, which has the potential to keep a lid on costs, but also means you don't have to re-validate the vehicle everytime a new fuel station opens."" 

Andrew English has been putting in the miles (and there are plenty of miles to be put in around the Frankfurt show halls): 

The new, fourth-generation Prius is the first example of Toyota's archetypal hybrid to be based on a mass production road car platform (all its predecessors have had specially designed, lightweight chassis which was also rather too flexy on occasions). 

So new Prius, which goes on sale next year, sits on Toyota's New Global Architecture (TNGA), which will eventually underpin all its road cars. This architecture has been developed in response to company head Akio Toyoda's demand the all Toyota's car should be good to drive, so TNGA means a lower centre of gravity and modular systems engineering to lower costs and commonise parts and sub-assemblies. 

Few technical details are available, but we understand the driveline will be the same twin-motor epicyclic system as in all previous Prius models, but updated, made more powerful and more efficient. More details will be available around the time of the Tokyo motor show in October. 

Another car to use the TNGA will be the C-HR concept, which is an attractive design study for a smallish hybrid crossover, which was seen in an earlier form at the Paris show this time last year. We're expecting the production version of this car to break cover at the Geneva show next spring. 

More from Chris Knapman at Renault: 

Interestingly Renault has launched a GT model alongside the standard Megane, complete with four-wheel steering. The only car in the C-segment to offer such a system, the Megane GT should in theory be a nimble thing, as well as stable at high speed. The old Laguna GT used a previous version of the Megane's system and was a bit of a sleeper (or wolf in sheep's clothing, if you prefer). 

Engines will be a 201bhp petrol or 163bhp diesel, both with dual-clutch gearbox. Should make for an interesting Golf GTi\/GTD rival when it arrives in the UK mid-2016. 

As with the Clio, Renault has abandoned the three-door Megane, but an estate will follow in late 2016, using an extended platform for extra luggage space. 

Steve Huntingford has details on how Jaguar is taking on Apple: 

While many manufacturers are now fitting Apple or Android infotainment systems in their cars, Jaguar has developed its own system for the new F-Pace SUV and XF saloon. 

Called InControl Touch Pro (catchy), it brings a 10.2-inch touchscreen, iPad-style apps, and the ability to use the sort of pinch and swipe gestures that you do with your smartphone. 

Indeed, Jaguar could soon be a rival to Apple and Android, with two Chinese brands signed up to use its system in their cars and more deals apparently in the pipeline. 

Given that Jaguar's sister brand Land Rover has just updated its Range Rover Evoque, it seems strange that this wasn't given InControl Touch Pro. But according to Peter Virk, head of connected technologies at Jaguar Land Rover, ""we're focusing on the Jaguar car lines at the moment"". 

Virk also dismissed my concerns that all this connectivity technology would quickly date, pointing our that updated versions of the apps can be downloaded, and that you'll be able to take them with you when you replace your car - providing you buy another Jaguar or Land Rover, of course. 

Apologies for the clarity of this image 

Chris Knapman has been practicing his French on the Renault stand: 

Been talking with Andre Abboud, program director for the new Megane. He cited design and technology as the most important elements of the new family hatchback, allowing it to find stand out in a very busy part of the market. 

""We don't focus on one competitor, but look at the whole market. So we have a modern car based on a dynamic, distinctive design,"" he said. 

Space is important though, and the Megane weighs in with the biggest boot in its class (after Peugeot's 308). That's in part because the new Megane is longer and wider than the model it replaces, yielding more space inside. 

New production processes mean that it's no heavier, though. Abboud says they've saved 90kg from the old car, through processes such as hot-stamping the metal sheets. 

BMW's new boss fainted during the presentation of new models. I hope Alex Robbins' presence had nothing to do with it. 

Alex Robbins again, with more new product from BMW: 

This is the new BMW X1. It's certainly easier on the eye than the last one, but is it me or is there a hint of Ford EcoSport about the rear? 

If I'm right, that isn't a good thing. 

Alex likes the car, I'm more taken by the cardboard rocks in the background, reminiscent of a 1950s B-movie 

More from Mr Robbins, who is ploughing a lonely furrow around the BMW group stands. Here's what he found at Rolls-Royce: 

It's a hypothetical question for most of us, of course, but... Would you splash out on a Phantom Drophead Coupé when the new Dawn is such a looker - and costs more than £100,000 less? 

Of course, for some people, nothing but the best will do. But I suspect my money would actually go on the more wieldy Dawn. 

I say this without having driven the thing, of course, but the Wraith - on which the Dawn is based - is a perfectly lovely thing. I suspect Rolls-Royce won't have ruined it in the transition, and the Dawn is supposedly going to be even softer and more cosseting. 

It's as quiet as a Wraith, too, or so Rolls-Royce says - that fabric hood (chosen ""for reasons of aesthetics and romance"", apparently) has been engineered to be perfectly smooth when raised, to cut down on wind noise. 

And while the Dawn can't match the Phantom for imperiousness, it's undoubtedly the softer and more seductive car. You can, of course, order it with a less outré interior colour scheme than the one on display here - thankfully. 

Expect to see it on sale in early 2015, priced at around £250,000. 

Dawn chorus: we all want one 

Alex Robbins: BMW has this rather splendid doctor's X5 on the stand. 

I can't help feeling this paint job should be an option - I rather like it. Anyone with me? No? Just me, then. 

A BMW X5 in an, er, arresting livery 

Chris again, with a spooky experience at the Peugeot stand: 

Odd experience sitting in a 308 SW to write up my Fractal piece. I also wanted to jot down an additional comment from design director Gilles Vidal, who said the company would be reintroducing buttons for the heater control rather than hiding them in the touchscreen, when the car's stereo starred playing. 

Not some obscure German radio station, as you might expect at Frankfurt, but a Decemberists song. Well, somebody at Peugeot's got good taste, I thought, before swiftly realising it was because I'd plugged my phone in to charge and the car was therefore just connecting to my playlist. 

Still, good news about those heater controls. As you'll see from our long term test of the 308, the touchscreen isn't always the most intuitive to use. 

Chris Knapman writes: 

Interesting chat with Peugeot design director Gilles Vidal, who is showing off the company's latest concept car, the Fractal. 

It is pure concept too, for while the idea of an electric city car with coupe styling isn't all that revolutionary, some of the design details within certainly are. Specifically, Vidal says efforts have focused on making the Fractal as quiet as possible, not just in the noises it makes, but also those it can capture. 

Witness the intricate door linings, created from a 3D printer and then sprayed in further sound-deadening material, their shape proven to capture noise coming from the tyres. 

Quiet revolution: the Peugeot Fractal concept at Frankfurt 

The first press conference of a long day for Alex Robbins, at Mini: 

There's no fear of nostalgia - or, indeed, of negative British Leyland connotations - with the new Mini Clubman. 

Peter Schwarzenbauer, BMW's member of the board for Mini, emerged from an original Clubman to reveal the new car. It's bigger than the last Clubman (making it about 27 times larger than the original, then - PH), with a proper five-door layout, rather than the last model's half-hearted asymmetrical arrangement. 

You still get the quirky double-door arrangement at the back, mind. There are two petrol engines and a diesel, the latter of which is quoted at 68.9mpg and 109g\/km. Prices will start from £19,995, and the new Clubman is already available to order. 

The new Mini Clubman is already on sale 

Nostalgia fest: the original Mini Clubman at the launch of the new one 

Steve again, on something even more extraordinary: 

Still, the Mansory Range Rover is positively understated compared with the bright orange Range Rover pick-up being displayed by Startech. 

Steve Huntingford reflects on a surprisingly muted start to the show: 

It's still relatively quiet at Frankfurt. Or at least it was until the alarm went off on one of the cars being displayed by aftermarket specialist Mansory. 

As if a two-tone, black and gold Range Rover with blacked-out windows and massive body skirts needed to draw more attention to itself. 

Maybe Steve Huntingford has been on the schnapps already, judging by the quality of this picture, but you get the idea. Makes the Bentley Bentayga seem subtle... 

So Chris Knapman likes the Subaru Levorg: 

Maybe it's just the glitz of its motorshow surroundings, but the new Subaru Levorg (making its German debut at Frankfurt) looks distinctly desirable in the metal. 

Not too big, no silly huge wheels, spacious on the inside and nicely finished too. We like. 

The name, incidentally, is a mash-up of Legacy, Revolution and Touring. Does that work? 

Discretion assured: the Subaru Levorg is not too flashy 

Hot news from Nick Gibbs: the Queen is to be the first customer for the 187mph Bentley Bentayga SUV: 

Her Majesty the Queen is set to become the first customer for Bentley’s new 187mph Bentayga – claimed to be the fastest SUV in the world. 

“We have reserved the number one car for her,” Bentley CEO Wolfgang Duerheimer confirmed to the Telegraph at the Frankfurt motor show. 

The Queen already has a one-off state limousine presented to her in 2002 by Bentley and powered by a 400bhp twin-turbo V8. Should she decide to go for the Bentayga SUV, it would be significantly more powerful at 600bhp with the ability to hit 60mph in a supercar-rivalling 4 seconds. 

The car is billed as the most expensive SUV in the world, starting at £160,200, rising to £229,000 for the one of the 500 fully specced First Edition models. 

The Queen has gone straight to the front of a queue that is already stretching out of the door, Bentley said. The first year’s production run of 3,600 cars has been snapped up and the VW-owned firm is planning to increased production so has not to create too huge a waiting list. “We’ve had an extraordinary order intake,” Duerheimer said. 

If the base car seems almost reasonable, then customers can stretch the price past half a million and beyond, the company said. The most extravagant extra is a Breitling Tourbillon clock embedded into the dashboard that costs a staggering £110,000 according to the firm. The timepiece spins on its axis every so often to wind itself up, so drawing no power from the car’s electrical system and fractionally saving fuel compared to a standard electric clock. Duerheimer said the Queen would be able to spec her own car, and won’t be forced to take one of the pre-specced First Edition models. 

Deliveries of the Bentayga start late this year. Bentley has said the W12 petrol model will be joined by diesel and a plug-in hybrid versions before 2018. 

Next it's Chris Knapman with - I should say in - the new Renault Megane: 

Been sitting in the new Megane this morning, or specifically the GT version. Tuned by Renaultsport, it has some of the most aggressively sporty seats yet seen in what is presumably a mere warm hatch. There's also a tablet-style portrait-mounted touchscreen. 

It seemed to work well, but it was set to German so I couldn't really understand what I was looking at. What I can say is that Renault has thankfully not followed Peugeot by integrating the heater controls in the touchscreen; instead you get proper rotary controllers. Cool move. 

The award for most abstract image of the show so far goes to Chris Knapman. Here is a heavily bolstered Renault Megane seat 

Mr English again, with rumours galore from Fiat-Chrysler about a merger with General Motors: 

That long-promised date never materialised as Sergio Marchionne, the boss of Fiat Chrysler, stood up Mary Barra, chief executive of General Motors, by actually not appearing at the Frankfurt Show at all, claiming business commitments elsewhere. 

To allow the truth into this story for a couple of seconds here, Barra never had any intention of meeting the egregious, jumper-sporting Fiat boss who has been courting the General's shareholders for a few months now, telling them that he could realise them greater value if the two companies merged. 

""We've studied [the proposals] in detail and we're really focused on doing things right for GM shareholders,"" said Barra at an eve-of-show press conference. ""We decided [the proposal] wasn't."" 

To be honest it can't have taken that long to work out that Marchionnne's proposals weren't in the best interests of shareholders, let along customers. Take the family hatchback market, for example. Fiat will offer you a Panda-based Fiat 500L, dull but worthy and getting on a bit. GM's European arm, Vauxhall\/Opel, unveiled the new Astra five-door and estate at Frankfurt. 

We're bound by a September 23 embargo until we can tell you what this car is like to drive, but after we drove the prototype version earlier this year we can categorically say that there's simply no contest between it and the Fiat. 

Next up is Andrew English, with some electric news news from General Motors: 

Vauxhall\/Opel Vauxhall is to launch an electric car in Europe, but not Britain. 

Mary Barra, General Motors chief executive, confirmed that not only would its European Vauxhall\/Opel arm offer a sport utility vehicle in future, most likely based on the Cadillac SRX crossover, but that it would also be offering a battery electric vehicle. 

This is likely to be based on the forthcoming Bolt EV, which will have a mooted 200-mile range and will be based on the forthcoming second-generation Volt plug-in extended-range hybrid. 

Trouble is, neither the new Volt or the Bolt will be offered in right-hand drive in spite of the assertion from Barra that GM's attitude to right-hand drive will be improving in future. 

""We'll be looking at what the right vehicles are for right-hand drive,"" she said on the eve of the show. ""You will see an improvement in the future for sure."" 

Fighting spirit: Jaguar is more than bullish about its F-Pace - it needs to sell more cars and the SUV should help it do exactly that 

Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the Frankfurt motor show. Sit tight as we bring you all the news from Europe's biggest automotive showcase. 

First off it's Telegraph Cars editor Steve Huntingford with one of the the biggest stories of the show, the Jaguar F-Pace: 

The big news from Jaguar at the 2015 Frankfurt motor show is the long-awaited reveal of its first SUV, the F-Pace. 

On sale early next year, priced from £34,170, it's quite the looker and will give Jaguar a rival to the Audi Q5 and BMW X3. However, Jaguar Land Rover CEO DR Ralf Speth is quite disparaging of the opposition. 

""They might make millions of cars,"" he said, ""but they are the motoring equivalent of the high street megastores. Our car is for people who want something different. Something special."". Audi's 'Truth in Engineering' brand promise is a cautionary tale. Martin Winterkorn, the CEO of Volkswagen, resigned on Wednesday, in the wake of the widening scandal over faked emissions testing. The company admitted to installing software designed to evade air pollution standards in nearly half a million cars in the U.S. (and potentially 11 million cars worldwide).

One of Volkswagen's brands is Audi, which aired an unfortunately-timed advertisement during the Emmy Awards featuring the tagline, “ Truth in Engineering.”

Audi's ""Truth in Engineering"" ad campaign…. Diesel Cheating Scandal Claiming Top Engineers at VW. At the time of Volkswagen Group CEO Martin Winterkorn’s departure, the company said, “The Executive Committee is expecting further personnel consequences in the next days.” Now we’re getting the first word of who those executives might be. 
 
The German magazine Der Spiegel reports three more heavyweights will be forced out: VW R&D chief Heinz-Jakob Neußer, Audi R&D chief Ulrich Hackenberg, and Porsche R&D chief Wolfgang Hatz. They are supposed to take responsibility for the scandal, which has blown up beyond the wildest imaginations on an international scale. Political outrage has built up and been fanned by reports that the software designed to circumvent U.S. emissions testing was also present on cars sold outside of the U.S. (where, incidentally, it has no effect whatsoever). 
 
The firings have not been officially confirmed yet. 
 
What unites Neußer, Hackenberg, and Hatz is not just their vast knowledge and expertise, and their ability to deep-dive into every technical detail of a car, it is also their love of cars. You could find any of them at races, WRC rallyes, or historical races. Cars were their end, not the means. All three of them had been hand-picked by Ferdinand Piëch and played a major role in making VW the world’s number-one automaker. 
 
Headhunters will scramble to find adequate replacement for the VW Group’s three top engineers, and they might not be able to succeed in this ambitious endeavor. On the other hand, we wouldn’t be surprised if Neußer, Hackenberg, and Hatz were to end up at another carmaker, or a tier-one supplier. 
 
Meanwhile, with the car guys forced out, it’s entirely possible that the bean counters will take over at VW. Sweeeping changes indeed.

www.caranddriver.com. VWs Dieselgate Now Spreads to Audi. Posted Monday, September 28th 2015 @ 9am  by Jenn Gidman,  Newser Staff 
 

 
( NEWSER ) – The dust was just starting to settle on  Volkswagen's emissions-cheating software  on its US diesel vehicles, but new revelations show the hubbub spreading to Audi. The company's luxury brand reported Monday that 2.1 million of its vehicles—including 13,000 in the US—had the same cheat software, reports  CNBC . 
 
Volkswagen's supervisory board handed down suspensions Friday for the R&D heads of its VW, Audi, and Porsche brands until it can figure out who played what role in the deceit, reports  Reuters . Meanwhile, German prosecutors have started investigating  ex-Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn , opening a criminal probe to find out who's to blame and checking for outright fraud, the AP reports—an even more possible scenario as German media reported Monday that a company engineer made cheating allegations back in 2011, CNBC notes.

PHOTO. Audi profile: Age of e-tron. Audi’s international range will grow to 60 variants by 2020, with fully electric and hybrid drivetrains at the forefront of the brand’s product drive, alongside a cluster of dynamic new SUVs. 
 
Manufacturer: Audi AG 
 
Total sales: 2014 1,741,100 
 
Headquarters: Chemnitz, Germany 
 
Global market share: 2.4% 
 
Worldwide availability of the A3 
 
Audi AG achieved an 11% sales uplift year‐on‐year to 1,741,100 units in 2014, exceeding the sales target of 1.7m set out by the Audi 2020 growth plan. The brand’s ever‐popular compact SUV Q model range posted sales increases in all markets to represent 507,500 vehicles, and worldwide availability helped to boost sales of the A3 family by 53% over 2013 levels. Launched in August 2014, but not available in many major markets until this year, the A3 Sportback e‐tron plug‐in hybrid is expected to further broaden the A3’s appeal. 
 
Overall, Audi reported new all time sale highs in 50 countries last year, with deliveries increasing by more than 100,000 units for the fifth year in a row. With 19,238 deliveries, December 2014 was the strongest ever month for Audi sales in the USA. 
 
The Q5 SUV played a significant role in this sales uplift, rising to become the best selling Audi model in the market, while the Q7 also made progress in its ninth year on sale, with a sales increase of 16%. In the compact segment, the Q3 extended Audi’s SUV portfolio in the US in the second half of the year. 
 
Canada (+20%) and Mexico (+11%) also contributed to Audi’s successful year in 
 
North America, with both countries posting double digit growth. Sales in South America increased considerably for Audi AG, above all in Brazil (+90% to 12,350 cars) following the opening of a new manufacturing facility. 
 
In Europe, Audi UK in particular recorded a strong boost in sales, reaching the 
 
150,000 mark for the first time with a 12% uplift to 158,829 sales. Audi also saw strong growth in Spain (+9%); the home market of Germany (+2%) and Italy (+4%). In Russia however, due in large part to the challenging economic and political conditions in the market, deliveries were 6% below 2013’s results. 
 
Orders for the Ultra portfolio (which incorporates Audi’s most efficient technologies and engines for improved fuel consumption and lower emissions), on the A3 accounted for nearly 10% of the brand’s sales in Europe last year. For the A6, the share of Ultra models in Europe was around one third. 
 
Among the major Asian markets, South Korea recorded the strongest growth for Audi, up 38% to 27,647 units in 2014. Thanks to strong demand for the compact models in particular, the brand’s sales figures have increased more than four fold in the market over the past five years. Despite slowing overall market growth, Audi reported a positive sales performance both in Japan and India, with both markets up 9%. 
 
Sales increased by 18% to 578,932 units in China, meaning that Audi became the first premium carmaker to sell over half a million units in China within a single year. 
 
Audi manufactures long‐wheelbase versions of the A8 and A6 specifically for the Chinese market, and the mid‐range SUV models perform well. Premium car sales currently account for around 9% of the total sales in China, compared to between 13% and 15% in mature markets, representing a target market for Audi. 
 
Three new SUVs by 2020 
 
Q1 
 
Arriving next year, the Q1 will be underpinned by the same platform used in the A3 and broaden the A1 family to include a crossover version. The 2016 Q1 will sit at the bottom of the SUV line‐up, and is positioned to rival the Nissan Juke. 
 
The Q1 is expected to offer a range of fuel efficient combustion engines; most likely brought forward from the A1, alongside an electric hybrid e‐tron system. The Crosslane Coupe concept shown at the Paris Motor Show in 2012 also hints at the potential for a fullyelectric drivetrain for the Q1. 
 
Q8 
 
The Q8 – which will take on the Mercedes‐Benz GL‐Class (soon to be renamed GLS) will follow in 2019 and is likely to share its platform with the new Q7. The premium Q8 will top Audi’s SUV range, and is described as being on a par with the A8 in terms of performance and technology features. 
 
The Q8 will extend Audi’s reach at the top of its SUV line‐up, and could prove crucial in markets such as China and the Middle East where sales of premium models are particularly strong. 
 
Electric SUV 
 
There are fewer details about the third SUV, likely to be badged Q6, which Audi says will be a sports‐focused model featuring an electric drivetrain, due in 2018. This could denote a fully-el 
ectric system similar to the forthcoming Tesla   Model X, or possibly a plug‐in hybrid or range‐extender setup – both of which have been displayed in concept cars and production models. 
Audi says the newcomers will set out the foundations for ongoing growth. 
 
The carmaker delivered 591,000 cars in the first four months of the year and, with the new Q7 and A4 arriving during 2015, it expects this to be a record year. 
 
New models and technology 
 
Revealed during the carmaker’s 126th Annual General Meeting in May, Audi’s product expansion strategy will see the range swell to 60 variants by 2020 – assisted by an €24bn investment in facilities, the development of new technologies and increased production capacity. 
 
The new Q7 spearheads this ambitious launch schedule. Lighter by up to 325kg and up to 26% more efficient than its predecessor, the new Q7 is the lightest in its class and brings an all‐new chassis. It is also 37mm shorter and 15mm narrower than the outgoing model, but offers markedly more room inside for passengers and luggage thanks to a clever redesign of the interior. 
 
In Europe, the new Q7 launches with two V6 engines: a TDI and a TFSI. Shortly after launch the Audi Q7 e‐tron quattro will be made available, which is the first plug‐in hybrid from Audi with a diesel engine. A full battery charge is sufficient for a distance of 56km, and prices start at €60,900 for the Q7 3.0 TDI (200 kW). 
 
Also due later this year, the new A4 is built on the latest version of the Volkswagen Group’s MLB platform and despite its larger dimensions; the model’s weight has been reduced significantly – by up to 120kg depending on the engine – thanks to lightweight materials used in its construction. 
 
The new Audi A4 and A4 Avant (due early 2016) will launch with seven engines – three TFSI and four TDI – with fuel economy improved by up to 21% whilst CO2 dips below 100g\/km in the 150hp 2.0 TDI ultra sedan and Avant. A g‐tron version that can use natural gas or the sustainably produced Audi e‐gas as fuel will follow later in markets with the appropriate infrastructure. New technologies include Audi’s Virtual Cockpit all‐digital instrument cluster, wireless on‐board charging for mobile phones and a completely new MMI system with smartphone‐like controls. 
 
Further ahead, Audi has hinted at the technology and design due for its future models with the Prologue concept. Shown as a coupe, Avant and crossover, similar to the carmaker’s allroad vehicles, it features a high‐performance plugin hybrid drivetrain and is similar in size to an A8. The 14.1kWh lithium‐ion battery pack in the rear gives the car a range of 54km in pure electric drive mode. With its AWC (Audi wireless charging) technology which Audi is developing for series production, the battery can also be charged inductively.. VWs Dieselgate Now Spreads to Audi.

PHOTO. UPDATE 4-Volkswagen could face $18 billion penalties from U.S. EPA. (Adds VW campaign to market its ""clean diesel"" cars, EPA comment on possible recall of vehicles, adds DETROIT to dateline) 

					 
WASHINGTON\/DETROIT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG faces penalties up to $18 billion after being accused of designing software for diesel cars that deceives regulators measuring toxic emissions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday. 

					 
""Put simply, these cars contained software that turns off emissions controls when driving normally and turns them on when the car is undergoing an emissions test,"" Cynthia Giles, an enforcement officer at the EPA, told reporters in a teleconference. 

					 
Volkswagen can face civil penalties of $37,500 for each vehicle not in compliance with federal clean air rules. There are 482,000 four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars sold since 2008 involved in the allegations. If each car involved is found to be in noncompliance, the penalty could be $18 billion, an EPA official confirmed on the teleconference. 

					 
A U.S. Volkswagen spokesman said the company ""is cooperating with the investigation; we are unable to comment further at this time."" 

					 
The feature in question, which the EPA called a ""defeat device,"" masks the true emissions only during testing and therefore when the cars are on the road they emit as much as 40 times the level of pollutants allowed under clean air rules meant to ensure public health is protected, Giles said. 

					 
The EPA accused Volkswagen of using software in four-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars from model years 2009 to 2015 made to circumvent emissions testing of certain air pollutants. 

					 
The cars are not facing recall at this time, the EPA said. VW did not indicate on Friday how it will address the issue. 

					 
The EPA has the authority to order VW to recall the vehicles. However, that process could take up to a year, depending on the complexity of the issue, an EPA official said. 

					 
The diesel-powered vehicles involved from the 2009 to 2015 model years are the VW Jetta, VW Beetle, VW Golf and the Audi A3, as well as the VW Passat from model years 2014 and 2015. 

					 
VW in North America has heavily marketed its vehicles as being ""clean diesel."" 

					 
In a television commercial that has aired frequently this year in the United States, VW says it is the ""No. 1 diesel car brand in America,"" brags its cars are ""clean diesel"" and asks viewers, ""Isn't it time for German engineering?"" 

					 
Since 2009, diesel vehicles have made up approximately 15 percent of VW and Audi U.S. sales. 

					 
(Additional reporting by Patrick Rucker in Washington and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Eric Walsh and Matthew Lewis). VW's 'clean diesel' strategy unraveled by outside emissions tests. When the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) commissioned researchers at West Virginia University to test diesel car emissions in 2013, the group expected to find that diesel cars sold in the US emitted fewer pollutants than cars sold elsewhere because they had to meet tougher standards, ICCT officials told Reuters on Monday. 
 
Instead, after testing a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta and a 2013 VW Passat, researchers were “surprised” when the results showed the opposite: the two VW models displayed much higher levels of nitrogen oxide emissions than permitted by law, while a third test vehicle, a BMW X5, generally fell within permissible limits. 
 
“Our hypothesis was these cars would all come out clean,” said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the ICCT, a non-profit independent research group with offices in Washington, San Francisco and Berlin. 
 
In May 2014, ICCT alerted the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board about their findings. On Friday, EPA said VW could be liable for up to $18 billion in penalties for using software on almost 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars that circumvented emissions regulations, unleashing a controversy that threatens long-term damage to VW’s finances, leadership and reputation. 
 
VW shares in Europe fell almost 20 per cent on Monday, and the company suspended US sales of its diesel cars until it can come up with a fix to satisfy regulators. The disclosure comes as VW’s US sales have lagged the company’s performance in other global markets, and could hamper its efforts to boost demand in the American market. 
  “  
Our hypothesis was these cars would all come out clean. 
 
Drew Kodjak, executive director of the ICCT 
  
Industry experts said the scandal could hit VW hard, just as it was emerging from a damaging leadership battle. 
 
VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said on Sunday he was “deeply sorry” for the breach of US rules and ordered an investigation. People including a VW supervisory board member said Winterkorn may have to resign. 
 
The concerns raised by ICCT “prompted CARB to start an investigation and discussions” with VW in 2014, CARB said. Nitrogen oxide emissions have been linked to smog and acid rain. 
 
VW agreed to conduct its own tests to replicate the ICCT study, proposed a software fix to CARB.  
 ‘Clean diesel’  
VW has been airing TV commercials lauding its “clean diesel” cars for several years, including ads that ran last November, even as the company was aware of the emissions controversy. VW on Monday said there was no intention to misinform the public with its clean diesel ads. 
 
In December, VW issued a voluntary recall of all its U.S. diesel cars from model years 2009-2014. 
 
The recall didn’t end the matter. CARB, in cooperation with EPA, said it wanted to do “confirmatory” tests, and it ran those beginning in May 2015. In July, CARB notified VW that the test vehicles still showed emissions that exceeded state and federal limits. California shared those results with federal regulators. 
 
VW attributed the excess emissions to “various technical issues” and “unexpected” real-world conditions. 
 
It wasn’t until EPA and CARB threatened to withhold certification for the automaker’s 2016 diesel models that VW in early September revised its explanation. 
 
“Only then did VW admit it had designed and installed a defeat device in these vehicles in the form of a sophisticated software algorithm that detected when a vehicle was undergoing emissions testing,” the EPA said in its September 18 letter to VW. 
 
The EPA on Friday said that it “intends to compel VW to issue a recall” once the automaker has developed a satisfactory fix. But as of mid-day Monday, company and EPA officials said there was no recall. 
 
VW executives were scheduled to unveil the 2016 Passat - including a “clean diesel” version - in New York City on Monday evening. The company late Monday said the 2016 Passat diesel has not yet been certified for the US by the EPA. . Don’t do testing if you need to hide something. The automotive industry had a fun week with VW getting busted for running software during tests to fake the results of their diesel CO2 emissions. Even the stock prices plummeted around 24% wiping out about $17 billion in shareholder value. 
Apparently around 11 million diesel cars sold globally are outfitted with this software. This could even include Audi and Porsche brands. How the software works basically is that when the vehicle gets hooked up to the test bed the equipment switch over to the “illegal” software. This will then lower the emissions around 40 times. When unhooked, the vehicle will switch to the default software and provide higher performance. 
Now it is probably okay to get mad at the automakers, but this might also have exposed some gaps in the environmental protection agency’s emissions testing practices. The good news is that this woke up regulators worldwide and all automakers might be under eagle eyes to make sure they are not burned again. 
So the lesson this situation bring to light is that if you have something to hide, don’t bother testing. The purpose of testing is to gather information that will provide sufficient data to make an informed risk-based decision if the product is fit for use. (hopefully by an educated individual)  
I think this also brings a little bit of perspective that standards should sometimes also be questioned based on the context of the product or system under test.. South Korea to probe VW, Audi diesel car emissions. The scandal engulfing Volkswagen AG, which has admitted cheating diesel vehicle emissions tests in the US, spread east on Tuesday as South Korea said it would investigate three of the maker’s diesel models.

What's This? 


 
Following the introduction of Audi A3 Carbon Edition just a few days ago, Audi Malaysia is now revealing the enhanced A7 Sportback into our local market. 
 
“Back when the Audi A7 Sportback first debuted in 2010, Audi truly set the bar for automotive design, combining an athletic aesthetic with understated elegance for a car that redefined the boundaries for its segment. With the new A7 Sportback, we took all these exceptional traits and spared no effort in making iteven more exclusive and appealing in terms of design, comfort, performance and fuel efficiency,”  said Immo Buschmann, Managing Director of Audi Malaysia. 
 

 
The revised version of the Audi A7 Sportback features a striking new interpretation of Audi’s Singleframe Grille which when coupled with the car’s long bonnet, short front overhang, muscular waistline, strong orientation towards the rear axle of the car and 19-inch forged aluminium alloy wheels with a 5-spoke V-design thoroughly underline this model’s sporty nature. 
 
Along with Audi’s iconic LED headlights with range adjustment and daytime running lights, as well as LED rear tail lamps with dynamic turn signals, the A7 Sportback certainly looks to leave a lasting impression to onlookers. 
 
The body of the updated Audi A7 Sportback consists primarily of aluminum and high-tech steel grades, making it lightweight yet safe and designed for maximum comfort and insulation from sound\/vibrations. The cargo space under its electrically driven trunk lid has a base capacity of 535-liters, expanding to 1,390-liters once the rear seat backs are folded down. 
 

 
The sporty style of the exterior is carried forth into the car’s interior. The dominant element is the horizontal line surrounding the driver and passenger, which when combined with the dashboard, provides an impression of space and elegance. Additionally, the Aluminum Delta dashboard inlay, Valcona leather seats with electric seat adjustment and ventilation for both front seats, along with the leather-covered sports steering wheel and gear knob ensure that the cabin exudes luxurious refinement. 
 
The new A7 Sportback comes with the latest 3.0 TFSI V6 petrol engine with direct fuel injection generating 333hp and 440Nm of torque. This engine is mated to a 7-speed S tronic transmission and quattro permanent all-wheel drive which allow this coupé to accelerate from 0-100km\/h in 5.3 seconds, approximately 0.3 seconds faster than its predecessor. Despite its exhilarating performance, the Audi A7 Sportback is still highly fuel-efficient, with a combined cycle of 7.6 litres\/100km and a combined CO2 emission rating of 176 g\/km. 
 

 
The new Audi A7 Sportback also leads the competition in terms of infotainment with the MMI navigation plus with MMI touch on an 8-inch LCD colour display boasting the latest generation of the modular infotainment system. Amongst the highlights include a graphics processor from Audi’s partner Nvidia and touchpad control which allows the driver to scroll and zoom into media in a convenient and ergonomic manner.

Audi A7 Sportback. 2016 Audi A4 revealed in Frankfurt. Audi is playing safe with the styling of its upcoming A4, favouring a more conservative look compared with that of the Mercedes C-Class and BMW 3 Series. This is a direct response to feedback from customers in the US, Germany and China, the company’s leading markets. 
 
The new model will be revealed to the public at the Frankfurt motor show this month and will go on sale in the UK from November. Prices will start at £25,900 for the 1.4-litre TFSI. Avant models with the same engine will go on sale from April next year, starting at £27,300. The range-topper will be the Avant 3.0 V6 TDI Quattro, coming in at £40,350 when fitted with an eight-speed tiptronic auto. 
 
While the exterior appears to be little more than a facelift, Audi stresses that much is new. New features include a wider grille, revisions to the headlights and LED daytime running light graphics, a ‘clamshell’ bonnet and bigger wheel-arches. There are also low-set swage lines on each flank. Details such as a significantly flatter undertray, meanwhile, put the Audi at the top of the class when it comes to the drag co-efficient. 
 
 
 
A contemporary new interior now offers a host of upscale options. They include a digital 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, an 8.3-inch monitor, a wireless charging pad for mobiles, sensor control opening of the luggage compartment, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, tablet-based rear seat entertainment and the latest Multi Media Interface (MMI) system with a superfast LTE internet connection. 
 
Another technical highlight is Audi’s pre sense city system, which uses a windscreen camera to monitor the road. If it registers danger, the driver is given an acoustic warning. Full braking can also be deployed at up to 25mph. 
 
In terms of overall dimensions, the Audi is the same height as its predecessor, although it’s 25mm longer (4726mm) and 16mm wider (1842mm). The size increase hasn’t led to any weight gain, however. Audi, in fact, says that it has dropped by around 120kg thanks to measures including lightweight seats and the use of aluminium. 
 
 
 
The figures look good inside, too. Audi says that there is now an extra 24mm of head room and 11mm more in the way of shoulder room in the front. Leg room in the rear is also up by 23mm. 
 
As for boot space, the new A4 Avant, with its 505 litres, now has the edge over the BMW 3 Series Touring and the Mercedes-Benz C-class estate which offer 495 litres and 490 litres respectively. The Avant’s capacity stretches to 1510 litres when the 40\/20\/40 rear seat configuration is folded down. 
 
At launch, the A4 will be offered with a choice of three turbocharged four-cylinder petrol, two four-cylinder diesel and two V6 diesel engines. All will comply with the EU6 emissions standard. Audi claims that they deliver power increases of up to 25 per cent, while also being 21 per cent more economical than their predecessors. 
 
An entry-level 1.4-litre four-cylinder petrol unit develops 148bhp, which is 30bhp more than the 1.8-litre engine it replaces. This gives A4 1.4 TFSI saloon a 0-62mph acceleration figure of 8.9sec and a max speed of 131mph. Combined fuel consumption is 57.7mpg and CO2 emissions are 114g\/km in combination with the optional S tronic dual-clutch auto gearbox. 
 
 
 
The diesel line-up will include Audi’s well known 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit, upgraded with a new AdBlue exhaust injection system, in line with EU6 rules. For the traditionally best-selling A4 2.0 TDI model, 148bhp and 187bhp versions will be available. The former will reach 62mph from a standstill in 8.6sec and reach a 136mph maximum. Its combined fuel consumption is 74.3mpg, and CO2 emissions are 99g\/km in combination with the optional S tronic system. The latter posts a 0-62mph time of 7.7 seconds and goes on to a 147mph top speed. Combined fuel consumption is 68.9mpg; emissions are 107g\/km. 
 
For peak economy, Audi is also offering the A4 2.0 TDI as an Ultra version. In 148bhp saloon format, it’s said to consume just 76.4mpg and emit only 95g\/km. 
 
Front-wheel drive is standard on all models apart from the four-wheel drive A4 3.0 TDI. Additionally, four-wheel drive is an option on the 248bhp A4 2.0 TFSI and the 187bhp A4 2.0 TDI. 
 
Gearbox choices include a new six-speed manual on all four-cylinder engines. The previous Multitronic automatic has been replaced by a revised seven-speed dual-clutch S tronic system. The 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine gets a standard eight-speed automatic with a coasting feature to boost fuel efficiency.. Finance News Update, what you need to know (AAP). WORLD FINANCE UPDATE:

Are you one of the lucky owners of a Volkswagen diesel vehicle who just discovered your car cheats on emissions tests? 

You're in good company: There are about 500,000 of you out there. 

Volkswagen was busted on Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency for cheating on emissions tests. VW diesels (and diesel-powered Audi A3s) have been emitting as much as 40 times the legal amount of dangerous pollutants. 

The car maker was ordered to recall the vehicles and bring them into compliance with emissions rules. 

But what do owners do in the meantime? 

For now, sit tight. Even the EPA said you should continue using your car as you always have. 

Volkswagen installed software that can automatically detect when cars are being tested for emissions. The engine then runs in a way that reduces emissions to legal levels. But when the cars aren't being tested, the engines go back to running ""normally"" and emit far more pollutants. 

It's not clear how VW will address the problem. But it's possible that any change will make cars use more fuel and hurt their performance. 

""It's very likely it will adversely affect fuel economy and performance,"" said Jake Fisher, head of auto testing for Consumer Reports, one of the most influential magazines in America among auto shoppers. 

That's a big deal, since performance and fuel economy are big, big reasons that buyers choose VW diesel vehicles to begin with. Small diesel-powered cars get fuel economy close to that of gasoline-powered hybrids. And, with engines that have plenty of pulling power, they're fun to drive, too. 

After Friday's news, Consumer Reports almost immediately stopped recommending the cars until it has a chance to test them after VW fixes the problem. The affected cars span model years 2009 through 2015. 

It's unclear how VW will get owners to comply with the recall. Many car owners ignore recall notices even when there are serious safety issues involved. In this case, driver's lives aren't at risk so it could be all the more tempting to toss a recall notice in the recycling bin. 

""It might put to test the government's will to forcefully recall cars,"" said Brian Moody, executive editor for AutoTrader.com. 

But this recall might be tough to ignore. States could require proof that the problem has been fixed before allowing cars to be registered or renewed. 

Your car's resale value could depend heavily on getting it into compliance. 

For now, though, little is known how this will play out. Stay tuned.. VWs Dieselgate Now Spreads to Audi. Posted Monday, September 28th 2015 @ 9am  by Jenn Gidman,  Newser Staff 
 

 
( NEWSER ) – The dust was just starting to settle on  Volkswagen's emissions-cheating software  on its US diesel vehicles, but new revelations show the hubbub spreading to Audi. The company's luxury brand reported Monday that 2.1 million of its vehicles—including 13,000 in the US—had the same cheat software, reports  CNBC . 
 
Volkswagen's supervisory board handed down suspensions Friday for the R&D heads of its VW, Audi, and Porsche brands until it can figure out who played what role in the deceit, reports  Reuters . Meanwhile, German prosecutors have started investigating  ex-Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn , opening a criminal probe to find out who's to blame and checking for outright fraud, the AP reports—an even more possible scenario as German media reported Monday that a company engineer made cheating allegations back in 2011, CNBC notes.

PHOTO. Mercedes confirms plans for high-end EV. Daimler is accelerating into the electric future. Last year the company spent about half of its 5-billion-euro R&D budget on electrification and other emission-reducing technologies, and announced that it would introduce 10 new plug-ins by 2017. The Mercedes S550 Plug-In Hybrid, the group’s third model with a cord, went on sale in the US in July . 
 
Now Mercedes has confirmed that it’s working on a pure EV that looks like a possible competitor for Tesla’s Model S. 
 
“We are working on an intelligent concept for a highly attractive electric vehicle with a range of 400-500 km (228-311 miles),” development chief Thomas Weber told the German magazine auto motor und sport , adding that the electric drive concept would fit into Mercedes’s flexible architecture, allowing it to be used in more than one model. 
 
Of course, the media sees every new EV as a would-be Tesla-tamer these days, but the German luxury carmakers, at least, certainly do seem to be targeting Tesla. As Model X’s delivery date approaches, Audi and BMW are both reported to have ESUVs in the pipeline. 
 
Daimler knows more about what goes on in Fremont than most automakers. It partnered with Tesla in 2009, and initially used Tesla powertrains in its smart ED and Mercedes B-class Electric Drive . In 2014, the Germans loosened their ties with Tesla, and started building up a pair of local subsidiaries that build EV batteries and cells. 
 
Source: Automotive News Europe. Audi Says Emissions Scandal Affects 2.1 Million Cars. BERLIN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Audi said 2.1 million cars worldwide were fitted with the software that allowed parent Volkswagen to cheat U.S. emission tests. Some 1.42 million Audi vehicles with so-called EU5 engines are affected in Western Europe, with 577,000 in Germany and almost 13,000 in the United States, a spokesman for Ingolstadt-based Audi said on Monday. Affected model lines include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5, the spokesman said. VW said last week around 11 million cars .... VW and Audi give back Green Car of the Year awards. For the environmental black marks they've received, Volkswagen and Audi have been asked to give up the green. 
 
The two car companies, embroiled in a widening scandal for their part in cheating on auto diesel emissions tests, have lost the prestigious Green Car of the Year Awards they won for their 2009 Jetta TDI and 2010 Audi A3 TDI. 
 
The two “clean” diesel vehicles are included in a batch of 11 million cars worldwide that VW has admitted are fitted with a “defeat device” designed to trick emissions testing. Both vehicles are on the list of cars the Environmental Protection Agency has charged with emitting as much as 40 times the permitted levels of dangerous pollutants. 
 
That batch of cars includes diesels fitted with 4-cylinder engines built by VW, among them 2009 to 2015 VW Jetta, Golf, Passat and Beetle cars, plus the Audi A3. 
 
The awards were taken away by Green Car Journal, whose editor and publisher announced his decision Tuesday night. 
 
“Rescinding the Green Car of the Year awards for the VW Jetta TDI and Audi A3 TDI is unfortunate but appropriate,” said Ron Cogan . 
 
Attempting to make a virtue of a necessity, Audi of America President Scott Keogh said in a statement, “Audi has won hundreds of races and thousands of awards throughout its history. But we only want to win fair and square. Therefore, in light of recent developments, we believe the only right thing to do is to return this important recognition of environmental stewardship.” 
 
Volkswagen of America has also agreed to return its award. 
 
The annual Green Car of the Year award is meant to encourage automakers to continue building vehicles that combine performance, efficiency and low emissions. 
 
Winners for the last several years have been the 2015 BMW i3, 2014 Honda Accord and 2013 Ford Fusion - the latter two for their entire family of gas, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid models.

Volkswagen  ( >> Volkswagen AG ) has suspended the R&D chiefs of its core VW brand, luxury division Audi and sports-car maker Porsche, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
 
The carmaker's supervisory board last Friday agreed to put a number of employees on leave until the details of VW's emissions cheating scandal were cleared up, without providing names. 
 
Reuters reported last Thursday that VW would fire top brand executives as it tries to recover from the scandal. 
 
Audi, VW and Porsche declined comment. 
 
(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Keith Weir). VW Scandal 'An Awful Lot Of Fuss', Says F1 Boss. Speaking to Sky Sports News, Mr Ecclestone said it was ""strange"" that the company had been ""picked on"" for using illegal software to deceive emissions tests. 
 
""I think we're making an awful lot of fuss about this,"" he said. 
 
""When I think about this, and all the trucks that are charging around America - and buses, and generators all running on diesel - and there doesn't seem to be any control over that. 
 
""It's strange that they've sort of picked on somebody that's using a diesel engine in cars."" 
 
The German carmaker admitted last week that it used a special device to fool US emissions testing for its diesel vehicles. 
 
The device is able to detect when cars are undergoing tests, and can switch the vehicle to a low emission mode in order to achieve more favourable results. 
 
Some 11 million Volkswagen diesel cars built since 2008 are affected by the scandal. 
 
Audi, which is a subsidiary of Volkswagen, has also admitted that 2.1 million of its cars were fitted with emission cheating software . 
 
According to an Audi spokesman, around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe are fitted with the device, with 577,000 in Germany. 
 
Another 13,000 Audi cars in the US are affected. 
 
Vehicle lines involved include the Audi A1, A3, A4, A5, A6 and the TT, Q3 and Q5 models. 
 
Reports suggest the research and development chief of Audi, along with those of Volkswagen's core passenger car division and sports car maker Porsche, have been put on leave. 
 
All three companies have declined to comment. 
 
The CEO of the Volkswagen Group,  Martin Winterkorn, was forced to resign over the revelations after almost nine years in the job and was replaced by Matthias Müller, who has been the chief of another Volkswagen subsidiary, Porsche, since 2010. 
 
German investigators subsequently announced they have started an investigation into Winterkorn, which will focus on ""allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data"".

SEOUL\/NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The scandal engulfing
Volkswagen AG, which has admitted cheating diesel
vehicle emissions tests in the United States, spread east on
Tuesday as South Korea said it would investigate three of the
maker's diesel models. 
    
Volkswagen shares plunged by 19 percent on Monday after    
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on
Friday that the world's biggest carmaker by sales used software
that deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions and could
face penalties of up to $18 billion. 
    
Media reports say the U.S. Department of Justice has started
a criminal probe into the allegations, which cover several VW
and Audi-branded diesel models including the Audi A3, VW Jetta,
Beetle, Golf and Passat. 
    
The South Korean probe will involve 4,000 to 5,000 Jetta,
Golf and Audi A3 vehicles produced in 2014 and 2015, Park
Pan-kyu, a deputy director at South Korea's environment
ministry, told Reuters.

The next Insignia will be a global car, and will be sold under the Vauxhall, Opel and Buick badges across Europe, the United States and China.
Caught here undergoing testing in Germany, it is thought that the car is around 12 to 15 months away from making its public debut. The biggest change for what will be the second-generation Insignia is expected to be a small stretch in the car's wheelbase.
The latest spy shots suggest the new Insignia will get an evolutionary look, with only minor styling changes. Among them is a new swooping roofline which is higher at the rear, and a wider rear end.
As well as increasing rear space and making it easier to access the rear cabin (thanks to the taller door apertures), the Mk2 Insignia will get a bigger and more user-friendly boot. A new tailgate design with redesigned taillight clusters should help to ensure that the car has a deeper, wider and taller boot than before, as well as matching the 565-litre capacity of the Skoda Superb.
Under the skin, the Insignia is based on a moderately updated version of GM's familiar Epsilon 2 architecture. In European markets, the most important engine upgrades will be the debut of the new 1.6-litre CDTi diesel in the Insignia, which will replace today's 2.0-litre CDTi unit.
With a newly engineered installation, General Motors will be targeting best-in-class refinement for the diesel Insignias. The new 1.6-litre CDTi engine will be offered in a range of outputs, starting at 136bhp and rising to around 170bhp.
Today's Insignia is already available with GM's new 1.6-litre SIDI turbocharged petrol engine in 168bhp form. This engine will also be offered in two lower-powered versions.
The Insignia will be offered with a new eight-speed automatic transmission, which is expected to improve overall fuel economy by around 3% compared with the six-speed manual versions.

New 450bhp Lotus 3-Eleven completes Nürburgring testing Posted: 10 Sep 2015 04:17 AM PDT New Lotus 3-Eleven will have more than 500bhp per tonne and cost from £82k when it arrives next year The Lotus 3-Eleven has completed its two-week testing session at the Nürburgring ahead of a planned launch in February of next year.
The 450bhp, sub-900kg car is the fastest and most expensive model Lotus has built and was first revealed at the Goodwood Festival of Speed earlier this summer.
Lotus says the 3-Eleven covered over 1200 miles as part of its test session, with a fastest time of 7min06sec being recorded. That time was calculated from adding together the fastest sector times from two separate laps of the course, which Lotus did not have to itself.
Lotus test driver Marc Basseng said that with the track to itself, the 3-Eleven could be able to break the sub-7min lap time barrier.
Initially, Lotus CEO Jean-Marc Gales was confident that his car would be ""not far away"" from the sub-7min time posted by Porsche's £1 million 918 Spyder, saying: ""The 3-Eleven condenses our engineering know-how into a hardcore package that won't suit everyone. But it is a perfect demonstration of the concept crucial to all future Lotus cars.""
The car will come in two versions - Road and Race - costing between £82,000 and £115,200, depending on specification.
Gales has called the 3-Eleven ""an uncompromised manifestation of the Lotus idiom"" that delivers ""legendary handling and blistering speed"". In Race form, it recently lapped Lotus's Hethel circuit in just 1min 22sec, fully 10sec faster than the next-quickest Lotus.
Straight-line performance is just as electrifying. The Race version can cover 0-60mph in less than 3.0sec, which pitches it straight into McLaren P1 and LaFerrari territory. Flat out, the 3-Eleven can top 174mph in Race trim, and the Road model, on a slightly taller gearing, can do 180mph.
The engine is a transverse, midmounted version of Lotus's 3.5-litre Toyota-sourced V6, with the supercharger, integrated charge cooler and engine management electronics designed at Hethel. Power is 450bhp at 7000rpm, and maximum torque is 332lb ft at 3500rpm.
The road-going 3-Eleven gets a conventional six-speed H-pattern gearbox (with racing clutch) and the Race version has an Xtrac sequential six-speed paddleshift 'box. Both have Torsentype limited-slip differentials.
The car has a bonded and riveted aluminium monocoque tub chassis reminiscent of other Lotus models' but ""massively strengthened"" for this new application. The Road model's rollcage incorporates extra side impact bars, and the Race cage has additional bars to meet FIA international race regulations.
The 3-Eleven's dramatic silhouette is formed in a new composite material 40% lighter than standard glassfibre, its first application in a production car. Designed in-house at Lotus, the car has all the cooling scoops and exit vents a powerful car needs while keeping aerodynamic drag and frontal area low.
The car's profile is dominated by an ""aerodynamically significant"" roll-over bar cover and there are different front splitter and rear spoiler designs for Road and Race models. In Race trim, the aero package delivers about 215kg of downforce at 150mph.
The cockpit treatment is minimalistic. There's an aero screen, the instrument pack is designed around a single TFT screen, and the driver's seat is a lightweight Lotus-designed bucket. A quick-release steering wheel and four-point harness are both standard.
Road car owners have the option of a tonneau panel covering the passenger's side, or can remove it and fit an optional passenger's seat.
Both the Race and Road models get an all-independent suspension with lightweight coil-sprung double wishbones, special Ohlins dampers and adjustable front anti-roll bars. Both models ride on lightweight forged alloy wheels (18in front, 19in rear) and wear either Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres (Road) or Michelin Cup 2s (Race). Both also get two-piece cross-drilled and vented disc brakes with AP Racing four-piston callipers.
Anticipating strong worldwide demand for the 3-Eleven and the recently announced Evora 400, Lotus is splitting its Hethel production onto two lines, Evora and The Rest, and ramping up production to 70 cars a week by this September from the current 45.
The company expects to take about two years to build the planned batch of 311 cars, selling them both through dealers and from its Racing department. Deliveries will begin next April.
Meet the ancestors
Lotus's new 3-Eleven picks up a race-car-for-the-road tradition established by founder Colin Chapman as long ago as 1956 with the original, ultra-lightweight Lotus Eleven, which had a super-aerodynamic aluminium body over a steel spaceframe chassis.
It was sold as a road car, but on the track it perfectly embodied Colin Chapman's ""just add lightness"" philosophy with a kerb weight of just over 400kg when powered by an 1100cc Climax engine, and it scored impressive class wins at places like Le Mans and Sebring.
Half a century later, in 2007, Lotus launched the doorless, open cockpit 2-Eleven, employing much the same philosophy, with Elise running gear as its basis. The car was nominally available with a tuned version of the Elise's 1.8-litre Toyota-derived four-cylinder engine, but most buyers opted for the 252bhp version, with supercharging engineered at Hethel, which delivered a 0-60mph time well under 4.0sec plus a 150mph top speed.
However, today's 3-Eleven, with 20% more weight but 80% more power, promotes the car to a new class.

New battery for Nissan Leaf to deliver 155-mile range Posted: 10 Sep 2015 04:00 AM PDT The 30kW option will go on sale in December with an increased eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty, priced from £24,490 A new 30kW battery in the Nissan Leaf will go on sale in December, delivering a claimed range of 155 miles. It will go on sale alongside the 24kW unit but will only be available in Acenta and Tekna trim, priced from £24,490 to £27,940 including the UK government's £5000 Plug-in grant, which was recently extended until February 2016. Nissan is also increasing its warranty for the 30kW unit to an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty. The new battery brings an increase in range of around 25% over the alternative 24kW unit, according to Nissan. It has the same dimensions as the lesser-powered unit but is 21kg heavier. The manufacturer says this longer range is the result of the introduction of carbon, nitrogen and magnesium to the electrodes in the new unit. Nissan expects the real-world range of the new battery to be around 12-15% less than the claimed 155 miles, representing a similar loss to the 24kW unit. This would put the new battery's real-world range at around the 135-mile mark. In Acenta and Tekna trims, the 30kW Leaf comes with a 7.0in touchscreen and the smartphone-compatible Nissan Connect EV infotainment system, which allows users to check the charge status of the car and remotely control features such as the air-con. The system the previous Car Wings set-up. The new infotainment package includes a charging map that can show which charging points are available and which are being used. It also delivers maintainance alerts and a car-finder facility. Exterior alterations are minimal and include a new roof-mounted aerial as well as the choice of a new bronze colour. ""It's a game changer for Nissan,"" said EV director for Europe Jean-Pierre Diernaz. ""This increased range will have an impact on the perception of our electric vehicles and will open it up to a wider market."" Diernaz also added that the Leaf range could expand in the future to new electric models. ""It's possible,"" he said. ""We will take this technology, improve it, and we are looking at putting it wherever it is relevant for us as a line-up expansion, and where it is releveant for a consumer. ""This new battery is just the beginning of something bigger,"" he added. ""The next milestone is a range of over 180 miles."" Earlier this year Nissan expanded the Leaf trim range with a new Acenta+ version, sitting between Acenta and range-topping Tekna priced at £24,740 including the plug-in grant.

Enter your email address below: Facelifted Alfa Romeo Mito to launch in 2016 Posted: 10 Sep 2015 03:44 AM PDT Facelifted Mito will go head to head with Audi's A1 and Volkswagen's Polo in Europe A refreshed Alfa Romeo Mito, which is expected to launch in 2016, has been seen testing on Italian roads for the first time.
The camouflaged car appears to be a facelift of the current model rather than an all-new car.
The updated version is likely to arrive with a new honeycombe front grill replacing the existing horizontal chrome bars. Minor changes to the front and rear light clusters and bumpers are also likely, all of which are aimed at bringing the Mito into line with Alfa's new Giulia.
The Mito was launched in 2008 as a replacement for the 149. In late 2013 the Mito underwent its first minor facelift. At the time a simplified range was introduced along with a new economical 0.9-litre turbo Twinair engine and upgraded materials.
As with the previous facelift, Alfa Romeo is likely to use this as an opportunity to introduce further upgrades on the Mito as well as an improved range of engines.
The current Mito, which counts the Audi A1 and Volkswagen Polo among its rivals, is priced between £14,335 and £18,135. A small price increase is expected for the facelifted version.

Honda Civic Tourer Active Life concept unveiled Posted: 10 Sep 2015 03:23 AM PDT Active Life concept showcases Civic Tourer's practicality by providing space and accessories for keen cyclists Honda will present a new concept car based on the Civic Tourer at the Frankfurt motor show next week.
The concept, dubbed the Civic Tourer Active Life, comes with features designed to help cyclists, including an extendable loading rack which has space for two bicycles. The bikes can then be retracted into the 1668-litre boot space.
The car also features an integrated air pump, extra lighting, a shaded canopy with retractable bench and space for toolboxes and water bottles. The Active Life also comes with its own water tank and front wheel holder.
A special roof box also provides additional storage space.
Honda says the concept is finished in bespoke blue paintwork and sits on new 18in alloy wheels. Blue trim and stitching also features inside.
Power for the concept comes from Honda's 1.6-litre i-DTEC diesel engine, which recently set a Guinness World Record for efficiency, returning 100.31mpg over a route of over 8000 miles across 24 countries.

2017 Vauxhall Meriva replacement spotted - first spy pictures Posted: 10 Sep 2015 03:00 AM PDT Replacement for the current Meriva will morph into a crossover as Vauxhall looks to capitalise on the growing demand for such vehicles across Europe The replacement for the Vauxhall Meriva has been caught testing ahead of next year's launch, with these first spy pictures revealing that the new car will take on a crossover shape rather than that of a traditional MPV.
The new model - which is likely drop the Meriva name - is expected to be revealed towards the end of 2016 ahead of first deliveries taking place in early 2017. It's the first car to come from Vauxhall's partnership with PSA Peugeot Citroën, announced in 2012, and will result in new models for both French manufacturers in the near future.
Sales of traditional MPVs continue to fall across Europe and Vauxhall appears to have taken the strategic decision to morph its entry-level MPV into a fresh new crossover.
A similar move was taken by Renault last year, with the revitalised Espace taking on a more SUV-like shape rather than keeping its MPV proportions. Such a move has allowed Renault to capitalise on the growing demand for small SUVs and crossovers in Europe.
The new Meriva is likely to benefit from shared engines with the Corsa and Astra. Although development is still in the early stages, Vauxhall is also deciding whether to use PSA engines to power the Meriva as well as its own units.
Vauxhall is likely to raise significantly the perceived quality of the cabin, with improvements to fit and finish, as it has in the new Corsa and Astra. The IntelliLink infotainment system is expected to be transferred from the Corsa and Astra, and is likely to be standard on all but entry-level models. It features a 7.0in colour touchscreen located on the centre console between the driver and front passenger.
The Meriva won't be the only new entrant into this growing market for long, as Ford is expected to launch two new crossovers based on the Fiesta and Focus by 2016. Ford and Vauxhall will then take the fight for sales to Dacia, Fiat and Nissan, all of which are already established in the small crossover sector with the Duster, 500X and Juke respectively.

Radical Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport arriving in 2016 Posted: 10 Sep 2015 02:55 AM PDT Volkswagen's 261bhp Golf GTI Clubsport will go on sale in the UK early next year following its debut in Frankfurt next week The most powerful production Volkswagen Golf GTI ever made, the Clubsport, will go on sale in the UK early next year, following its debut at the Frankfurt motor show next week.
Set to go on sale at a price of around £27,500, the celebratory Golf GTI has been created to mark the 40th anniversary of the introduction of Wolfburg's iconic front-wheel-drive hot hatch, which hit showrooms back in 1976. It was first unveiled in concept form at the annual Wörthesee fan meet in Austria earlier this year.
As with each of the previous four anniversary models produced by Volkswagen, the Clubsport receives a more powerful engine than standard existing versions of the Golf GTI as well as retuned suspension, a series of exterior styling changes and various interior upgrades. 
Differentiating the new Clubsport concept from existing versions of the Golf GTI is an aggressive new bodykit that is described as being virtually identical to that set to grace next year's 40th anniversary model.
Included is a uniquely styled front bumper featuring a large central air duct with a honeycomb insert, additional trapezoidal ducts used to cool the front brakes, prominent high gloss black blades low down on the outer edges and a subtle splitter.
These exterior upgrades are accompanied by high gloss black door mirror housings and a black graphic along the lower edge of the doors in homage to the look of the original Golf GTI. At the rear, Volkswagen's design team has provided the new car with a new spoiler mounted atop the tailgate together with a heavily restyled bumper with an integrated diffuser and twin chromed tailpipes.
Also new are the Golf GTI Clubsport's wheels, which are 18-inch units as standard but can be optioned up to 19-inches.
The Golf GTI Clubsport is powered by version of the Volkswagen Group's turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder EA888 petrol engine, as used by existing versions of Wolfsburg's iconic hot hatchback.
But while the standard Golf GTI comes with 217bhp as standard or 227bhp in combination with an optional performance package, the Clubsport will offer 261bhp, making it the most powerful production Golf GTI yet made. A function that temporarily increases turbocharger boost pressure adds a further 10% to the overall output for short bursts of full-throttle action, raising overall reserves to 287bhp.
Volkswagen is yet to reveal a torque figure, although insiders at the company's Braunschweig research and development centre in Germany suggest it remains at the same level as that of existing Golf GTIs, with 258lb ft developed across a band of revs between 1500 and 4400rpm.
Channelling drive to the front wheels is a six-speed dual-clutch automatic DSG gearbox and electronically controlled XDS differential, though a six-speed manual is also available.
Volkswagen says the Clubsport is capable of reaching 62mph in 6.0 seconds, and can return up to 42.1mpg - equivalent to 155g\/km of CO2.

Ford reveals three-year plan to sell more SUVs Posted: 10 Sep 2015 02:19 AM PDT Five new crossover vehicles spearhead Ford's plan to expand market share in the next three years Five new all-wheel-drive vehicles form Ford's plan to expand market share in the next three years
Ford has announced plans to launch five all-new or redesigned SUV and crossover vehicles across Europe in the next three years.
The drive to increase Ford's SUV sales by 200% by the end of 2016 starts with the arrival of updated versions of the mid-size Kuga and EcoSport compact SUV, both due by the end of the year. 
The new Kuga will see the introduction of new colour options and an enhanced multimedia system. The new multimedia system, SYNC 2, has an 8in touchscreen that controls the climate settings, sat-nav functions and Bluetooth. The system features voice activation.
The Ecosport facelift loses its rear mounted spare wheel in favour of a tyre mobility kit, and the updated car will offer improved refinement, performance and sharper driving dynamics.
Early 2016 will see the introduction of the firm's large SUV, the Ford Edge. It will make its debut at the Frankfurt motor show next week. The Edge will also be offered in the UK for the first time.
Two crossovers are then expected to join the range, based on the Fiesta and Focus.
The ambitious targets will see all-wheel-drive vehicles account for 50% of all Fords sold by 2016, when the option will be available on the Mondeo, S-Max, Transit and Galaxy models too. The new Focus RS was released with the new Ford Performance AWD with dynamic torque vectoring earlier this year, and the Ranger pick-up is currently offered with driver-selectable 4WD.
A Ford-sponsored survey in Europe indicates that the SUV sales boom is set to accelerate, with a drive from buyers aged between 17 and 34.

Next Mercedes-Benz E-Class to get luxury Maybach version Posted: 10 Sep 2015 12:00 AM PDT Mercedes-Benz will expand its resurrected Maybach sub-brand with a super-luxury version of the upcoming E-Class Mercedes-Benz is set to expand its newly formed Maybach sub-brand line-up to include a plush new extended-wheelbase version of the upcoming fifth-generation E-Class.
The new range-topping E-Class, caught here testing in prototype form ahead of a likely unveiling at next year's Beijing motor show in China, is set to form part of a three-model Mercedes-Maybach line-up alongside the recently introduced extended-wheelbase S-Class and a luxurious new Range-Rover-rivalling GLS Maybach due for launch next year.
Autocar understands the new E-Class Maybach is set to be powered by a 417bhp version of the AMG-developed twin-turbo 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine, as recently launched in the facelifted G500. Other ppowertrain options are also planned, including a petrol-electric plug-in hybrid set-up offering a zero-emissions range of up to 31 miles, according to sources at the German car maker.
Sporting a significantly longer wheelbase than the standard new E-Class, the model will be offered with individual rear seats similar to those in the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class.
Mercedes-Benz has traditionally produced a long-wheelbase version of the E-Class, although up to now it has been sold exclusively in China, where it is produced at Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler's joint venture partner, Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation (BAIC).
The existing E400 L Hybrid, built by BAIC, has a 140mm longer wheelbase than standard E-Class models at 3015mm - or just 20mm shorter than that of the standard S-Class.

Throwback Thursday - The birth of modern Audi, 10 September 1965 Posted: 09 Sep 2015 04:01 PM PDT Following an absence of 25 years, the Audi name returned to motoring in 1966 with the launch of a new family saloon During the mid-1960s, ownership of the Auto Union brand gradually shifted from Daimler to Volkswagen, which bought up shares and invested heavily in the Auto Union factory in Ingolstadt.
That plant was producing three-cylinder, two-stroke DKW models, but Volkswagen adopted a plan already put in place by Daimler to create a new family saloon around a 1696cc four-cylinder, four-stroke engine.
Although the saloon used most of the same underpinnings as DKW's F102, VW wanted to tell the world that this was essentially a new car.
So Wolfsburg looked to the other manufacturer names that had originally comprised Auto Union, namely Audi, Horch and Wanderer. With Horch retained by Daimler and the Wanderer name presumably deemed not exactly ripe for revival, the new car was christened the Auto Union Audi, with 'Audi' as a model name rather than a make.
Autocar investigated the new car ahead of its 1966 debut. ""Like the original Audi models and, of course, DKW ones as well, the new car features front-wheel drive with an all-synchromesh four-speed gearbox and inboard disc brakes  at the front,"" said Autocar. ""The new engine has been designed and  developed by Mercedes-Benz, tested  and approved by Volkswagen and will  be built by Auto Union.""
Setting a template for future Audis, the engine was ""inclined at 40deg and mounted in front of the driven front wheels. A longer nose – the car has an front overhang of 872mm – overcomes the problem of fitting the engine in the front compartment.
""To keep the bonnet line low and particularly the centre of gravity, the engine is canted over at 40deg so that the induction side is on top.""
Intent on giving the Audi a better ride quality than its DKW sibling, Volkswagen focused on developing the suspension. ""Double wishbones at the front are sprung by adjustable longitudinal torsion bars, and the telescopic dampers incorporate progressive rubber bump stops.
""Three reasons are given for the inboard brakes: they give less unsprung weight, to improve the suspension; they are not restricted in diameter by the wheel rim size; and there is a direct flow of cooling air through this part of the engine compartment.""
With its new, longer engine, the Audi was about four inches longer than the DKW F102, but otherwise the dimensions were much the same. There were rectangular headlamps and no mesh in the grille, just a surround and the four Auto Union linked rings, one for each of the original four companies.
""The body shell has a flat floor, since there is no propeller shaft, and there is room for five people,"" said Autocar. ""As the gearchange lever is on the steering column, there would be room for an additional front-seat passenger if separate seats were not fitted.""
After a 25-year absence, the Audi name was back, and its arrival was well timed. Sales of two-strokes were falling and the DKW brand associated with such units was phased out as the new Auto Union became available in 1966.

New Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer revealed ahead of Frankfurt motor show Posted: 09 Sep 2015 04:01 PM PDT More space but less weight in estate version of the latest Astra Vauxhall is promising more interior space but improved efficiency and reduced weight with its new Astra Sports Tourer, which has been revealed ahead of its debut at the Frankfurt motor show.
The estate version of the five-door Astra has the same basic dimensions as the model it replaces, with an overall length of 4702mm and a width of 1871mm. But Vauxhall claims that tweaks to the interior packaging have freed up an additional 26mm of front headroom, 28mm more rear headroom and an extra 80 litres of luggage space. With the rear seats folded down, the Sports Tourer now has a capacity of 1630 litres.
The Astra wagon's load bay gets a 40\/20\/40 split rear seat as standard and it can be enhanced further by optional products from the FlexOrganiser range, including side rails, fasteners and cargo nets. The rear hatch can also be electrically operated and, as an option, opened and closed by waving a foot below the rear bumper.
As with the conventional Astra hatchback, the Sports Tourer makes significant weight gains - up to 200kg, in the case of the estate - thanks to a switch to General Motors' latest D2 platform.
Engine power outputs will start at 99bhp and go up to the 198bhp 1.6-litre petrol that's also making its world debut at Frankfurt. Other notable units will be a new 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol motor with 148bhp and Vauxhall's latest 1.6-litre Whisper Diesel.
Much of the cabin trim and fascia design is carried over from the recently launched Astra - including Vauxhall's OnStar connectivity package and an infotainment system that offers Apple's CarPlay and Android Auto.
The Astra Sports Tourer is due on sale in October. Prices are likely to stay broadly in line with the outgoing model's, with a starting figure of around £17,000.

2015 Audi A4 1.4 TSI 150 Sport review Posted: 09 Sep 2015 09:00 AM PDT The A4 1.4 TSI, which replaces the old 1.8 TSI model, is the cheapest way to own Audi's new compact exec saloon. Is it still worthy of the premium badge? The 1.4 TFSI is the entry-level model of the ground-up new Audi A4 range. It's based on Audi's new MLB-Evo platform and is claimed to weigh as much as 120kg less than the outgoing model. The drag coefficient of 0.23 is said to be lowest in class.The car has grown in size, being 25mm longer (12mm of the stretch is in the wheelbase) and 16mm wider. This is to the benefit of cabin space, especially in the rear. Knee room is particularly impressive for rear passengers, while the front seat occupants have a satisfyingly capacious cockpit. This 'totally new' 148bhp petrol engine replaces the old 1.8 TFSI unit, although it is less powerful. It's a sophisticated unit, which has its exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, very high-pressure (200bar) fuel injection and separate cooling circuits for the crankcase and cylinder head. The engine is mated to a six-speed manual gearbox. Unfortunately the 1.4 TSI isn't offered with Audi's new automatic seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. The entry-level A4 1.4 TFSI SE model costs £25,900 on the road. Notable standard-issue features include xenon headlights with LED running lights, three-zone climate control, switchable damping, automatic city braking, keyless go, stop-start and cruise control with a 'freewheeling' mode.In the UK, pay another £950 for this Sport model and you'll also get sat-nav, 17in wheels, extendable squab sports seats, an upgraded sound system and a nice three-spoke steering wheel. Lamborghini Huracán Spyder LP610-4 confirmed for Frankfurt debut Posted: 09 Sep 2015 02:44 AM PDT Open-top version of the Lamborghini Huracán is likely to go on sale soon after its Frankfurt debut Lamborghini has confirmed it will introduce a Spyder variant of the Huracán at the Frankfurt motor show next week.
The new car is expected to keep the coupé's 5.2-litre naturally aspirated V10 engine, which produces 602bhp and 413lb ft in the coupé.
While official performance figures won't be revealed until the car's official launch, it's expected to closely match the regular Huracán's 0-62mph sprint time of 3.2sec and its 202mph top speed.
Like the Gallardo Spyder, the open-top Huracán is expected to use a folding soft-top roof to save weight.
The new Huracán Spyder will replace the ageing Gallardo Spyder in Lamborghini's line-up and was first confirmed to Autocar at the Pebble Beach Concours event last year.
Speaking at the event, Lamborghini boss Stefan Winklemann said more derivatives of the Huracán could be offered in the future. ""We need lots of derivatives,"" he said ""Customers expect it and we always need something new to talk about.""

EPA accuses VW of cheating on emission rules. Diesel cars from Volkswagen and Audi cheated on clean air rules by including software that made the cars' emissions look cleaner than they actually were, according to federal and California regulators. 
 
The regulators say that the software on the cars turns up emission controls only when it detects that the car was being tested. 

""The effectiveness of these vehicles' pollution emissions control devices is greatly reduced during all normal driving situations,"" said the Environmental Protection Agency's notice to the company. ""This results in cars that meet emissions standards in the laboratory or testing station, but during normal operation, emit nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the standard."" 

There are nearly 500,000 of these diesel cars on U.S. roads. The models include the VW Jetta, the Beetle and the Golf from model years 2009 through 2015, the Passat from 2014-2015 as well as the Audi A3, model years 2009-2015. The Audi luxury brand is owned by Volkswagen Group. 

Owners of the affected cars do not face health risks, according to the EPA, and can to continue to drive or sell them. But the EPA has ordered VW to recall the cars and fix the violation. No recall has yet been announced. 

Representatives from EPA and the California Air Resources Board, which did the testing that uncovered the problem, would not say whether a change to the software would have a negative impact on the cars' performance or the fuel economy. 

Volkwagen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The EPA did not say how much VW would ultimately be fined for this infraction. 

Diesel cars get much better fuel economy than gasoline powered cars.. EPA says VW intentionally violates clean air standards. WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday ordered Volkswagen to fix nearly 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars that the agency said are intentionally violating clean air laws by using software that evades EPA emissions standards. 
 
VW, which owns Audi, faces billions of dollars in fines, although exact amounts were not determined. 
 
The cars, all built in the last seven years, include a device programmed to detect when they are undergoing official emissions testing, the EPA said, adding that the cars only turn on full emissions control systems during that testing. The controls are turned off during normal driving situations, the EPA said. 
 
The EPA called the company's use of the device illegal and a threat to public health. 
 
The EPA called on VW to fix the cars' emissions systems, but said car owners do not need to take any immediate action. The violations do not present a safety hazard and the cars remain legal to drive and sell, the EPA said. 
 
The German automaker said in a statement it is cooperating with the investigation, but declined further comment. 
 
The EPA said VW faces fines of up to $37,500 per vehicle for the violations — a total of more than $18 billion. No final total was announced. 
 
Despite the seriousness of the violation, the EPA said VW will be given ""a reasonable amount of time to develop a plan to complete the repairs,"" including both the repair procedure and manufacture of any needed parts. 
 
It could take up to a year to identify corrective actions, develop a recall plan and issue recall notices, the EPA said. 
 
The allegations cover roughly 482,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the United States since 2008. Affected models include: 
 
. Jetta (Model Years 2009 - 2015) 
 
. Beetle (Model Years 2009 - 2015) 
 
. Audi A3 (Model Years 2009 - 2015)

Placed between the Q5 and Q7, the Q6 concept “provides an outlook on the brand’s first large series electric car”. 
 
The e-tron quattro is based on Audi’s MLB platform as found in the latest Q7, while it has a similar powertrain to the latest R8 e-tron. But the Q6 will have an electric motor in the gearbox and two in the rear axle, each one driving a rear wheel (the R8 e-tron has two motors). 
 
The e-tron quattro SUV is intended to have more power than the R8 e-tron. With 500bhp and 516lb ft, it will have nearly 50bhp more than the R8 version. The power will be drawn from a lithium-ion battery set low down in the chassis, for a low centre of gravity. Audi claim this will improve the driving response to place it above any other vehicle in the segment. The battery is intended to have a range of over 300 miles and may produce 90kWh. 
 
The chassis is a mixture of hot-formed steel, aluminium and carbonfibre-reinforced plastic. It is not yet known if Audi will use steel springs or an air-sprung arrangement. 
 
The interior will be on a par with the next generation A8 luxury saloon, so it should have the latest infotainment and features. Audi say they aim to make driving this zero-emission vehicle “a pleasure not a compromise”.

PHOTO. Audi Australia explains #dieselgate to its owners…. Audi is now caught up in the same #dieselgate storm as the VW Group, and Audi Australia is trying to clear the air with owners. 
SUCH IS THE IMPORTANCE OF the Volkswagen Group emissions scandal, Audi Australia MD Andrew Doyle had to withdraw from the launch of the new RS3 Sportback held in Tasmania this week. 

Audi Australia PR Anna Burgdorf read a prepared statement about the current situation as it is understood by Audi Australia, but declined to release a written statement. 

Here, verbatim and probably exclusively, is what she said. 

“As you all know, it has been a fairly busy time for the Volkswagen Group and all of our brands as a result of the news generated by the US EPA and the CARB investigations into the Volkswagen Group test recognition software in the last week and a half. Andrew (Doyle) is working in our Sydney office to clarify our situation in Australia and to brief the government on our investigations to date. I wanted to take the opportunity to bring you up to date on the current situation but please be aware we are not issuing this as a statement to any other media. 

“As you know, the Volkswagen Group has confirmed that the test recognition software that was detected by the US EPA exists only in the Group engine designated EA189 which other Group brands, including Audi, also use. It has been confirmed by Audi that 2.1 million vehicles worldwide use this engine, of which 2 million are in Europe and therefore may contain the software. The Group has advised that no petrol engines are affected, and nor are any EU6 TDI models, as well as EU5 and EU6 V6 TDI and V8 TDI models. This also applies to the new A4 B9 in Europe which is currently being delivered to European dealers and is equipped with a fully EU6-compliant engine range. 

“Potentially affected Audi models include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 either with an EU5 1.6-litre TDI (and that refers to A1 and A3) or 2.0-litre TDI engine. 

“Audi Australia is working as quickly as we can, together with our head office, to analyse the potential effect on Australian-delivered vehicles and to inform the Australian government of our investigations to date. We hope to provide that information in the next few days. Please understand that the investigations are ongoing. We don’t yet know the full effect of the software on Australia-delivered vehicles. However, it is our understanding that the software is inactive in all Australian Audi vehicles with an EA189 engine. 

“Our customers are our highest priority at this time and we will be contacting them directly once we have a list of potentially affected vehicles, along with an understanding of any possible software effects. At that time we will confirm our next steps to remove the software from customer vehicles. In the meantime, we are encouraging all Audi owners who may have concerns to contact our customer service line with any questions and we have increased staff levels at our customer service centre to respond to all customer queries. Until we have more accurate information and have been able to brief the Australian government, unfortunately we can’t comment any further on the topic. 

“We will be more than happy to provide contact details of a media spokesperson at Audi A.G. who may be able to answer more questions, particularly in regard to any technical topics. Thank you for your understanding.” 

Volkswagen US has launched a consumer-oriented website that explains what models are affected, and much more. Visit it HERE .. AUDI : ENVIRONMENT: When VW cheated on emissions, it cheated on health. Sept. 29 --Related: CASSIE MAcDUFF: VW smokescreen reaches all the way to Inland Empire 
 
--- 
 
Already, Volkswagen Group is on the hook for what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says could be more than $18 billion in civil penalties for violating the U.S. Clean Air Act with its emissions scam. 
 
Additionally, the German automaker will be forced to pay for the repair of 482,000 affected diesel vehicles it sold in the U.S. between 2009 and 2015. And the company will need to defend itself in court from dozens of lawsuits related to the company's use of so-called defeat device software that engages cars' pollution controls only when they are emissions-tested. 
 
Then there are the health consequences. 
 
The engines that VW tweaked to run quickly and efficiently also spewed out a form of pollutant that, over time and in big numbers, can be lethal. 
 
Nearly half a million Volkswagens each generated up to 40 times the federal limit of nitrogen oxides, or NOx, pollutants that can be particularly harmful for children, the elderly, and people with asthma and certain heart conditions. 
 
""NOx is the critical pollutant that needs to be reduced to meet health-based clean air standards,"" said Sam Atwood , spokesman for the Southern California Air Quality Management District in Diamond Bar , the agency charged with protecting public health from air pollution in much of the region. 
 
Based on academic research about the health effects of nitrogen oxides, numbers of vehicles on the road and the miles driven, the affected cars may have killed dozens of people in California and more than 100 nationally. Who those people were, individually, can never be known. 
 
That estimate works like this: A 2005 study from researchers at Princeton , Harvard Medical School and the National Bureau of Economic Research , among others, found that each ton of nitrogen oxides emitted into the atmosphere resulted in up to nearly 1 in 10,000 additional deaths. 
 
While estimates vary on how much additional pollution was generated by VW and Audi vehicles over the past six years, the number of cars sold over the six-year period and the average number of miles driven are known. 
 
In all, this year it's possible the 482,000 affected vehicles together could log 6.5 billion miles, generating between half a ton and 2 tons of excess nitrogen oxide emissions. Though those numbers would have been lower in earlier years, health experts believe the output contributed to a variety of health problems, including premature death. 
 
While the emissions of individual vehicles do not create health effects, they do collectively, according to Janet McCabe , acting assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation . 
 
The emissions standards established by the Clean Air Act, and violated by Volkswagen, exist to protect public health, McCabe said this month. 
 
Other experts point out that diesel engines have posed particular health risks. 
 
""Diesel engines in and of themselves are known to have much higher emission rates of NOx and very small particles, and that's part of the reason why they have very sophisticated emissions control systems,"" said Ed Avol , professor of clinical medicine in the department of preventive medicine at USC's Keck School of Medicine . 
 
""The reason it's important from a health standpoint is that drivers and the general population were being exposed to higher levels of NOx when they were out using their vehicles. That's a problem,"" added Avol, an expert in respiratory health and air pollution who has spent decades studying traffic's effects on public health. 
 
While the number of super-polluting VW and Audi diesel passenger vehicles is relatively small compared with the 26 million registered cars, SUVs, pickup trucks and vans in California , Avol said ""if you're on the freeway, behind a diesel,"" it can be unhealthy. 
 
Those most affected by a vehicle spewing such elevated levels of nitrogen oxides would be traveling immediately behind or beside it. 
 
""That's the air that's being drawn into the personal passenger compartment, coming from in front of you into the car,"" Avol said. ""Incrementally, it's a small effect. But in absolute relative terms, you're getting more of a dose and more exposure."" 
 
How that exposure affects one individual vs. another depends on a variety of factors, Avol said, including genetics, previous exposure, age and overall health. 
 
""In general if you're getting 10 to 30 or 40 times more exposure, it's not a good thing,"" he added. 
 
Nitrogen oxide exposure can be separated into the short- and long-term adverse health effects. 
 
Short-term, breathing capacity can be reduced. And long-term effects can be more pernicious; according to Avol's studies, lung growth is stunted in young people who live in areas with high ozone pollution, making them more susceptible to respiratory and heart diseases later in life that could shorten life span. 
 
The pollutants issued by the vehicles in question are building blocks to other pollutants, including ozone and fine particles, called PM2.5, exposure to which has been linked to increased asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses. 
 
""NOx (is) a powerful chemical that in the hot California sun literally cooks and creates ozone and fine particles. That constitutes a direct threat to public health,"" said Richard Corey , executive officer of the California Air Resources Board , during the EPA news conference Sept. 18 announcing the VW emissions violation. 
 
""It's no secret California has unique challenges when it comes to air quality,"" Corey said. 
 
""We have a lot of cars and trucks, and we have a potent mixture of climate, topography and meteorological conditions that create some of the worst air quality in the nation."" 
 
Ozone forms best in warm, sunny weather with still winds. The top five most polluted cities for ozone in the U.S. are all in California , according to the American Lung Association's 2015 State of the Air Report. Of those, Los Angeles-Long Beach ranks first, followed by Visalia , Bakersfield , Fresno and Sacramento. California cities also claim the top six rankings for year-round and short-term particle pollution. 
 
Orange County received an ""F"" grade in the ALA report for having 10 so-called orange days for high ozone and 17 orange days for particle pollution. Orange days are considered unhealthy for vulnerable groups, including individuals with pediatric and adult asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 
 
Air agency officials estimate there are 4,000 premature deaths every year in Southern California from PM2.5 alone -- from all sources, not only passenger vehicles.

© Tribune Content Agency, source Regional News. Lawsuits for Consumers Who Purchased or Leased Certain Volkswagen Diesel Models Announced by Shareholders Foundation. SAN DIEGO, Sept.  24, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Shareholders Foundation, Inc. announces that several lawsuits were filed on behalf of consumers who purchased or leased certain Volkswagen and Audi diesel models alleging Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., alleging that the auto maker deliberately deceived consumers and regulators when it installed defeat devices in 482,000 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles in the U.S. 


Those who own or lease any of the following affected diesel VW models, Jetta (Model Years 2009–2015), Beetle (Model Years 2009–2015), Passat (Model Years 2014–2015), Golf (Model Years 2009–2015), or Audi A3 (Model Years 2009–2015), have certain options and should contact the Shareholders Foundation by email at mail@shareholdersfoundation.com  or call +1 (858) 779-1554. 
    
The plaintiffs in at least 25 lawsuits accuse Volkswagen Group of America of fraudulent concealment, false advertising, and violations of federal and state laws. 
 
Recently the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) to automakers Volkswagen AG and Audi AG and Volkswagen Group of America  (“VW”) alleging that certain four-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars from model years 2009-2015 include software that circumvents EPA emissions standards for certain air pollutants. 
 
According to the EPA, the affected models include: 
Jetta (Model Years 2009–2015) 
Beetle (Model Years 2009–2015) 
Golf (Model Years 2009–2015) 
Passat (Model Years 2014–2015) 
and 
Audi A3 (Model Years 2009–2015) 
 
More specifically, the EPA claims that VW manufactured and installed software in the electronic control module of the affected vehicles that sensed when the vehicle was being tested for compliance with EPA emission standards. The EPA alleges that during EPA emission testing, the vehicles’ emission control module ran software which produced compliant emission results under an emission control module calibration that VW referred to as the “dyno calibration” and that at all other times during normal vehicle operation the software was active and the vehicle emission control module software ran a separate “road calibration” which reduced the effectiveness of the emission control system and that as a result, emissions of NOx increased by a factor of 10 to 40 times above the EPA compliant levels, depending on the type of drive cycle. 
 
Those who own or lease any of the affected diesel models should contact the Shareholders Foundation by email at mail@shareholdersfoundation.com  or call +1 (858) 779-1554.

PHOTO. 2016 Audi A4 revealed in Frankfurt. Audi is playing safe with the styling of its upcoming A4, favouring a more conservative look compared with that of the Mercedes C-Class and BMW 3 Series. This is a direct response to feedback from customers in the US, Germany and China, the company’s leading markets. 
 
The new model will be revealed to the public at the Frankfurt motor show this month and will go on sale in the UK from November. Prices will start at £25,900 for the 1.4-litre TFSI. Avant models with the same engine will go on sale from April next year, starting at £27,300. The range-topper will be the Avant 3.0 V6 TDI Quattro, coming in at £40,350 when fitted with an eight-speed tiptronic auto. 
 
While the exterior appears to be little more than a facelift, Audi stresses that much is new. New features include a wider grille, revisions to the headlights and LED daytime running light graphics, a ‘clamshell’ bonnet and bigger wheel-arches. There are also low-set swage lines on each flank. Details such as a significantly flatter undertray, meanwhile, put the Audi at the top of the class when it comes to the drag co-efficient. 
 
 
 
A contemporary new interior now offers a host of upscale options. They include a digital 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, an 8.3-inch monitor, a wireless charging pad for mobiles, sensor control opening of the luggage compartment, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, tablet-based rear seat entertainment and the latest Multi Media Interface (MMI) system with a superfast LTE internet connection. 
 
Another technical highlight is Audi’s pre sense city system, which uses a windscreen camera to monitor the road. If it registers danger, the driver is given an acoustic warning. Full braking can also be deployed at up to 25mph. 
 
In terms of overall dimensions, the Audi is the same height as its predecessor, although it’s 25mm longer (4726mm) and 16mm wider (1842mm). The size increase hasn’t led to any weight gain, however. Audi, in fact, says that it has dropped by around 120kg thanks to measures including lightweight seats and the use of aluminium. 
 
 
 
The figures look good inside, too. Audi says that there is now an extra 24mm of head room and 11mm more in the way of shoulder room in the front. Leg room in the rear is also up by 23mm. 
 
As for boot space, the new A4 Avant, with its 505 litres, now has the edge over the BMW 3 Series Touring and the Mercedes-Benz C-class estate which offer 495 litres and 490 litres respectively. The Avant’s capacity stretches to 1510 litres when the 40\/20\/40 rear seat configuration is folded down. 
 
At launch, the A4 will be offered with a choice of three turbocharged four-cylinder petrol, two four-cylinder diesel and two V6 diesel engines. All will comply with the EU6 emissions standard. Audi claims that they deliver power increases of up to 25 per cent, while also being 21 per cent more economical than their predecessors. 
 
An entry-level 1.4-litre four-cylinder petrol unit develops 148bhp, which is 30bhp more than the 1.8-litre engine it replaces. This gives A4 1.4 TFSI saloon a 0-62mph acceleration figure of 8.9sec and a max speed of 131mph. Combined fuel consumption is 57.7mpg and CO2 emissions are 114g\/km in combination with the optional S tronic dual-clutch auto gearbox. 
 
 
 
The diesel line-up will include Audi’s well known 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit, upgraded with a new AdBlue exhaust injection system, in line with EU6 rules. For the traditionally best-selling A4 2.0 TDI model, 148bhp and 187bhp versions will be available. The former will reach 62mph from a standstill in 8.6sec and reach a 136mph maximum. Its combined fuel consumption is 74.3mpg, and CO2 emissions are 99g\/km in combination with the optional S tronic system. The latter posts a 0-62mph time of 7.7 seconds and goes on to a 147mph top speed. Combined fuel consumption is 68.9mpg; emissions are 107g\/km. 
 
For peak economy, Audi is also offering the A4 2.0 TDI as an Ultra version. In 148bhp saloon format, it’s said to consume just 76.4mpg and emit only 95g\/km. 
 
Front-wheel drive is standard on all models apart from the four-wheel drive A4 3.0 TDI. Additionally, four-wheel drive is an option on the 248bhp A4 2.0 TFSI and the 187bhp A4 2.0 TDI. 
 
Gearbox choices include a new six-speed manual on all four-cylinder engines. The previous Multitronic automatic has been replaced by a revised seven-speed dual-clutch S tronic system. The 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine gets a standard eight-speed automatic with a coasting feature to boost fuel efficiency.. Hungary frets over fallout of VW scandal on local factories. The sign of German car company Audi is attached on the engine of a TDI, a turbo diesel model, in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Sept. 28, 2015. Volkswagen AG's upmarket Audi brand said 2.1 million of its vehicles are among those with the engines affected by the emissions-rigging scandal. September 29, 2015 
Economy Minister Mihaly Varga says about 2 million of the engines suspected of being manipulated by VW to cheat environmental standards were made in Hungary by the Audi affiliate. Varga said Tuesday on broadcaster TV2 that while Hungary has strict environmental rules, it has no plans for now to ban the engines in question. 
 
Earlier, Varga said Hungary's economic growth, which is greatly dependent on the automotive industry, could fall 0.3-0.6 percent if European car markets decline because of the scandal. He said Tuesday that he hoped the worst projections could be avoided. 
   Subjects    Locations. CARS: A detailed look at new 2016 models, carmaker by carmaker. DETROIT - The 2016 model year has plenty of workhorses, including new versions of the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Titan pickups, Chevrolet Malibu and Kia Optima sedans and the Honda Civic small car.

But it also has some sparkling show horses. Ford, Audi, Ferrari and Acura all have new supercars. Cadillac is launching the racetrack-ready CTS-V. Dodge is unleashing its fastest Viper ever, and Lamborghini has amped up the power in its Aventador. Drivers with a smaller budget can also have a lot of fun in the new Ford GT350, Audi TT or Mazda MX-5 Miata.

Hyper luxury is in: Bentley is releasing its first SUV and Mercedes has a $189,350 Maybach version of its S-Class sedan with its own fragrance system. The new top-of-the-line Range Rover SVAutobiography starts at just under $200,000.

Carmakers haven't completely forgotten about fuel economy. Many are using more aluminum and high-strength steel to drop weight and improve fuel economy. The new Audi Q7 SUV is 717 pounds lighter than the previous version, while the new Chevrolet Camaro is up to 300 pounds lighter.

Toyota is introducing a new Prius hybrid and a hydrogen fuel cell car, the Mirai, which will be sold in California. Hyundai is releasing a hybrid version of the Sonata sedan. Chevrolet has a new Volt hybrid that goes for 53 miles on battery power alone, and Mercedes, Audi and BMW have new plug-in hybrids.

Here are new or significantly refreshed cars and trucks coming in the 2016 model year, by brand:

AUDI

A3 SPORTBACK E-TRON: This is the first plug-in hybrid Audi to hit the market. The five-seat wagon combines a 1.4-litre, four-cylinder gasoline engine and an electric motor powered by a battery hidden under the rear seats. It can be driven in electric mode for up to 19 miles; in hybrid mode, the car decides whether to use the motor, the gas engine or a combination of the two. Fuel economy numbers haven't yet been released. Recharging through a 120-volt outlet takes eight hours; recharging through a 240-volt outlet takes two hours and 15 minutes. Home installation of a 240-volt outlet and home charging station is optional. The Sportback e-tron goes on sale in October starting at $37,900.

A6\/A7: Audi's A6 midsize sedan, last redesigned in 2011, gets some significant updates. The front and rear have a taut new design and there are new LED headlights and a wider grille. The A6 has a new, more powerful base engine: a 2.0-litre four-cylinder with 252 horsepower, up from 220 horsepower in the previous model. The front-wheel-drive version is paired with a new, seven-speed transmission, while the all-wheel-drive quattro version has an eight-speed transmission. Both the A6 and its sibling, the coupe-like A7, also get a new 3.0-litre V6 engine option with 333 horsepower, up 23 horsepower from the previous model. Inside, there's a new wireless hotspot for up to eight devices in the car. There are also new safety features, including night vision with animal detection. The 2016 A6 and A7 went on sale this spring; the A6 starts at $46,200, the A7 at $68,300.

TT: The third generation TT coupe has a sportier, more muscular design and new LED headlights. Audi used more high-strength steel and aluminum to make the new TT lighter and stiffer. The TT coupe and roadster have a 2.0-litre, turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 220 horsepower; the sporty TTS coupe gets a turbocharged four-cylinder with 292 horsepower. Both are paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. Inside, there's a fully digital instrument cluster and the most advanced version of Audi's infotainment system, which reads newspaper headlines and Twitter alerts and can access more than 7,000 Web radio stations. The 2016 TT went on sale this summer, starting at $42,900.

Q7: This is Audi's first full redesign of its three-row, seven-seat SUV in nearly a decade. It has a shorter, leaner, more wagon-like look than its predecessor. Audi managed to shave 717 pounds off the Q7 by using more lightweight materials; the doors, engine hood and rear hatch are all made of aluminum. Audi says the weight savings help make the Q7 26 per cent more fuel efficient. U.S. buyers have three engine choices: a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder rated at 252 horsepower; a 3.0-litre turbodiesel with 272 horsepower; or a 3.0-litre supercharged V6 with 333 horsepower. Inside, the Q7 will be Audi's first vehicle that lets drivers access certain smartphone apps through Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto. The Q7 goes on sale early next year. Pricing hasn't been announced, but the current Q7 starts at $48,300.

R8: The second generation of Audi's R8 supercar has a racier, more chiseled look and a top speed of 200.7 miles per hour. It can go from 0 to 62 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds. Thanks to new construction with more extensive aluminum and carbon fiber, the R8 is 110 pounds lighter than the outgoing model. The V10 mid-engine comes in two variants: one with 540 horsepower and 398 pound-feet of torque and one with 610 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. The second is Audi's fastest and most powerful series-production Audi ever. An electric version, the R8 e-tron, is also available. It has a range of nearly 280 miles, up from 133 miles in the outgoing model. The R8 is already on sale in Europe, starting at $180,980. The U.S. sale date hasn't been announced.

___

BENTLEY

BENTAYGA: Bentley's first SUV — named for a rugged peak in the Canary Islands — goes on sale early next year. It has an aluminum body and a frame of aluminum and high-strength steel, a Bentley first. It's powered by a 12-cylinder engine, which Bentley says will make it the fastest production SUV in the world. Pricing hasn't been announced, but it's likely to be north of its nearest competitor, the $138,000 Range Rover Autobiography.

___

BMW

3 SERIES: The 340i high-performance variant of BMW's most popular line gets a new inline 3-Liter six-cylinder twin turbo that puts out 320 horsepower, 20 better than the current model. There's also the new 330e plug-in hybrid that can go 22 miles on battery power and puts out 250 horsepower.

Sale date and pricing not announced yet. 340i goes on sale in the fall. Pricing hasn't been revealed.

7 SERIES: The all-new flagship large sedan gets up to 190 pounds lighter and comes with an improved ride and better handling. BMW says it used a lot of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic in the passenger area to help shed the weight. In the U.S. it comes as a 740i and 750i xDrive. The 750i gets a revamped 4.4-litre V8 engine with 445 horsepower. 740i gets latest generation 3-litre inline turbocharged six with 320 hp. Plug-in hybrid 740e coming next year. Can go 23 miles on battery power alone. The 740i starts at $81,300 without shipping, while the 750i xDrive starts at $97,400. Both are available in the fall.

X1: New for 2016, the small SUV gets a roomier interior, more space for cargo and a new 2-litre twin-turbo four-cylinder engine that puts out 228 horsepower.

The four-seater is the brand's first convertible in a quarter-century, and it comes with a turbocharged 200-horsepower engine, and a safety system that deploys rollover protection bars behind the rear seats if the car detects that a crash is possible. The insulated soft top can be opened in 17 seconds while travelling up to 31 miles per hour. Price hasn't been released yet. The convertible is due in showrooms early next year.

___

Sedan starts at $60,465, the coupe at $62,665, both excluding shipping. Already on sale.

CTS-V: It's a new iteration of the racetrack-ready CTS based on the lighter and leaner new version of the midsize sports car.

CT6: Cadillac goes back to its roots with a new rear-drive luxury land yacht that isn't supposed to behave like one. The CT6 has an aluminum-intensive body with 11 different materials for strength, performance and efficiency. GM says it's lighter than the smaller BMW 5-Series. Buyers can choose from a new 3-litre twin-turbo V6 with 400 horsepower, plus two less-powerful engines from the previous generation. Night vision that helps identify people and large animals with heat signatures on a dashboard display. Pricing hasn't been announced. On sale early next year.

XT5: The first of the new generation of GM sport utilities is a replacement for the aging SRX midsize SUV. GM will release details later this year.

___

CHEVROLET

CAMARO: The classic Chevy muscle car slims down to fit on the frame of a Cadillac ATS small sports sedan. And it gets something that's almost unheard of in a muscle car: a standard four-cylinder engine. The sixth-generation Camaro loses 200 to 300 pounds over the 2015 model, and it's also shorter. And the new turbocharged 2-litre four is nothing to be embarrassed about. It puts out 275 horsepower, more than many V8s from years ago. But buyers also can choose a 335-horsepower V6 or 455-horsepower 6.2-litre V8 engine. Starts at $26,695, excluding shipping. Due in showrooms in the fall.

CRUZE: Chevy's now 5-year-old pedestrian-looking compact car is replaced with a more stylish, aerodynamic-looking sedan that's longer and 250 pounds lighter. GM engineers say the new Cruze addresses the faults of the old one, which had a noisy underpowered engine, a cramped back seat and bland styling. Gone are two older four-cylinder engines, both with 138 horsepower. They're replaced by an all-new 153-horsepower 1.4-litre turbo four. Six-speed manual is standard and a new six-speed automatic is available. It's due in showrooms in the spring. Price hasn't been announced.

MALIBU: General Motors makes another run at the popular midsize car segment. But if the sleeker and lighter new Malibu runs and handles as well as it looks, Chevy might make a dent in the market now controlled mainly by Honda and Toyota. The new sedan has a wide stance and a coupe-like look that's lower than the old version for better aerodynamics. A longer wheelbase creates more room inside the redesigned model, including 1.3 inches of additional rear-seat legroom. Comes standard with a new 1.5-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 160 horsepower. It's smaller and lighter than the previous four-cylinder, helping to cut 300 pounds of weight. GM says highway mileage will rise 1 mpg to 37. There's also a turbocharged 2-litre four-cylinder with 250 horsepower and an eight-speed automatic transmission. A gas-electric hybrid version gets an estimated 48 mpg in combined city and highway driving. Gasoline versions available in December and hybrid in the spring. Pricing not announced.

SPARK: The Korean-made inexpensive Chevy mini-car gets revamped with a more powerful 1.4-litre four-cylinder engine with 98 horsepower, 14 more than the current model. It also looks less bug-eyed and more modern, with a lower roof line, jeweled headlamps and a rounded front end. Choice of a continuously variable transmission or five-speed manual. Has 10 air bags for safety. Price hasn't been announced. Due in showrooms in the fall.

VOLT: Chevy's gas-electric hybrid gets sleeker looks and increased battery range in a redesign for 2016. The new Volt can go 53 miles on battery power before a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder engine kicks in to generate electricity and keep the car going. The current version goes only 38 miles on electricity. The new gas-powered generator also is more efficient than the current model. When it's on, the Volt gets 42 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving, 5 mpg better than the current car. The more aerodynamic look of the new Volt comes with a price, though. Rear-seat headroom is shallow, as is legroom. The new Volt is due out in the fall, priced at $33,170 excluding shipping and a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric cars.

___

DODGE

VIPER ACR: It stands for American Club Racer, and it's the fastest street-legal Viper ever, according to the company. The ACR is designed to squeeze faster track lap times out of the venerable Dodge super car with a race-tuned suspension. It has high-performance Kumho racing tires and is powered by the Viper's hand-built 8.4-litre V-10 with 645 horsepower. Already on sale. Starts at $117,895, excluding shipping and a gas-guzzler tax.

___

FERRARI

488 GTB, 488 SPIDER: New V8-powered sports cars that replace the 458 Italia and Spider. Each are powered by a 3.9-litre turbocharged motor that puts out 641 horsepower and takes the cars from zero to 62 miles per hour in a screaming 3 seconds. GTB is more aerodynamic than their predecessors with a double front spoiler and a new rear spoiler. The Spider has a retractable hard top. GTB available later this fall for about $245,000. Spider hits showrooms next year at about $275,000.

___

FIAT

500X: Fiat gets a much-needed small crossover SUV to take advantage of the worldwide SUV craze. The bulked-up 500 keeps the brand's cute European styling but can seat five comfortably. Choice of two engines, a 1.4-litre, 160-horsepower turbo four mated to a six-speed manual transmission and a 2.4-litre, 180 horsepower four with a nine-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive version has a rear axle that disconnects when it's not needed, for better fuel economy. Already on sale. Starts at $20,000 excluding shipping.

___

FORD

GT: After a decade's absence, Ford's GT returns at the end of 2016. The chiseled supercar looks more like a Ferrari than a Ford. It will get more than 600 horsepower with its mid-mounted, twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, which is mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission. It's Ford's most expensive vehicle ever, with a price tag around $400,000. The company plans to make just 250 GTs per year for the next several years.

SHELBY GT350\/GT350R: The GT350 is a performance version of the new Mustang, which went on sale last fall. It boasts a howling, 5.2-litre V8 engine with 526 horsepower. The aluminum hood is lower and more sloped than on the regular Mustang, for better aerodynamics. The inside is spare; chrome and bright finishes were removed to prevent sun glare from distracting the driver. If the GT350 isn't enough, enthusiasts can check out the GT350R, a pure racing car that's 130 pounds lighter than the GT350 thanks to the removal of anything extra, including air conditioning, rear seats and even carpet. There are carbon fiber wheels and a big rear spoiler for even faster cornering. Production will be limited. The GT350 starts at $49,995, which includes $1,300 for a gas-guzzler tax, which applies to cars with combined fuel economy under 22.5 mpg. The GT350R starts at $63,495.

___

HONDA

CIVIC: The current Civic compact car strayed from its roots with bland styling, a cheap interior and lacklustre performance. An emergency refresh after a year on the market improved it, but still didn't offer much excitement. That should change with the 2016, or 10th generation, model. Honda claims it will be the sportiest Civic ever, and judging from the fastback look of the coupe, the company may be right. The new Civic gets two new engines: a normally aspirated direct-injected four-cylinder with an undisclosed size, and a 1.5-litre, direct-injection turbo four-cylinder. Specifications haven't been released. They're mated to a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic. Sedan debuts later this fall, while the coupe comes in the winter. Prices haven't been released yet.

PILOT: Honda's biggest SUV gets re-engineered for 2016, shedding its worn-out boxy look for a more sculpted body that mimics its smaller cousin, the CR-V. It comes with an all-new 3.5-litre, direct-injected V6 with 280 horsepower, 30 more than the old version. It also gets two new automatic transmissions, either a six-speed or an optional nine-speed. The new power plant and transmission help the Pilot get up to 27 miles per gallon on the highway, two more than the 2015 model. For those who want luxury, the Pilot also gets a new Elite grade with a panoramic roof and second-row captain's chairs. Went on sale in June. Starts at $29,995 without shipping.

___

HYUNDAI

SONATA HYBRID: The gas-electric version of the Korean automaker's midsize car is new this year. The latest version gets a more powerful electric motor, a bigger battery pack and a revised transmission to boost fuel economy by about 10 per cent. Car is powered mainly by a 2-litre direct-injected four-cylinder gas engine, with a more powerful 38-kilowatt electric motor. Combined they put out 193 horsepower. Hybrid is expected to get 39 miles per gallon in the city and 44 mpg on the highway. Front and rear fascias and new wheels help it look different than standard Sonatas. Already on sale. Starts at $26,000 excluding shipping.

TUCSON: Hyundai's entry in the fast-growing small SUV market gets longer, wider, sleeker and more efficient. The automaker added 3 inches to the Tucson's length and made the SUV just over an inch wider. That increased passenger room and added more than 5 cubic feet to the cargo area. Suspension was bolstered to improve handling without hurting ride quality, Hyundai says. The old version's 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine is gone. Base model has a 2-litre, 164 horsepower four, while upper-level models get a 1.6-litre turbocharged four with 175 horsepower. The turbo engine gets a seven-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission. An Eco version is expected to get 33 mpg on the highway, while Sport and Limited front-wheel-drive versions get an estimated 30 mpg highway. That's 3 mpg better than the outgoing model. Already on sale. Starts at $22,700 excluding shipping.

___

JAGUAR

XF: All-new big luxury sedan goes on sale in October with a lightweight aluminum-intensive frame, a coupe-like look and more space inside. The second-generation car comes with a 3-litre supercharged V6, and buyers can chose between 340 and 380 horsepower versions in either rear or all-wheel-drive. The all-wheel-drive model is 265 pounds lighter than the previous version. All engines are mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions. Price hasn't been announced.

___

KIA

OPTIMA: Kia's bestseller in the U.S., the Optima midsize car, gets its first full redesign since 2011. It's longer, wider and stiffer, and has a bigger interior. There are three engine choices, including a new 1.6-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 178 horsepower. Two other engines — a 2.4-litre four-cylinder with 185 horsepower and a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 247 horsepower — are carried over from the previous Optima. Inside, Kia will soon offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow drivers to access certain apps from their smartphones on the car's 8-inch touchscreen. The 2016 Optima goes on sale at the end of this year. Pricing and fuel economy haven't been announced, but the 2015 Optima started at $21,690 and got up to 27 mpg in combined city\/highway driving.

SORENTO: The Sorento crossover, last redesigned in 2010, gets a thicker, brawnier look for 2016. It's longer and slightly wider and has a more aggressive grille with narrowed headlights. The Sorento comes in five- or seven-passenger configurations; the five-passenger gets either a 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine with 185 horsepower or a new 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 240 horsepower, while the seven-passenger gets a 290-horsepower V6. Inside, there's more headroom, legroom and cargo room than before. Kia is offering new safety technology, including a forward collision warnings system and blind-spot detection. The Sorento gets up to 24 mpg in combined city\/highway driving with the base engine, and up to 21 mpg with the V6. The Sorento, which went on sale in January, starts at $24,900.

___

LAMBORGHINI

AVENTADOR 750-4 SUPERVELOCE: If you have a spare $500,000, the new performance version of the Aventador — dubbed the Superveloce — might be for you. The track-ready race car has a 740-horsepower V12 engine — up from 700 in the Aventador — and is 110 pounds lighter thanks to more use of carbon fiber. It's the fastest series-production Lamborghini ever, with a blisteringly fast 0-62 mph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 217 mph. It gets 14.7 mpg in combined city\/highway driving if anyone cares. The Superveloce went on sale this summer, starting at $492,595. That includes a $3,700 gas-guzzler tax and a $3,495 shipping charge. A convertible version — the SV Roadster — goes on sale next spring for $530,075.

___

LEXUS

RX: Lexus' bestselling RX SUV gets its first major redesign since 2010. It has a polarizing design with a lot of sharp angles, including L-shaped LED front lights and a big spindle grille. The roof appears to float above the windows thanks to blacked-out pillars. Inside, there's more rear leg room and an available 12.3-inch dashboard monitor with a full-screen map. The RX is powered by an upgraded 3.5-litre V6 with 300 horsepower and a new eight-speed transmission. A hybrid version of the RX will also be available.

The Maxima went on sale in early June at a starting price of $32,410.

TITAN: Nissan, a bit player in the full-size truck market dominated by Ford, Chevrolet and Ram, hopes to shake things up with the new Titan. Among its engine offerings will be a Cummins 5.0-litre V8 turbo diesel, the kind of engine normally found on more expensive heavy-duty trucks. The engine gives the truck maximum towing capacity of more than 12,000 pounds and maximum payload of 2,000 pounds — near the top of the segment — but with what Nissan says will be 20 per cent better fuel economy than a gas-powered V8. Gas-powered V6 and V8 engines will also be available. Nissan will release pricing and other details closer to the launch of the new Titan later this year.

MIRAI: In Japanese, ""mirai"" means future, a fitting name for one of the world's first mass-produced hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The Mirai has an electric battery powered by hydrogen, and it emits nothing but water vapour from its tailpipe. It can go 312 miles between fill-ups and gets the equivalent of 67 miles per gallon. Like the gas-electric hybrid Prius, which it resembles, the Mirai is meant to be instantly recognizable as something different. Its pointy hood sits above huge, triangular air intakes, and the sides are swept back and deeply grooved. It could be tough to get your hands on one, since only a few hundred will be made in the first year. Only California buyers are eligible, and they must take delivery from one of eight authorized dealers in the Los Angeles or San Francisco areas. They must also live close to a hydrogen refuelling station. The Mirai starts at $57,500 plus an $835 destination fee; that price includes free fuel and maintenance for three years.

Starts at $48,900 without shipping.. 2.1 million Audis are also affected by the massive VW software scandal. Last week news broke about what could turn out to be one of the biggest fiascos in the history of the auto industry . But it's not just Volkswagen. Audi and (European-based) Skoda vehicles are now also thought to be affected. 
 
The deceptive software was uploaded on 2.1 million Audi cars and 1.2 million Skodas. 
 -advertisement-   
Audi released a statement saying that the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models are the ones in question and that over 13,000 American-owned Audi vehicles are subject to recall due to this scandal. 
 
From last week: 
 
Volkswagen intentionally installed software, called a defeat device, that made it appear its cars met the Clean Air Act standards that are enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency. This Act was implemented by the Obama administration and is intended to keep harmful pollutants out of the air. 
 
The deception worked like this: 
 
Volkswagen's software was rigged so it could tell when you were having your car tested, or if it was being inspected for emissions. During the emissions test, the software would order the car's engine into a different mode. 
 
This engine change would ensure the car did not violate the EPA's standards for nitrogen oxide emissions. 
 
However, once on the road, that same software would turn off those controls and the car would go back into normal driving mode. By some estimates, Volkswagen's cars were emitting up to 40 times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxide. 
 
Under its Clean Air Act policy, the Justice Department can impose fines of more than $37,000 for each affected vehicle. If fully imposed, the EPA can fine Volkswagen $18 billion. Worse for Volkswagen, its reputation may be permanently damaged. 
 
This recall affects Volkswagen and Audi diesel, 4-cylinder vehicles sold in the United States. The specific makes and models of the affected vehicles are the Jetta (2009-2015); Beetle (2009-2015); Golf (2014-2015), Passat (2014-15); and the Audi A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT and Q5  (2009-2015). 
 
If you have one of these cars, you should receive a recall notice. Or you can contact your local dealer for further instructions. 
    . VW’s Audi says 2.1 mn cars fitted with emission-cheat software. :11 

In Germany alone, 577,000 vehicles were affected and 13,000 in the United States, an Audi spokesman said. VW sparked global outrage last week when it admitted that 11 million of its diesel cars are fitted with so-called defeat devices that activate pollution controls during tests but covertly turn them off when the car is on the road. 
 
© 2015 AFP. Volkswagen to pick Porsche boss as new CEO: source. BERLIN - Volkswagen will fire three top executives on Friday, a senior source said, as the German carmaker tries to recover from a scandal over its rigging of U.S. vehicle emissions tests. 

One day after chief executive Martin Winterkorn quit, the source said the head of the company's U.S. operations and top engineers at premium VW brands Audi and Porsche would be dismissed, regardless of whether they knew about the cheating. 
  
But the worst scandal in the company's 78-year history showed no sign of abating as Germany's transport minister said on Thursday it had manipulated tests in Europe as well as the United States. 

VW is under pressure to act decisively, with its shares plunging since the crisis broke and German Chancellor Angela Merkel urging it to quickly restore confidence in a company held up for generations as a paragon of German engineering prowess. 

Winterkorn stepped down on Wednesday, saying Volkswagen needed a fresh start. The company now looks set to fire executives across its multi-brand group to weed out the source of the manipulations. 

""There will be further personnel consequences in the next days and we are calling for those consequences,"" Volkswagen board member Olaf Lies told the Bavarian broadcasting network. 

The research and development chiefs of Audi and Porsche, Ulrich Hackenberg and Wolfgang Hatz, will be removed by the supervisory board, as will VW's top executive in the United States, Michael Horn, the senior source told Reuters. 

Hackenberg and Hatz had both held senior posts at VW in development, including of engines, before they switched to Audi and Porsche. They are among VW's highest-ranking engineers. 

Horn acknowledged this week that the company had ""totally screwed up"" by deceiving U.S. regulators about how much its diesel cars pollute. 

The supervisory board is also due to announce a successor as chief executive.

This is far from over for those who committed this huge environmental fraud. 
 

 
See the original post: 
 VW Emissiongate: EX-CEO faces criminal investigation in Germany, Audi confirms 2.1 million of its cars involved in rigging. Volkswagen board suspends R&D heads of VW, Audi, Porsche. Volkswagen has suspended the R&D chiefs of its core VW brand, luxury division Audi and sports-car maker Porsche, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

The carmaker's supervisory board last Friday agreed to put a number of employees on leave until the details of VW's emissions cheating scandal were cleared up, without providing names. 

Reuters reported last Thursday that VW would fire top brand executives as it tries to recover from the scandal. 

Audi, VW and Porsche declined comment.. German prosecutors investigate Audi over emissions-paper. BERLIN, Sept 30 ( ) - German prosecutors have launched
a preliminary investigation into Volkswagen 
subsidiary Audi related to the scandal over rigged emissions, a
newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

Wolfram Herrle, chief prosecutor in Audi's hometown of
Ingolstadt in southern Germany, was quoted as telling the Funke
Media group that a preliminary investigation had been launched
to see whether to initiate formal proceedings against the
company. 

""We are currently reviewing all the facts in order to decide
whether an investigation should be initiated,"" he said. 

Neither the Ingolstadt prosecutors nor Audi were immediately
available to comment on the newspaper report. 

Volkswagen has admitted cheating diesel emissions tests in
the United States but Germany's transport minister says it also
manipulated tests in Europe, where it has much bigger sales, and
it faces the worst business crisis in its 78-year history. 

On Monday, the German prosecutor's office said it was
investigating former VW boss Martin Winterkorn over ""allegations
of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data""
based on charges filed by about 10 unidentified individuals. 

Winterkorn, replaced as chief executive on Friday by company
veteran Matthias Mueller, said when he quit last week that he
was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part and wanted to give
the company a new start. 

Among those suspended in the scandal were Ulrich Hackenberg,
the head of research and development at premium brand Audi, who
oversees technical development across the group. 

Audi has said 2.1 million of its cars were affected by the
scandal, including the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models.

 (Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Christian Plumb). Audi emphasises the ‘S’ with new plus version SQ5 TDI. The already formidable Audi SQ5 TDI reinforces its status as a practical SUV delivering genuine sportscar pace this week as it becomes the latest Audi ‘S’ model to undergo the performance-intensifying ‘plus’ treatment. With more power, more torque and more equipment than its ‘standard’ counterpart, which is notable as the first ever diesel-powered Audi S model and remains in the line-up, the new SQ5 TDI plus will be available to order later this year. UK pricing will be also be confirmed at a later date. 
 
The biturbo V6 TDI at the heart of the SQ5 TDI plus produces 340 PS from its three litres of displacement by way of increased injection pressure. This results in 27 PS more power compared to the current SQ5 TDI. Its peak torque is increased by 50 Nm (36.9 lb-ft) to 700 Nm (516.3 lb-ft), enabling acceleration from rest to 62 mph in a mere 5.1 seconds; top speed is electronically limited at 155 mph. According to the NEDC combined cycle consumption test, up to 42.8mpg is also potentially  achievable with emissions of 174 g CO2\/km, which along with the plentiful torque serves as just about the only reminder that this performance flagship prefers diesel. 
  
 
Like all S models from Audi, the SQ5 TDI plus delivers its power to the road via the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. For the first time on a Q5 variant, a sports differential at the rear axle actively distributes the drive power between the wheels. 
 
More immediately noticeable clues to the plus version’s status can be found externally, where its rank is conveyed by gloss black 21-inch cast aluminium Audi Sport wheels in 5-twin-spoke star design and an extended black gloss package taking in the exterior mirror housings, door handles, roof edge spoiler and rear diffuser. A further visual customisation feature on the exterior are two clasps that join the four exhaust tailpipes in pairs. 
 
Inside, diamond stitched fine Nappa leather upholstery further enhances the SQ5 sports seats in the plus version, and the sliding rear bench seat plus also features as standard to increase variability and enlarge the luggage compartment, if necessary. 
 
The post appeared first on SalfordOnline.com .. VWs go back to the factory after illegal diesel hack discovery. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California officials say some 482,000 Volkswagen and Audi diesels were engineered to falsify their emissions for federal tests — a violation that opens the German automaker to a theoretical fine totaling $18 billion. The affected models had software in their computer engine controls that could sense exactly when they were being tested for emissions quality. At all other times, the diesels would run in a different mode with illegal levels of pollution — for example, spewing up to 40 times more nitrogen oxide, a key component of smog, than allowed. 

Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health. 
Cynthia Giles, EPA assistant administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance 
While other automakers have been accused of violating the Clean Air Act, this is the first time one has been found to have designed software specifically to circumvent the law. However, owners are able to keep their cars; they remain legal to drive and sell. Volkswagen issued a statement saying it was cooperating with the agencies and would have no further comment today.

The e-tron quattro is based on Audi’s MLB platform as found in the latest Q7, while it has a similar powertrain to the latest R8 e-tron. But the Q6 will have an electric motor in the gearbox and two in the rear axle, each one driving a rear wheel (the R8 e-tron has two motors). 
 
The e-tron quattro SUV is intended to have more power than the R8 e-tron. With 500bhp and 516lb ft, it will have nearly 50bhp more than the R8 version. The power will be drawn from a lithium-ion battery set low down in the chassis, for a low centre of gravity. Audi claim this will improve the driving response to place it above any other vehicle in the segment. The battery is intended to have a range of over 300 miles and may produce 90kWh. 
 
The chassis is a mixture of hot-formed steel, aluminium and carbonfibre-reinforced plastic. It is not yet known if Audi will use steel springs or an air-sprung arrangement. 
 
The interior will be on a par with the next generation A8 luxury saloon, so it should have the latest infotainment and features. Audi say they aim to make driving this zero-emission vehicle “a pleasure not a compromise”.

VW’s emissions-cheating diesels ‘broke public trust’; 2.1m Audis affected. Audi has revealed that approximately 2.1 million of its vehicles were fitted with the VW Group’s ‘defeat device’, which reduced nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions during emission tests. 

An American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation found the software in VW’s EU5-compliant, two-litre, four-cylinder turbo diesel (TDI) engines, which were also used in Audis worldwide. According to the Reuters news agency, models including the TT (pictured), A3, A4, A6, Q1 and Q3 have been affected, although the software is not found in latest-generation cars with EU6-compliant engines.

The British government has launched an investigation and called on the EU to introduce a Europe-wide inquiry into vehicle emissions in light of the EPA’s findings. 

The EPA originally estimated that the device could appear on up to 482,000 cars, namely VW’s Golf [pictured], Jetta, Passat, Beetle and the Audi A3, produced since 2008, but the VW Group’s findings indicate that the issue could affect more than five million cars globally. 

“Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,” said the EPA’s Cynthia Giles. 

“[We are] committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules [and we] will continue to investigate these very serious matters.” 

When the news broke, VW CEO Prof. Dr. Winterkorn said he was “deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public” and would “cooperate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly, and completely establish all of the facts of this case.” 

Prof. Dr. Winterkorn later announced his resignation, saying he bore “responsibility for the irregularities that have been found” although he claimed “not to be aware of any wrongdoing” on his part. 

An external investigation has been commissioned by Volkswagen, but immediate fallout from the news saw shares in VW nosedive by nearly 12% early on Monday morning. 

The company has said that EU6-compliant VW models such as the current Golf are believed to be unaffected by the emissions-skewing “defeat device”, but the previous-generation Passat and Golf could both be affected. 

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: “The Vehicle Certification Agency, the UK regulator, is working with vehicle manufacturers to ensure that this issue is not industry wide. As part of this work they will re-run laboratory tests where necessary and compare them against real world driving emissions.”. Audi, Porsche R&D chiefs, VW US CEO to quit. The Volkswagen diesel scandal continues. According to Reuters, Volkswagen will dismiss the R&D chiefs of Audi and Porsche and its CEO in the United States where the German carmaker has been found manipulating diesel emission rules.  Audi R&D boss Ulrich Hackenberg, Porsche’s Wolfgang Hatz and VW’s U.S. chief executive Michael Horn will be dismissed at a meeting of the supervisory board on Friday, the source told Reuters. 
 
Yesterday, VW head honcho, Martin Winterkorn resigned as well . 
 

 
VW was caught gaming the EPA and CARB (California Air Resources Board) diesel emissions tests (particulates and nitrous oxide) which triggered a huge media scandal. It has been reported that VW has earmarked 6.5B Euros for re-mediation, that is to ‘fix’ the problem with the existing cars. This is above and beyond a potential $18B fine that the EPA may levy. 
 
The emissions scandal has wiped nearly 26 billion euros ($29 billion) off its market value this week. 
 
In stepping down Wednesday, Winterkorn said he was “not aware of any wrongdoing on my part” but had accepted the “responsibility for the irregularities that have been found in diesel engines and have therefore requested the Supervisory Board to agree on terminating my function as CEO of the Volkswagen Group.” 
 
The article Audi, Porsche R&D chiefs, VW US CEO to quit appeared first on BMW BLOG. National Drive Electric Week in LA. By Maria Ramos
The world is facing a major problem in the coming years. For so long we have been dependent on oil and fossil fuels that our planet is now in peril. Not only are we beginning to run low on the petroleum and oil that has kept our society running, but the pollution caused by our overuse of fossil fuels is slowly killing our planet. While many people understand the importance electric vehicles play in reducing our carbon footprint, there are still plenty of folks who haven't even considered making the switch yet. It is for these folks that the 2015 National Drive Electric Week is happening. First held in 2011, the originally dubbed National Plug-In Day was so popular that it quickly expanded to fill an entire week's worth of fun and excitement. From September 12-20, more than 160 events are scheduled to take place all across America (and a few in Canada and Hong Kong) that will highlight the benefits of driving electric. These events are organized by local groups and individuals that are passionate about our planet and how switching to electric can help. In Los Angeles, EV enthusiasts can catch a variety of electrifying events. On September 13, a free event is being held at Exposition Park. From 11 am to 3 pm, you can head out and test drive some of the newest plug-in vehicles from top manufacturers like BMW, Audi, and Kia. There will also be a variety of speakers including politicians, actors, and activists, giveaways, and the debut of the Chevy Bolt Concept Car. There are events also being held in Torrance, Diamond Bar, Long Beach, and Woodland Hills, where actor Ed Begley, Jr. will be a guest speaker. Other events being held all over the country include live music, more speakers, and a lot of demonstrations and test drives. To show that even one person can make a difference, Brian Kent began what he is calling the Negative Carbon US Road Trip. This road trip started on August 24, in Albion, NY. From there, Brian will be driving to all 48 contiguous states in his Nissan Leaf and planting a tree in each one. By his estimations, these trees will trap more than 10 times the amount of CO2 Brian's Leaf will produce on this country-wide adventure. While these events have a lot of fun activities planned for the whole family, there is definitely an underlying message to be heard. To help bring light to this message, the National Drive Electric Week events will showcase many of the benefits of driving an electric vehicle has over their gas-guzzling counterparts. Of course, there are the obvious advantages of lowering emissions and reducing pollution, but there are actually a number of other advantages that may not get as much ink. Everyone likes to save a penny or two and buying an electric vehicle can actually save you a whole lot of pennies. Sure, you will be hitting the pump a lot less, and with the rising cost of gas these days, that is quite a savings in itself. But there are also federal tax credits and state incentives available for qualifying vehicles. Another big thing happening is the national 'smart grid.' This new proposal would essentially link power grids from all over the country and allow stored, renewable energy from one place to power homes in another rather than everyone relying on traditional energy providers. For example, an excess of hydropower from the northwest can help homes as far away as South Dakota. Driving EV’s just makes more sense. It is cheaper in the long-run and a great solution for our environmental hardships. As renewable energy becomes more widespread in America, the benefits of driving electric will actually rise even more. Remember to show your love for electric vehicles at Exposition park on September 13.. 2017 Audi A4 First Drive: Technology, Not Emotion. “Vorsprung durch Technik,” Audi’s longtime marketing slogan, makes absolutely zero sense to most Americans, but the fifth-generation A4 should make things clear—the car is the virtual embodiment of the slogan, which means “Advancement through Technology.” The car is packed to the brim with technology, so there’s some Wahrheit in der Werbung (Truth in Advertising) here. […]…  
“Vorsprung durch Technik,” Audi’s longtime marketing slogan, makes absolutely zero sense to most Americans, but the fifth-generation A4 should make things clear—the car is the virtual embodiment of the slogan, which means “Advancement through Technology.” The car is packed to the brim with technology, so there’s some Wahrheit in der Werbung (Truth in Advertising) here. 

The 2017 A4 is an exceedingly intellectual automobile, blowing the academic curve in many respects both for the Audi brand and for the premium-sedan segment in general. Take, for example, the claimed 0.23 coefficient of drag, which not only is Audi’s best ever but places it just 0.01 off the industry-leading claim made for the Mercedes-Benz CLA-class. Audi says it achieved this by moving the mirrors lower on the door panels, smoothing the underbody, and making other minor tweaks learned through comprehensive wind-tunnel testing. The A4 also brings Audi’s cool Virtual Cockpit instrument cluster, inductive phone charging, 30-hue ambient lighting, and Apple CarPlay\/Android Auto functionality. Its laundry list of driving aids includes Traffic Jam Assist (radar-based semiautonomous driving up to 40 mph, including steering) and Exit Warning, which audibly and visually warns occupants exiting the car when an approaching motorist or bicyclist might strike an open door. 

Style Stands Still 

Progress has not been made in every respect, however. Styling has at best stood still, despite the subtle reconstitution of each body component to impart a longer, wider, more precision-crafted look. The clamshell hood, for example, features four elegant creases, and the shut-lines were moved to the car’s “tornado” line. The headlamps are at once more slitlike and brighter, with standard bixenon or optional all-LED bulbs, while the wider taillamps contain nifty sequential turn-signal strips. The grille is broader, and the car as a whole appears more planted on account of a lower-body “light catcher.” Overall, though, the A4 looks merely refreshed, not redesigned, which is to say it’s as stoic, elegant, and unerringly correct as always. 

That’s a shame, since so much was improved elsewhere. Despite having grown 0.5 inch in wheelbase, 1.0 inch in length, and 0.6 inch in width, the 2017 A4 has dropped some 70 to 100 pounds, says Audi, due to extensive use of lightweight materials in key areas, including brake components, suspension parts, and stampings. 

In the cabin, front head- and shoulder room have increased, as has rear legroom. A horizontally arranged dashboard dominated by a full-width decorative band that also contains the air vents helps the cabin feel quite spacious if not terribly intimate. Our test car came kitted out with gorgeous open-pore wood and buttery nappa leather that would be at home in the A8, and we can also vouch for the stylishness of the A4’s available patterned aluminum trim. The MMI infotainment system now offers a fixed, 8.3-inch dashtop screen; pinch-and-zoom functionality via a touchpad; and an octet of preset buttons for common functions. But the biggest news inside is the Virtual Cockpit gauge cluster that we have quickly come to admire. Here, as in the new Q7, it supplements the center screen so as to allow passengers to fiddle with the infotainment system, too. (Audi sports cars with the digital cluster, such as the new TT and R8, do not offer a central screen at all.) 

Two 2.0s 

A pair of 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines is scheduled to be offered when the car hits U.S. dealerships early next year. One is a turbocharged TFSI gasoline unit pumping out 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, while the other is a diesel unit rated for now at 190 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. (The diesel output might—or might not—change pending an update to VW’s TDI engines in the wake of the emissions scandal involving the engine. Availability may also be delayed.) Both mate to an all-new, seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Unconfirmed at this point but very likely to appear within a year of launch is a less-powerful, Miller-cycle version of the 2.0-liter gas engine, paired with a six-speed manual transmission and likely to top 40 mpg in highway fuel economy. 

The A4’s media drive took place near Venice, Italy, immediately following the car’s Frankfurt auto-show debut; the only version available for us to drive was the TFSI Quattro with the DSG automatic. On the back roads between the Venice airport and the scenic Dolomites, the TFSI engine proved impressively torquey and willing to rev to its power peak, and while turbo lag is minimal, midrange throttle response is fabulous. Meanwhile, the DSG’s shifts felt more akin to a conventional automatic’s than, say, the Volkswagen GTI’s DSG, although we’re told that the gearbox will be tuned further for U.S. duty to deliver more responsive…. Audi Q7 – loads of luxury, space and desirability. What’s new?

Large premium sport utility vehicles are more popular than ever and, after the original Q7 was around for nearly nine years, Audi has launched a new one.

The second-generation Q7 has a new body and chassis with a substantial weight reduction, a new exterior and interior, the latest engines and a major upgrade of standard and optional technology in the quest for the best-in-class title.

Audi Q7

Price: Audi Q7 3.0 TDI SE £50,340 (range from £47,755)

Engine: 3.0-litre, 269bhp, V6 turbo diesel

Transmission: Eight-speed automatic gearbox driving all four wheels

Performance: 0-62mph 6.5 seconds; top speed 145mph

MPG: 47.9 combined

CO2 emissions: 153g\/km

Looks and image 

Presence and stature are everything at this end of the market, and Audi has given the Q7 as much of both as possible. Ditching the grey plastic cladding around the lower portion of the car for body colour makes it smarter, and the curvy waistline has been ditched for something more squared off. Whether it’s better looking or not is a matter of opinion – the front grille is inspired by the smaller Q3 but looks huge on the Q7.

There’s nothing to touch the Q7’s image this side of a full-size Range Rover. People will see you coming and be in no doubt about which manufacturer your mighty SUV comes from.

Space and practicality

It might be lighter than the old car but the new Q7 is not short of space. Inside it is vast – wherever you sit there’s head, leg and shoulder room in spades. Larger windows add to the roomy feeling while the space is very well managed. The third row of seats stow electrically while the second row tilts and folds for easy access. You can fit three child seats across the second row. With five seats in use there’s 770 litres of boot space, and 1,990 with them all folded.

Behind the wheel

There are few better views than from behind the wheel of the Q7, thanks to the high driving position and large glazed area. There’s fewer buttons now thanks to the slick MMI Touch system and it all works beautifully well.

The latest 3.0-litre TDI turbo diesel is a gem. Refined and with plenty of torque, it can move the Q7 along very briskly with 0-62mph taking only 6.5 seconds, although it’s so refined it doesn’t feel as fast. Remarkably it’s also frugal with it, with a claimed combined consumption figure of 47.9mpg with 153g\/km of CO2.

It’s secure and stable rather than thrilling to drive but the level of comfort is most important, and the refined driving experience and low noise levels are impressive.

Value for money

All Q7 models come with a lengthy standard specification, with highlights such as DAB audio with satellite navigation, electrically-operated and heated front seats, electrically-folding third row and electric tailgate, cruise control, automatic lights and wipers, front and rear parking system, keyless start and hill descent control. SE models get 19in wheels and S Line 20in ones.

The options list is huge too but includes goodies like the clever virtual cockpit already seen in the TT, Apple Car Play or Google Android Auto and a smart rear tablet for entertaining passengers.

Who would buy one?

If there was ever a perfect family wagon then the new Q7 is it. With so much space inside, and a great deal of flexibility, it can cope with all kinds of passenger and luggage combinations. It’s not cheap of course but it’s a luxurious cabin and an effortless driving experience to boot.. Audi unveils electric SUV to take on Tesla.

For more than a week, Volkswagen has been the center of an emissions scandal in which it admitted that nearly 11 million diesel engine vehicles worldwide come equipped with software that tricked emissions tests. While an order of violation from the Environmental Protection Agency included several Audi sedans, VW had yet to announce just how many of those vehicles were affected worldwide. Now we know: 2.1 million. Volkswagen announced on Monday that about 2.1 million Audi vehicles have the software – known as a “defeat device” – that disables air-emissions controls during normal driving conditions, the Wall Street Journal reports. A spokesperson for VW says that a majority of the more than 2 million vehicles affected by the issue were sold in Europe. Just 13,000 were sold in the U.S. and Canada. Affected models include the Audi A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3, and Q5. Additionally, Spanish brand Seat and Czech brand Skoda announced Monday that some of their models also include the defeat devices. However, the number of cars affected by those brands was not yet available. Audi Confirms 2.1 Million Cars Involved in Volkswagen Emissions Scandal [The Wall Street Journal]. Audi A3 celebrates 20th anniversary. ""20 years of the Audi A3 - that is 20 years of success in the compact class. Back then, we founded a new segment with the A3. Today, the high-volume A3 family is a fixed component of our model lineup,"" says Prof. Dr. Hubert Waltl, Audi Board Member for Production. ""Two decades of the Audi A3 - and behind it a highly qualified production team. Without them, such a success story would not have been conceivable."" Peter Mosch, Chairman of the Audi General Works Council: ""The Audi A3 is a very strong pillar for protecting jobs. That is why the Works Council supports continued production of such important models here at the home plant in Ingolstadt. Job growth over the past 20 years alone confirms that this is the right path."" 

When it made its debut, the Audi A3 was already setting new standards in the compact class with its sporty character, high-quality workmanship and optional quattro all-wheel drive system. At the Ingolstadt production site, innovative production technologies and maximum flexibility in body manufacturing have been guaranteeing this top quality right up to today. Here, Audi produces the Audi A3, A3 Sportback, A3 Sportback e-tron and A3 Sportback g-tron models. In 2014 alone, this represented a total of 188,465 automobiles. 

Meanwhile, the compact car from Ingolstadt has become a global player. It has conquered the roads in over 100 sales markets, and it is also manufactured at other Audi production sites. In 2001, the Audi Group had already extended portions of A3 production to its production site in Gyor. Today, the Audi A3 Sedan and A3 Cabriolet come off the assembly line at that plant, and in 2014 production volume there was 117,578 models. Last year, a total of 46,000 Audi A3 Sportback and A3 Sedan cars were produced at the Chinese plant in Foshan. 10,000 additional A3 Sedans were built in Aurangabad, India. Very soon, the premium brand will be producing the A3 Sedan in Brazil as well. Total production volume since the car made its debut 20 years ago is 3,647,833 A3 models. 

Series production of the first plug-in hybrid model at the Ingolstadt plant is a ground-breaking achievement in the direction of electric mobility. Here, Audi is producing the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron in the same cycle time and on the same line as conventional A3 models. Demand is especially strong in the Netherlands where every second Audi A3 Sportback car sold is an e-tron. Chinese customers have been able to buy the Audi A3 e-tron since July. It will launch in the USA at the end of 2015. 

The brand with the four rings also produces the low-emission Audi A3 Sportback g-tron on the existing A3 production line in Ingolstadt. The g-tron is the first natural-gas powered car to be produced by the brand. The model can use either fossil-based natural gas or climate-protecting Audi e-gas as fuel. The g-tron is especially popular in Italy where one out of nine A3 Sportback cars sold is powered by natural gas.

Frankfurt, Germany :  A sense of impending disruption hangs over all the shiny new cars at this year's edition of the Frankfurt International Motor Show.
The potential impact of automated driving and of extensively connected cars has pushed aside…  
Frankfurt, Germany • A sense of impending disruption hangs over all the shiny new cars at this year's edition of the Frankfurt International Motor Show. 

The potential impact of automated driving and of extensively connected cars has pushed aside electric and low-emission vehicles as the major theme in just the two years since the show was last held. 

New technologies could lead to everything from real-time navigating around a slippery stretch of road, to eliminating the need for a home garage by having cars drive themselves to people who summon them through a mobile app. 

The big question among automakers is whether they will be the ones to provide new technologies — and profit from them — or will major tech companies like Google and Apple take a slice of the industry. For now, the two sides are balancing cooperation against competition as they gauge what the future holds. 

General Motors CEO Mary Barra succinctly expressed a common view, asserting that ""we will see more change in the industry in the next five to ten years than we have in the last 50."" 

Dieter Zetsche, the head of Daimler AG, described the car and technology companies as being ""frenemies."" 

He said Daimler would welcome competition, which he called ""the energy source for our economy."" What is important, he said, was for Daimler to keep control of customers' data, to not sell it to third parties, and to obey customer wishes on how it is used. That was his company's rationale for joining with Audi and BMW to buy Nokia's HERE mapping service: ""To be sure we define the fate of the data being gathered."" 

If Apple or Google start making cars — something neither has said they intend to do — ""then we are competitors."" 

Consultancy McKinsey found expectations of rapid change were widespread in the industry. In a survey of 91 industry executives for a report released Wednesday, it found 90 percent ""believe that their organization's business model will change or broaden because of connectivity and autonomous driving."" 

The company also found that more car customers would be willing to switch brands for better connected services. The number that would do so rose from 20 percent in 2014 to 37 percent this year. The company surveyed over 1,000 recent car customers each in Germany, the U.S. and China: ""The fact that within just one year the number of people willing to switch car brands for connectivity has almost doubled shows that connectivity is evolving from a should-have to a must-have"" for carmakers. 

More and more carmakers support the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay interfaces that let people use their smartphone apps, such as navigation or messaging, through their car's dashboard screen. Seven automakers had cars with Android Auto on display in Frankfurt: Audi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and its SEAT and Skoda brands, and Opel. General Motors has been connecting cars for years through its OnStar remove roadside assistance service, which it extended to its mass-market entrant in Europe. 

Google had no stand at the show, but has shaken up the auto industry by testing a self-driving car prototype. Traditional automakers such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, GM and Toyota are also working to gradually automate functions in the car until vehicles become fully capable of driving themselves, possibly by 2025. 

A key issue is when some automated functions become legal, and in what countries. Some of these technologies — especially for cars that drive thems…. EPA accuses VW of cheating on emission rules. (CNNMoney) -  
Diesel cars from Volkswagen and Audi cheated on clean air rules by including software that made the cars' emissions look cleaner than they actually were, according to federal and California regulators. 
 
The regulators say that the software on the cars turns up emission controls only when it detects that the car was being tested. 

""The effectiveness of these vehicles' pollution emissions control devices is greatly reduced during all normal driving situations,"" said the Environmental Protection Agency's notice to the company. ""This results in cars that meet emissions standards in the laboratory or testing station, but during normal operation, emit nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the standard."" 

There are nearly 500,000 of these diesel cars on U.S. roads. The models include the VW Jetta, the Beetle and the Golf from model years 2009 through 2015, the Passat from 2014-2015 as well as the Audi A3, model years 2009-2015. The Audi luxury brand is owned by Volkswagen Group. 

Owners of the affected cars do not face health risks, according to the EPA, and can to continue to drive or sell them. But the EPA has ordered VW to recall the cars and fix the violation. No recall has yet been announced. 

Representatives from EPA and the California Air Resources Board, which did the testing that uncovered the problem, would not say whether a change to the software would have a negative impact on the cars' performance or the fuel economy. 

Volkwagen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The EPA did not say how much VW would ultimately be fined for this infraction. 

Diesel cars get much better fuel economy than gasoline powered cars.. 2015 Audi A4 to be priced from £25,900. http:\/\/ift.tt\/1FsHLps



Fifth-generation A4 saloon due on sale in the UK in November, with Avant and Allroad models to follow

The fifth-generation Audi A4 will cost from £25,900 when it goes on sale in the UK this November.
The new A4 features an evolutionary exterior, contemporary interior, heavily revised petrol and diesel engine line-up and a newly developed chassis. It will be seen in public for the first time at the Frankfurt motor show later this month.
Styled under former Audi design boss Wolfgang Egger prior to his move to Giugario in early 2014, the new A4 boasts an evolutionary appearance that is intended to make it look more formal than its main rivals, the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, in line with feedback gained from existing customers in its largest markets, China, Germany and USA.
Read our first drive review of a pre-production 2015 Audi A4 here
Key elements include a wider single-frame grille, newly shaped headlights with revised LED daytime running light graphics, a clamshell-style bonnet, larger wheelhouses, a flatter roof, a more prominent shoulder with a deep swage line running the length of the flanks, greater structure in the lower part of the doors, sharp new tail-lights featuring a new take on Audi’s traditional LED graphics and, on the saloon, a higher boot lid. 
Although appearing a lot like a facelifted version of its predecessor, every body panel is described as new. Greater attention to aerodynamics, including the adoption of a largely flat undertray and detailed sculpturing around the rear end, has also netted the new Audi a class-leading drag co-efficient of 0.23 for the saloon.
Hilton Holloway opinion - the new Audi A4's quality blitz
The new A4 has grown, but only slightly. With a length of 4726mm, width of 1842mm and height of 1427mm, it is 25mm longer, 16mm wider and the same height as its predecessor in saloon guise. This makes it 41mm longer, 32mm wider and 13mm lower than the latest Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The adoption of the latest evolution of Audi’s MLB platform has also seen its wheelbase increase by 12mm to 2820mm.Despite the bump in size, Audi claims the A4’s weight has been reduced by up to 120kg through the adoption of hot-formed high-strength steel within the body structure and aluminium for various body panels, including the roof. 
While its exterior styling leans heavily on that of its predecessor, the interior of the new A4 boasts a contemporary new design that provides it with greater space than ever before. Audi claims an additional 24mm of head room in combination with 11mm more shoulder room up front. The incremental stretch in the wheelbase has also provided the basis for a 23mm increase in rear seat legroom.
Audi also promises added levels of comfort through the adoption of newly designed seats that are claimed to weigh 9kg less than those of the old model.
Boot space is up by 15 litres in the new A4 Avant at 505 litres, increasing to 1510 litres when the standard 40\/20\/40 split rear seat is folded away. By comparison, the BMW 3 Series Touring boasts a nominal 495 litres, while the Mercedes-Benz C-class Estate offers 490 litres.
Buyers can choose between a wide range of high-end options including a 12.3in digital instrument panel, an 8.3in monitor, inductive charging pad for mobile phones, sensor control opening of the luggage compartment, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, tablet-based rear seat entertainment and the latest version of the German car maker’s Multi Media Interface (MMI) system that features an LTE internet connection.
Among a list of standard safety items is Audi’s pre sense city system, which has been developed to prevent accidents at typical urban driving speeds. Using a windscreen stereo camera to monitor the road, it provides an acoustic warning and full preventative braking at speeds up to 25mph.  
The new A4 will be launched with a choice of three turbocharged four-cylinder petrol, two four-cylinder diesel and two V6 diesel engines, all featuring EU6 emission compliance. They are claimed to provide power increases of up to 25 per cent and economy gains of up to 21 per cent over the engines they succeed.
A new 1.4-litre four-cylinder petrol unit delives 148bhp, or 30bhp more than the previous base 1.8-litre four-cylinder petrol engine it replaces. This is sufficient to provide the price-leading A4 1.4 TFSI saloon with 0-62mph acceleration of 8.9sec and a 131mph top speed together with combined consumption of 57.7mpg and CO2 emissions of 114g\/km in combination with the optional S tronic dual-clutch automatic gearbox.
Further up the range is a reworked version of Audi’s 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine. It comes in two differing states of tune, providing the new A4 2.0 TFSI with either 187bhp or 248bhp. Audi quotes a 0-62mph time of 7.3sec and a top speed of 149mph along with figures of 58.8mpg and 114g\/km for the former, while the latter boasts a 0-62mph time of 5.8sec, a limited 155mph top speed, 49.6mpg and 129g\/km, both in combination with the optional S tronic  gearbox. 
Among the quartet of diesels available at launch will be Audi’s familiar 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit. Updated with a new AdBlue exhaust injection system as mandated by EU6 emission regulations, it initially comes in two states of tune, with either 148bhp or 187bhp in what has traditionally been the strongest selling model in the line-up, the A4 2.0 TDI.
The former provides 0-62mph acceleration of 8.6sec and a 136mph top speed, together with combined consumption of 74.3mpg and CO2 emissions of 99g\/km in combination with the optional S tronic gearbox. The latter boasts an official 0-62mph time of 7.7sec and a 147mph top speed as well as 68.9mpg and 107g\/km.
In line with recent new Audi models, the A4 2.0 TDI will be available as an aerodynamically optimised Ultra model featuring exterior styling tweaks, revised gearbox ratios, lowered suspension and low-rolling-resistance tyres. In 148bhp guise it is claimed to return 76.4mpg and 95g\/km in saloon form, making it the most economical car in its class according to Audi.  
Rounding out the launch line-up is a 3.0-litre V6 diesel. As with the outgoing A4, it comes in two states of tune, developing either 218bhp or 272bhp in the A4 3.0 TDI. Provisional figures suggest the former will return 67.3mpg for average CO2 emissions of 110g\/km.
Also planned but not confirmed for UK sale is a natural gas-powered model. Set for sale during the second half of 2016 in Avant guise only, the A4 Avant g-tron runs a 170bhp version of the turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine used in other new A4 models adapted to run on either petrol or natural gas. Allied with a series of tanks mounted at the rear, it is claimed to provide a range of up to 280 miles using natural gas and 311 miles on petrol. 
Front-wheel drive is standard on all models save for the initial range-topping A4 3.0 TDI, which receives a four-wheel drive system that apportions power in a nominal 40\/60 front\/rear split. Four-wheel drive is also optional on the 248bhp A4 2.0 TFSI as well as the 187bhp A4 2.0 TDI.
Gearbox choices include a newly developed six-speed manual on all four-cylinder engines. It eschews the aluminium housing of the old unit for a new magnesium housing, which, in combination with a new differential, hollows shafts and a smaller clutch plate, helps bring a 16kg reduction in weight.
Gone is the old continuously variable Multitronic automatic gearbox. It is replaced by a revised version of the existing seven-speed dual-clutch S tronic unit, which is available for the first time on front-wheel drive A4 models and comes as standard on the least powerful of the two 3.0-litre V6 diesels. The more powerful 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine receives a standard eight-speed automatic featuring a coasting function that idles the engine on a trailing throttle for added fuel saving.  
The 2015 model-year A4 is underpinned by a newly developed suspension featuring a five-link arrangement both front and rear and either standard 16 or 17-inch wheels and tyres depending on the engine. The components for the front suspension are now made predominantly out of aluminium, reducing weight by a claimed 8kg. The adoption of the new five-link design at the rear in place of the previous trapezoidal link arrangement has saved a further 5kg. The steering is via a new speed-sensitive electro-mechanical system with a nominal 15.9:1 ratio and is claimed to be 3.5kg lighter than that used on the outgoing model.
In models from the 190bhp 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel upwards, the new A4 comes with Audi’s so-called Drive Select system as standard, allowing the driver to alter the characteristics of the throttle, steering and gearbox.
In a bid to provide the new car with broader dynamic appeal, buyers can option it with variable shock absorbers providing the choice between Comfort and Sport modes and a variable-ratio steering system. Models running quattro four-wheel drive can also be enhanced with a revised torque-vectoring function which varies the amount of drive going to each of the rear wheels in a bid to provide more neutral cornering characteristics. This so-called Sport Differential is claimed to react faster and weigh 1kg less than that offered on the fourth-generation A4.
Available in SE, Sport and S Line specifications, the new A4 will be priced from £25,900 for the 1.4-litre TFSI model. Avant models with that engine - which will go on sale in April of next year - start at £27,300. The range extends upwards to the top-level Avant 3.0 V6 TDI Quattro, which costs £40,350 when coupled with an eight-speed tiptronic transmission.

Vía Autocar RSS Feed http:\/\/ift.tt\/1FsHO4D. Dieselgate: Audi admits 2.1m of its cars are affected. Audi has finally confirmed, late last night, that it too sold cars worldwide with the ‘defeat device’ software that helped it cheat US emissions tests. 
Releasing a statement announcing that the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6 sedans, the TT roadster and the Q3 and Q5 SUVs are all affected if fitted with 1.6-litre and 2-litre turbodiesel engines. 

Audi also confirmed the majority of the cars with the cheat code are based in Western Europe, with 1.42 million vehicles located there. In the US, just 13,000 cars will be recalled because of the cheat. 

We are working at full speed to find a technical solution,"" said Audi spokesman Juergen de Graeve. 

""Once we have that solution, we will write to customers and we will upgrade the cars so that they are within emissions regulations. 

Meanwhile, Skoda also announced that 1.2 million of its cars were also affected.. VW and Audi Returning Green Car Of The Year® Awards, Vehicles Deemed Ineligible. SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. , Sept. 30, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Green Car Journal is rescinding the Green Car of the Year® awards previously honoring the 2009 VW Jetta TDI and 2010 Audi A3 TDI, the first time this has occurred in the award program's decade-long history. Audi of America President Scott Keogh has informed Green Car Journal that Audi will return its 2010 Green Car of the Year® award in the wake of Volkswagen Group's admission that it deliberately deceived government authorities about emissions from the Audi A3 TDI. Volkswagen of America has also informed Green Car Journal it will return its 2009 Green Car of the Year® award for the VW Jetta TDI. 

""Rescinding the Green Car of the Year® awards for the VW Jetta TDI and Audi A3 TDI is unfortunate but appropriate,"" said Ron Cogan , editor and publisher of the Green Car Journal and CarsOfChange.com. ""These models were selected as Green Car of the Year® above others for compelling reasons, including high fuel efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, a fun-to-drive nature, and the ability to meet 50 state emissions requirements with advanced diesel technology."" 
   
However, VW Group has now admitted that its software programming intentionally caused in-lab emissions testing to read significantly lower nitrogen oxide emissions than these vehicles actually produced on the road. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board emissions certifications used in the process of determining award eligibility were thus incorrect, and have since been declared invalid by these government agencies. This means both models would have been ineligible to be finalists in their respective award years. 

In returning its award, Audi's Keogh added that, ""Audi has won hundreds of races and thousands of awards throughout its history. But we only want to win fair and square. Therefore, in light of recent developments, we believe the only right thing to do is to return this important recognition of environmental stewardship. We are determined to compete – and hopefully win – Green Car of the Year® awards the proper way in future years."" 

The annual Green Car of the Year® award recognizes new vehicle models that best raise the bar in environmental performance. Efficiency, emissions, and overall environmental improvement are considered along with market significance, value, and widespread availability to consumers.

Today : Monday 28 September 2015 
  By Hendrik Varnholt  
FRANKFURT--Around 2.1 million Audi cars have the software that is at the center of the Volkswagen AG emissions scandal, an Audi AG spokesman said on Monday. 
 
Volkswagen, which owns most of Audi, revealed last week that software for manipulating emissions test results was installed in around 11 million diesel-powered cars. The Audi models are part of that total figure, and the cars are likely to be recalled for repairs, spokesman Jürgen De Graeve said. 
 
The vast majority of the affected Audi models, or just over 2 million cars, were sold in Europe, while around 13,000 were sold in the U.S. and Canada, Mr. De Graeve said. None of the affected vehicles were sold in China or Japan, he added. Audi said the affected models include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3, and Q5. 
 
Spanish brand Seat and Czech brand Skoda confirmed some of their models are also affected, but couldn't immediately provide information on the number of cars or models. 
 
The German government has set an Oct. 7 deadline for Volkswagen to present a plan to fix the problems, as international regulators work on more stringent emissions tests for diesel-powered vehicles. 
 
Separately, prosecutors in the German state of Lower Saxony said Monday they have opened a criminal investigation of former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down last Wednesday, and other unnamed executives on suspicion of fraud in connection with the emissions scandal. 
 
On Friday, Volkswagen tapped Matthias Müller, chief of its Porsche sports-car unit, as its new chief executive. Mr. Müller pledged a thorough internal review to rebuild trust in the company as quickly as possible. 
 
""We will be relentless in getting to the bottom of this--fast, open and as decisively as possible,"" Mr. Müller and Bernd Osterloh, head of VW's powerful works council, said in a letter to employees.

Copyright (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.. EPA says VW intentionally violates clean air standards. The Environmental Protection Agency says nearly 500,000 Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars built in the past seven year are intentionally violating clean air standards by using software that evades EPA emissions standards.. EPA Accuses VW of Violating Emissions Rules with Diesel Engines. 2009-2015 VW, Audi TDIs skirted emissions…  
The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered recall of about 482,000 Volkswagens and Audis with four-cylinder diesels as the agency investigates software-operated kill switches that circumvent emissions standards for air pollutants, specifically nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions. It issued a notice of violation (NOV) to Volkswagen AG, Audi AG and Volkswagen Group of America that could potentially lead to a recall of the cars, which include the 2009-15 Volkswagen Golf, Jetta and Beetle, 2014-15 VW Passat and 2009-15 Audi A3. 

VW Group faces potential fines of up to $18 billion for the approximately 482,000 cars sold with the 2.0-liter TDI turbocharged four-cylinder diesel, based on a per-car maximum fine of $35,500. So far, EPA has not sought an injunction to stop the sale of 2015 TDI models, though the agency adds that “it is incumbent upon Volkswagen to initiate the process that will fix the cars’ emissions systems.” 

“Every automaker has to meet the same standard,” said Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator for the EPA Office of Air & Radiation. “These cars are up to 90 percent cleaner because of the standard.” 

Owners of the 482,000 cars do not have to take action until receiving a recall notice, and the cars are safe and legal to operate in the meantime, the EPA added. 

The investigation began when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) “was engaged in dialogue with our European counterparts concerning high in use emissions from light duty diesels,” CARB, which has its own testing lab, said in a letter to VW Group of America’s legal counsel. “CARB deployed a number of efforts using portable measurement systems and other approaches to increase our understanding for the California fleet. In 2014, the International Council for Clean Transportation and West Virginia University identified through their test program, and brought to CARB’s and [EPA’s] attention, concerns of elevated NOx emissions over real world driving.” 

“It’s no secret that California has unique challenges when it comes to air quality,” CARB board executive officer Richard Corey said in a press conference call with EPA officials Friday. NOx “cooks ozone.” It can cause asthma and other illnesses, the EPA’s McCabe said. 

Corey said the European agency tipped off CARB about the problem, and that VW has admitted a “defect.” “This appears to be a very serious violation,” he added. 

VW Group of America acknowledged the investigation in a statement released Friday. “VW is cooperating with the investigation; we are unable to comment further at this time,” the company said through a spokesman. 

Corey declined to comment on the potential moti…. VW emissions scandal threatens more models, rival carmakers. THE Volkswagen and Audi diesel emissions scandal which has thrown the global car industry into turmoil has spread to Europe and threatens to embroil more models and rival carmakers. 
 
The chief executive of Volkswagen AG, the parent company of Porsche, Seat, Skoda, Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti as well as VW and Audi, was fighting for his career, after it emerged the firm had fitted 11m vehicles worldwide with a ""defeat device"" designed to cheat emissions tests. 
 
The Independent can reveal that the EA189 engines at the centre of the emissions scandal had also been fitted to several Skoda and Seat models sold in the UK, as well as the VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models and the Audi A3 at the centre of the scandal in the US. 
 
According to a source at VW in the UK the firm is rushing to establish the number of models involved. They said: ""We are currently investigating which models are affected and what this means for UK [and European] customers,"" they said. 
 
This came after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has recalled nearly 500,000 cars in US, said it was considering expanding its review of the car giant to cover a range of luxury models manufactured by VW, including the high-end Porsche Cayenne SUV and the Audi Q5, A6, A7 and A8 models. 
 
By the afternoon of 22 September, the scandal, which originated in California on 18 September, had spread across Europe and in Britain the Department for Transport called for an EU-wide investigation. ""It's vital that the public has confidence in vehicle emissions tests and I am calling for the European Commission to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency,"" Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said. 
 
A spokesman for the commission said it was ""premature"" to comment on whether there would be a European investigation into VW, which is the largest carmaker in the EU and a central pillar of the German economy. 
 
The world's largest car makers is now facing a major criminal probe by US Justice Department and could face up to £11.7bn in fines under an EPA probe set up last week. 
 
The British call for an EU-wide investigation and the revelation that more vehicles could be affected came after German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded ""full transparency"" and regulators from Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic and the Netherlands have all either launched formal investigations or expressed alarm. 
 
In a video statement posted online, VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn apologised for the scandal, only hours after the firm was forced to deny reports that he would be stepping down on 18 September. He said: ""Swift and comprehensive clarification has now the utmost priority. To make it very clear: manipulation at VW must never happen again."" 
 
He was speaking after the firm admitted it had already set aside £4.7bn for product recalls as its shares dropped by almost 20 per cent on 22 September. Since Monday £18bn, or a third, has been wiped off the value of the car giant. 
 
The fate of the 68-year-old chief executive will be on the agenda at a meeting of VW's supervisory governing committee on Tuesday.. Any recommendation that committee makes will be presented to the full 20-member VW board due to meet at a later date. 
 
The revelation was one factor in a market slump as investors feared the scandal could spread beyond VW, amid suggestions the firm had used a software fix to avoid a costly engineering fix for its dirty diesel engines. 
 
Environmental campaigners have long been critical of Germany's enforcement standards on the big car makers that drive its export economy. The EU has been working to tighten testing rules but has been battled by manufactures that are known to manipulate existing tests. 
 
In a statement the carmaker maintained that all new diesel vehicles available in the EU ""comply with legal requirement and environmental standards."". EPA Says VW Intentionally Violates Clean Air Standards. The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday ordered Volkswagen to fix nearly 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars that the agency said are intentionally violating clean air laws by using software that evades EPA emissions standards. 
 
VW, which owns Audi, faces billions of dollars in fines, although exact amounts were not determined.. Shape-Shifting Mercedes, Luxury Electrics, Is.... The VW diesel emission scandal continues to unfold, with more cars to be investigated and questions about the future of diesel not only in the U.S. but globally. 

And we've got a shape-shifting concept car and a B&B with solar-powered electric-car charging. All this and more on Green Car Reports. 

If you're a small B&B, what angle can you use to set yourself apart? How about solar-powered electric-car charging? 

The EPA plans not only to retest Audi and Porsche diesels as well as the Volkswagen ones already identified, but ultimately, every single diesel vehicle sold in the U.S. 

German makers are getting serious about electric cars; the Frankfurt Motor Show offered rumors of an electric platform shared by Audi and Porsche. 

Also at Frankfurt, Mercedes-Benz showed a concept car that changes its shape to reduce aerodynamic drag. 

A followup to a landmark 2007 study confirms, once again, that electric cars cut energy use and reduce carbon emissions. 

We have to ask it: Is diesel dead? If they're banned in Paris, what's next? 

That Apple car that's supposedly coming in 2019 will be a disaster, says GM's former product czar. 

Finally, SUVs get smaller and smaller: We have spy shots of a future Audi Q2. What happens below Q0? 

_______________________________________________ 

Follow GreenCarReports on. Audi's 'Truth in Engineering' brand promise is a cautionary tale. Martin Winterkorn, the CEO of Volkswagen, resigned on Wednesday, in the wake of the widening scandal over faked emissions testing. The company admitted to installing software designed to evade air pollution standards in nearly half a million cars in the U.S. (and potentially 11 million cars worldwide).

One of Volkswagen's brands is Audi, which aired an unfortunately-timed advertisement during the Emmy Awards featuring the tagline, “ Truth in Engineering.”

Audi's ""Truth in Engineering"" ad campaign…. VW's 'clean diesel' strategy unraveled by outside emissions tests. DETROIT •  When the International Council for Clean Transportation commissioned researchers at West Virginia University to test diesel car emissions in 2013, the group expected to find that diesel cars sold in the U.S. emitted fewer pollutants than cars sold elsewhere because they had to meet tougher standards, ICCT officials told Reuters on Monday. 

Instead, after testing a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta and a 2013 VW Passat, researchers were ""surprised"" when the results showed the opposite: the two VW models displayed much higher levels of nitrogen oxide emissions than permitted by law, while a third test vehicle, a BMW X5, generally fell within permissible limits. 

""Our hypothesis was these cars would all come out clean,"" said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the ICCT, a nonprofit independent research group with offices in Washington, San Francisco and Berlin. 

In May 2014, ICCT alerted the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board about their findings. On Friday, EPA said VW could be liable for up to $18 billion in penalties for using software on almost 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars that circumvented emissions regulations, unleashing a controversy that threatens long-term damage to VW's finances, leadership and reputation. 

VW shares in Europe fell almost 20 percent on Monday, and the company suspended U.S. sales of its diesel cars until it can come up with a fix to satisfy regulators. The disclosure comes as VW's U.S. sales have lagged the company's performance in other global markets, and could hamper its efforts to boost demand in the American market. 

Industry experts said the scandal could hit VW hard, just as it was emerging from a damaging leadership battle. VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said on Sunday he was ""deeply sorry"" for the breach of U.S. rules and ordered an investigation. People including a VW supervisory board member said Winterkorn may have to resign. 

The concerns raised by ICCT ""prompted CARB to start an investigation and discussions"" with VW in 2014, CARB said. Nitrogen oxide emissions have been linked to smog and acid rain. 

VW agreed to conduct its own tests to replicate the ICCT study, proposed a software fix to CARB. 

'CLEAN DIESEL' 

VW has been airing TV commercials lauding its ""clean diesel"" cars for several years, including ads that ran last November, even as the company was aware of the emissions controversy. VW on Monday said there was no intention to misinform the public with its clean diesel ads. 

In December, VW issued a voluntary recall of all its U.S. diesel cars from model years 2009-2014. 

The recall didn't end the matter. CARB, in cooperation with EPA, said it wanted to do ""confirmatory"" tests, and it ran those beginning in May 2015. In July, CARB notified VW that the test vehicles still showed emissions that exceeded state and federal limits. California shared those results with federal regulators. 

VW attributed the excess emissions to ""various technical issues"" and ""unexpected"" real-world conditions. 

It wasn't until EPA and CARB threatened to withhold certification for the automaker's 2016 diesel models that VW in early September revised its explanation. 

""Only then did VW admit it had designed and installed a defeat device in these vehicles in the form of a sophisticated software algorithm that detected when a vehicle was undergoing emissions testing,"" the EPA said in its Sept. 18 letter to VW. 

The EPA on Friday said that it ""intends to compel VW to issue a recall"" once the automaker has developed a satisfactory fix. But as of mid-day Monday, company and EPA officials said there was no recall. 

VW executives were scheduled to unveil the 2016 Passat — including a ""clean diesel"" version — in New York City on Monday evening. The company late Monday said the 2016 Passat diesel has not yet been certified for the U.S. by the EPA.  . The Audi SQ5 TDI plus with 250 kW 340 hp. The SQ5 TDI plus will launch on the German market in October 2015  700 Nm of torque; from 0 to 100 km\/h in 5.1 seconds  On request, exclusive equipment package from quattro GmbH   

 
Audi is further expanding its range of S models. In October, the new SQ5 TDI plus* will arrive at German dealerships with more power and driving pleasure and even more extensive equipment – with 250 kW (340 hp), sport differential and 21-inch wheels. 
 
Even in its basic version, the successful Audi SQ5 TDI* comes as an SUV with the performance of a sports car. The plus version has an even higher power output. The biturbo V6 TDI produces 250 kW (340 hp) from its three liters of displacement by way of increased injection pressure. This results in 20 kW\/27 hp more power compared to the SQ5 TDI. Its peak torque is increased by 50 (36.9 lb-ft) to 700 Nm (516.3 lb-ft). The powerful diesel SUV accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h (62.1 mph) in just 5.1 seconds; the top speed is electronically governed to 250 km\/h (155.3 mph). In the NECD cycle, it merely requires 6.6 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers (35.6 US mpg) with emission of 174 g CO2\/km (280.0 g\/mi). 
 
Like all S models from Audi, the SQ5 TDI plus delivers its power to the road via the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. For the first time in the Q5 family, a sport differential at the rear axle actively distributes the drive power to the wheels. The SUV comes with gloss black 21-inch cast aluminum wheels in 5-twin-spoke star design from Audi Sport with size 255\/40 R21 tires. 
 
Audi has extended the standard black gloss package to include the exterior mirror housing, the door handles, the roof edge spoiler and the diffuser. A further visual customization feature on the exterior are two clasps that join the four exhaust tailpipes in pairs. Inside, the sliding rear seat bench increases variability and enlarges the luggage compartment, if necessary. The armrests in the door trims are upholstered in leather. The fine Nappa leather seat covers feature a diamond pattern in silver. 
 
In addition to these features, quattro GmbH has put together the special equipment package “Audi exclusive selection macaw blue”, which is limited to 100 units, for the SQ5 TDI plus. The body is painted in the customized color macaw blue, crystal effect and the interior comes with sport seats in black fine Nappa leather. Matching the exterior color, the macaw blue contrasting stitching on the seats, the steering wheel, the selector lever gaiter and the floor mats provides colorful highlights. The inlays in aluminum\/Beaufort, black, round out the overall concept. The exclusive equipment package can be ordered at launch from a price of €12,000 in the SQ5 TDI plus. 
 
The Audi SQ5 TDI plus costs €67,700 in Germany. 
 
Fuel consumption of the models named above: 
 Audi SQ5 TDI plus:   Combined fuel consumption in l\/100 km: 6.7 – 6.6 (35.1 – 35.6 US mpg)**;  Combined CO2 emissions in g\/km: 177– 174 (284.9 – 280.0 g\/mi)**   Audi SQ5 TDI:   Combined fuel consumption in l\/100 km: 6.6 (35.6 US mpg);  Combined CO2 emissions in g\/km: 174 (280.0 g\/mi)

MARKET SNAPSHOT: U.S. Stocks Dragged Lower By Global Growth Worries. U.S. stocks slumped in Monday trade as concerns about slowing economic growth in China and  mixed domestic economic reports made investors jittery. 
 

  A raft of U.S. data, including a gauge of pending home sales, and scheduled speeches from several Federal Reserve members helped keep traders on edge. 
 

  ""I think what we have here is a continuation of the selling we say on Friday,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-founder and co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, pointing to a sharp selloff that gripped markets toward the end of Friday's trading session that was pegged to weakness in biotech and health-care stocks. 
 

  Indeed, the health-care sector, off 1.6%, was among the hardest hit of the S&P 500's 10 sectors on Monday. 
 

  The S&P 500  fell 23 points, or 1.2%, to 1,907, with the materials sector, down 2.4%, leading declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 151 points, or  about 1%, to 16,162. S&P 500 component Alcoa Inc.(AA) jumped 4.4% after the aluminum-producing giant said it plans to split into two (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/alcoa-to-split-into-two-publicly-traded-companies-shares-jump-56-2015-09-28) publicly listed companies. 
 

  The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 81 points, or 1.8%, to 4,606, also was being dragged lower by a downdraft in the biotech sector. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB), a measure of the biotech's performance, sank 3.8% Monday after suffering its worst weekly decline in about seven years on Friday (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/ibb-biotech-fund-on-track-for-biggest-weekly-decline-in-7-years-2015-09-25). 
 

  The drop followed another round of weak data from China (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/china-august-industrial-profits-fall-88-on-year-2015-09-28) on Monday. The country's industrial profits in August fell 8.8% from a year ago, underscoring concerns that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing faster than expected. 
 

  ""Investors returning to the market with a renewed sense of confidence have had their bubble burst once again as Chinese economic data continues to disappoint,"" said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, in a note. 
 

  European markets also dropped (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/european-stocks-wrapped-in-red-as-china-growth-fears-linger-2015-09-28), with the Stoxx Europe 600 index  off 1.2%, while Asian markets closed mixed (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/storyno-meta-for-guid). 
 

  Data and Fed speakers: A packed data calendar on Monday could help gauge the impact of China's slowing on the U.S. economy. 
 

  A gauge of pending home sales fell to its lowest level in five months, which points to hesitation from buyers amid rising prices, talk of rates being increased and a dearth of homes on the sales block. Pending home sales for August fell 1.4% (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/us-pending-home-sales-fall-in-august-to-five-month-low-2015-09-28). 
 

  Spending on cars and back-to-school purchases helped bolster purchases at retailers, but a closely watched measure of inflation by the Federal Reserve--the so-called PCE index--showed little sign of moving toward the Fed's target 2% level (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/consumer-spending-rises-04-in-august-pce-inflation-flat-2015-09-28). 
 

  There is also busy lineup of Fed speakers. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to give a speech on monetary policy at Marquette University Business Leaders Forum in Milwaukee, Wis., at 1 p.m. Eastern. Evans is a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year. 
 

  San Francisco Fed President John Williams, also a voting member, is due to talk about the economic outlook at the UCLA Anderson Forecast Center in Los Angeles at 5 p.m. Eastern. 
 

  Earlier on Monday, Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo gave a speech on capital regulation across financial intermediaries (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/feds-tarullo-signals-change-to-insurer-regulation-2015-09-28) at a Bank of France conference.

It comes after Williams and Williams Partners said they were terminating a previously announced merger pact. 
 

  Shares of Energy Transfer Equity slumped more than 9%, while Williams slid 6%. 
 

  U.S.-listed shares of Volkswagen AG(VOW.XE) dropped more than 7% after German prosecutors opened a fraud investigation (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/fraud-probe-opened-on-volkswagen-ex-ceo-winterkorn-2015-09-28) into former CEO Martin Winterkorn. Earlier, Audi said 2.1 million of its vehicles have the emissions-rigging software installed, and the German motor authority gave VW until Monday to come up with a plan to fix affected cars. 
 

  U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk AS(NOVO-B.KO) climbed 2.8% after the Food and Drug Administration approved the Danish drug maker's long-acting Tresiba insulin product.

Copyright (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.. Urgent: 2.1 million Audi cars affected by emissions cheating scandal. The German car maker Audi said on Monday that a total of 2.1 million Audi cars were affected by the emissions cheating scandal. Endit. About two million rigged VW engines were made at Hungary Audi plant: minister. BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About 2 million of the 11 million diesel engines involved in the Volkswagen emissions scandal were manufactured at an Audi plant in western Hungary, Economy Minister Mihaly Varga told private broadcaster TV2 on Tuesday.

Varga also said the government was in talks with Audi as well as German rival Daimler's premium brand Mercedes, which also has a big factory in Hungary, to assess the potential impact on the local economy.

(Reporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Miral Fahmy). Bullion Erases Sept' Gain as Base Metal Miners Crash, 'Strong Signals' of Lehmans-Style Financial Crisis. BULLION prices fell sharply in London trade Monday, cutting 1.4% off gold and 3.8% off silver as Western stock markets dropped and base metals sank with crude oil prices. 
 
Dropping to $1130 and $14.54 per ounce respectively as the Dollar edged higher on the FX market, gold and silver bullion both erased last week's late gains, retreating to their levels from the start of this month. 
 
Platinum fell harder again as VW-owned automaker Audi said 2.1 million of its diesel cars worldwide are fitted with the same testing software used by its parent to cheat US emissions tests. 
 
Trading down to new 6.5-year lows, platinum prices also extended their discount below gold prices to a new 3-year record. 
 Base metals giant Anglo American (LON:AAL) meantime sank to its lowest price since floating on the stock market in 1999, while Swiss mining and commodities trading group Glencore (LON:GLEN) sank 29% to new all-time lows – valuing it at 26 pence in the pound compared with the 2011 float – as a new report from South African investment bank Investec said its “gearing” of debt-to-shareholder-equity has reached above 300%, some 7 times its peer group average.  
“Although I can expect temporary weakness in gold – the sort we saw during Lehman crisis,” says one bullion bank's sales desk in a note, “a large move up [of $100-130] could happen intra-day.” 
 
Confessing that “the gold bug in me has bitten quite hard,” the note points to “strong signals from global markets” including confusion over the US Fed's much-delayed “lift-off” from zero, the slowdown in economic growth, and “exhaustion” in the US high-yield corporate bond market – “a leading indicator of further investor deleveraging in the broader markets…[now threatening] a break down…to a repeat of Lehman crisis levels.” 
 
“Gold's improvement [is] only technical so far,” counters Chinese-owned ICBC Standard Bank in a precious metals note, pointing to last week's loss of “momentum” in the gold chart's long-term downtrend. 
 
Looking at the latest data from US regulators, “short-covering” by bearish traders closing their bets after the Federal Reserve's no change decision on US interest rates “started the turn…powering the initial recovery,” Standard Bank goes on. 
 
“ETF flows appeared to be the main driver of the pop up to $1155 last Thursday.” 
 
The giant SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEArca:GLD) last week added to the gold bullion held to back its shares 4 days running – the longest stretch of growth since September 2012. 
 
End-2012 saw the GLD peak by holdings at 1354 tonnes – almost twice Friday's level of 684 tonnes. 
 
At its peak by value in late 2011, the GLD was the world's largest ETF, overtaking the US equity market's S&P500 fund and worth some $75 billion. 
 
Wholesale bullion trading in China – now the world's No.1 gold mining, importing and consumer nation – was meantime quiet overnight ahead of Thursday's week-long National Day shutdown. 
 Three days after Bloomberg said 5 banks – none of whom own vaulting facilities in London – are pushing with the mining-backed World Gold Council for a move to exchange-traded contracts in the world's wholesale bullion market, Swiss competition regulators said today they're investigating claims of “collusion” between 6 other banks regarding the “spread” they quote between buying and selling prices in gold..

 Audi, Porsche R&D chiefs, VW US CEO to quit. Audi says 2.1 million cars affected by diesel emission scandal. BERLIN - Audi said 2.1 million cars worldwide were fitted with the software that allowed parent Volkswagen to cheat U.S. emission tests. 

Some 1.42 million Audi vehicles with so-called EU5 engines are affected in Western Europe, with 577,000 in Germany and almost 13,000 in the United States, a spokesman for Ingolstadt-based Audi said on Monday. 
  
Affected model lines include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5, the spokesman said. 

VW said last week around 11 million cars of its group brands worldwide are affected by the diesel emissions scandal. REUTERS. EPA accuses VW of cheating on emission rules. Diesel cars from Volkswagen and Audi cheated on clean air rules by including software that made the cars' emissions look cleaner than they actually were, according to federal and California regulators. 
 
The regulators say that the software on the cars turns up emission controls only when it detects that the car was being tested. 

""The effectiveness of these vehicles' pollution emissions control devices is greatly reduced during all normal driving situations,"" said the Environmental Protection Agency's notice to the company. ""This results in cars that meet emissions standards in the laboratory or testing station, but during normal operation, emit nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the standard."" 

There are nearly 500,000 of these diesel cars on U.S. roads. The models include the VW Jetta, the Beetle and the Golf from model years 2009 through 2015, the Passat from 2014-2015 as well as the Audi A3, model years 2009-2015. The Audi luxury brand is owned by Volkswagen Group. 

Owners of the affected cars do not face health risks, according to the EPA, and can to continue to drive or sell them. But the EPA has ordered VW to recall the cars and fix the violation. No recall has yet been announced. 

Representatives from EPA and the California Air Resources Board, which did the testing that uncovered the problem, would not say whether a change to the software would have a negative impact on the cars' performance or the fuel economy. 

Volkwagen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The EPA did not say how much VW would ultimately be fined for this infraction.

See full bio Comments More From CNET. Dieselgate News: 2.1 mill Audi and 1.2 mil Skoda cars are affected worldwide. Audi confirmed that more than two million cars already sold worldwide have installed the software that fools emission testing. A quarter of them were bought by German clients. Skoda officials confirmed the existence of 1.2 million cars worldwide that are equipped with engines that are in the same situation.
DIESELGATE Audi – 2.1 million cars affected Once the Volkswagen Group announced last week that 11 million cars of its brands “benefits” from the contribution of the illegal software that detects and manipulates the official tests of emissions and consumption, we find that this figure included 2.1 million Audi models sold worldwide. According to statistics provided by the Ingolstadt brand, of which 1.42 million cars were sold in Western Europe, reaching 577,000 German customers. Overall, 13,000 units of Audi affected by the incriminated software were sold in the US, the country that started the scandal that led to the resignation of Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of the Volkswagen Group. In the list of affected models included different TDI engines are Euro 5 models mounted on A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q5 and Q3 and sold between 2008 and 2015. According to preliminary official information, Euro 6 engines on existing models of the  German brand are not included in this situation. DIESELGATE Skoda – 1.2 million cars affected Of the 11 million cars in the Volkswagen Group portfolio that are equipped with a program for manipulating official tests of emissions and consumption, 1.2 million Skoda units are equipped with the incriminated TDI engine. The Czech brand sold these vehicles globally and has fewer cars affected by the future recall than has been prepared by the Volkswagen Group. For example, in the case of Volkswagen, we are talking about 5 million cars equipped with the system that allows the drive from the engine to detect it tested for emissions and consumption and applying a map injection specifically for this circumstances. DIEELGATE Seat – still no comments Seat is the last brand of the Volkswagen Group that uses the incriminated diesel engines and has not yet announced what will be the number of vehicles affected by this service recall. Given that volume brand in Martorell use diesel engines developed and manufactured by Volkswagen, it is only a matter of time until he announced the number of vehicles affected by this situation. DIEELGATE Porsche – not affected Porsche, which offers a V6 TDI engine, were delimited by this situation since September 23, when they stated that the “Dieselgate” scandal doesn’t affect the Porsche models equipped with diesel engines. “Porsche conduct their own tests and calibration emissions. We are not affected by the Volkswagen problem,” said a Porsche spokesman.. Frankfurt: Lights, cameras, technology!.

Amid all the predictions of European momentum -- as represented by 90-some new-vehicle introductions -- all anyone wanted to talk about was who wasn't here.
Krueger, having recovered from his dizzy spell, got a clean bill of health from his doctors and was sent to Munich. Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne skipped the show altogether to pull off a new UAW labor contract in Detroit. Former VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech didn't make the IAA for the first time since the invention of the Beetle (well, nearly). And although there were whispers of an Elon Musk sighting, his Tesla Model X SUV was nowhere to be found. Frankfurt was missing something. Or was it? Years from now when we reflect on Frankfurt 2015, memories may be less about absent players than about an industry that could finally talk in the present tense about technology. The likes of Apple, Google and Uber may have been absent from the 33 football fields of Frankfurt floor space, but they were very much part of the conversation. And the ""disrupters,"" as they are being labeled, are shaking up a traditional industry. ""Frenemies"" is how Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche referred to the disrupters shortly after Mercedes showed off an intelligent aerodynamic car that extends an aero tail as it increases speed. Talk about a ride straight outta Silicon Valley. And one by one, intro by intro, automakers showed that although they're late to the tech party, they now belong in the room. Autonomous technology was displayed next to in-vehicle apps demonstrated in high-powered, long-range electrics. For an industry called too blasé about tech adoption, it was a virtual coming-out party.Volkswagen Group proudly proclaimed that within a couple of Frankfurt shows, its vehicles will be ""technology on wheels."" Then VW backed it up with world-class intros including an electropowered Audi e-tron quattro, which should make Musk nervous when it launches in 2018. 
Audi r&d chief Ulrich Hackenberg called it the ""benchmark for future automotive technologies,"" and Audi promised that more are on the way. Porsche followed with its Mission E. BMW talked about development of ""robot cars."" 
The newly launched 7 series has lines of code in the vehicle that are ""mind-blowing,"" said Ian Robertson, BMW's board member for sales and marketing. 
""Maybe the question is: How capable is the auto industry of being more engaged in the IT industry?"" Robertson said. ""I think very capable."" 
Seven automakers displayed cars with Android Auto. Even more talked about the industry's transformation. 
And maybe that's the real symbol of how far this industry has come. The disrupter threat is real, but it's also now part of the executive lexicon. 
And that list includes one leader who was here -- a first-timer to the IAA in her current role. She not only showed up but offered her own tech crystal ball that said as much about General Motors as it did the industry as a whole.
""We will see more change in the industry in the next five to 10 years,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said, ""than we have in the last 50."" 
It seems the industry is finally ready.You can reach Jason Stein at jstein@crain.com. -- Follow Jason on Tags: Frankfurt Motor showTechnologyBMWDaimlerVehicle TechnologyGoogleAppleUber advertising  Print Reprints RespondHave an opinion about this story?

CARS: A brand-by-brand look at new 2016 models. DETROIT - The 2016 model year has plenty of workhorses, including new versions of the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Titan pickups, Chevrolet Malibu and Kia Optima sedans and the Honda Civic small car. 

But it also has some sparkling show horses. Ford, Audi, Ferrari and Acura all have new supercars. Cadillac is launching the racetrack-ready CTS-V. Dodge is unleashing its fastest Viper ever, and Lamborghini has amped up the power in its Aventador. Drivers with a smaller budget can also have a lot of fun in the new Ford GT350, Audi TT or Mazda MX-5 Miata. 

Hyper luxury is in: Bentley is releasing its first SUV and Mercedes has a $189,350 Maybach version of its S-Class sedan with its own fragrance system. The new top-of-the-line Range Rover SVAutobiography starts at just under $200,000. 

Carmakers haven't completely forgotten about fuel economy. Many are using more aluminum and high-strength steel to drop weight and improve fuel economy. The new Audi Q7 SUV is 717 pounds lighter than the previous version, while the new Chevrolet Camaro is up to 300 pounds lighter. 

Toyota is introducing a new Prius hybrid and a hydrogen fuel cell car, the Mirai, which will be sold in California. Hyundai is releasing a hybrid version of the Sonata sedan. Chevrolet has a new Volt hybrid that goes for 53 miles on battery power alone, and Mercedes, Audi and BMW have new plug-in hybrids. 

Here are new or significantly refreshed cars and trucks coming in the 2016 model year, by brand: 

___ 

ACURA 

ILX: The small sports sedan gets a significant freshening with a new 2.4-litre direct-injected four-cylinder engine that puts out 201 horsepower. It's linked to an eight-speed dual clutch transmission. It also gets new front and rear styling with jeweled LED headlights, as well as better noise insulation and thicker door glass. Went on sale in February. Starts at $27,900 excluding shipping. 

RDX: Midsize lux SUV is refreshed with a new, more powerful 3.5-litre V6 engine that puts out 279 horsepower. The RDX gets updated, rounder styling and jeweled LED headlights. Starts at $35,270 without shipping. Went on sale in April. 

MDX: Luxury people-hauler with three rows of seats gets a new nine-speed automatic transmission and a top-end luxury trim line. Went on sale in February starting at $42,865 excluding shipping. 

NSX: Acura's build-to-order supercar is all new with a 550-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-litre V6 and a three-electric-motor sport hybrid system. The mid-mounted engine is mated to a new nine-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. The NSX also comes with a multi-material frame that keeps it rigid but lightweight with crisp handling, Acura says. The all-wheel-drive supercar also gets a sleeker design with 10 air-cooled heat exchangers for the powertrain. Due out in the spring with a starting price of about $155,000. 

___ 

AUDI 

A3 SPORTBACK E-TRON: This is the first plug-in hybrid Audi to hit the market. The five-seat wagon combines a 1.4-litre, four-cylinder gasoline engine and an electric motor powered by a battery hidden under the rear seats. It can be driven in electric mode for up to 19 miles; in hybrid mode, the car decides whether to use the motor, the gas engine or a combination of the two. Fuel economy numbers haven't yet been released. Recharging through a 120-volt outlet takes eight hours; recharging through a 240-volt outlet takes two hours and 15 minutes. Home installation of a 240-volt outlet and home charging station is optional. The Sportback e-tron goes on sale in October starting at $37,900. 

A6\/A7: Audi's A6 midsize sedan, last redesigned in 2011, gets some significant updates. The front and rear have a taut new design and there are new LED headlights and a wider grille. The A6 has a new, more powerful base engine: a 2.0-litre four-cylinder with 252 horsepower, up from 220 horsepower in the previous model. The front-wheel-drive version is paired with a new, seven-speed transmission, while the all-wheel-drive quattro version has an eight-speed transmission. Both the A6 and its sibling, the coupe-like A7, also get a new 3.0-litre V6 engine option with 333 horsepower, up 23 horsepower from the previous model. Inside, there's a new wireless hotspot for up to eight devices in the car. There are also new safety features, including night vision with animal detection. The 2016 A6 and A7 went on sale this spring; the A6 starts at $46,200, the A7 at $68,300. 

TT: The third generation TT coupe has a sportier, more muscular design and new LED headlights. Audi used more high-strength steel and aluminum to make the new TT lighter and stiffer. The TT coupe and roadster have a 2.0-litre, turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 220 horsepower; the sporty TTS coupe gets a turbocharged four-cylinder with 292 horsepower. Both are paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. Inside, there's a fully digital instrument cluster and the most advanced version of Audi's infotainment system, which reads newspaper headlines and Twitter alerts and can access more than 7,000 Web radio stations. The 2016 TT went on sale this summer, starting at $42,900. 

Q7: This is Audi's first full redesign of its three-row, seven-seat SUV in nearly a decade. It has a shorter, leaner, more wagon-like look than its predecessor. Audi managed to shave 717 pounds off the Q7 by using more lightweight materials; the doors, engine hood and rear hatch are all made of aluminum. Audi says the weight savings help make the Q7 26 per cent more fuel efficient. U.S. buyers have three engine choices: a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder rated at 252 horsepower; a 3.0-litre turbodiesel with 272 horsepower; or a 3.0-litre supercharged V6 with 333 horsepower. Inside, the Q7 will be Audi's first vehicle that lets drivers access certain smartphone apps through Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto. The Q7 goes on sale early next year. Pricing hasn't been announced, but the current Q7 starts at $48,300. 

R8: The second generation of Audi's R8 supercar has a racier, more chiseled look and a top speed of 200.7 miles per hour. It can go from 0 to 62 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds. Thanks to new construction with more extensive aluminum and carbon fiber, the R8 is 110 pounds lighter than the outgoing model. The V10 mid-engine comes in two variants: one with 540 horsepower and 398 pound-feet of torque and one with 610 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. The second is Audi's fastest and most powerful series-production Audi ever. An electric version, the R8 e-tron, is also available. It has a range of nearly 280 miles, up from 133 miles in the outgoing model. The R8 is already on sale in Europe, starting at $180,980. The U.S. sale date hasn't been announced. 

___ 

BENTLEY 

BENTAYGA: Bentley's first SUV — named for a rugged peak in the Canary Islands — goes on sale early next year. It has an aluminum body and a frame of aluminum and high-strength steel, a Bentley first. It's powered by a 12-cylinder engine, which Bentley says will make it the fastest production SUV in the world. Pricing hasn't been announced, but it's likely to be north of its nearest competitor, the $138,000 Range Rover Autobiography. 

___ 

BMW 

3 SERIES: The 340i high-performance variant of BMW's most popular line gets a new inline 3-Liter six-cylinder twin turbo that puts out 320 horsepower, 20 better than the current model. There's also the new 330e plug-in hybrid that can go 22 miles on battery power and puts out 250 horsepower. Otherwise, the small BMW sedans and sport wagons get a freshening with a retuned chassis, revamped electric power steering and sportier fronts. Sale date and pricing not announced yet. 340i goes on sale in the fall. Pricing hasn't been revealed. 

7 SERIES: The all-new flagship large sedan gets up to 190 pounds lighter and comes with an improved ride and better handling. BMW says it used a lot of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic in the passenger area to help shed the weight. In the U.S. it comes as a 740i and 750i xDrive. The 750i gets a revamped 4.4-litre V8 engine with 445 horsepower. 740i gets latest generation 3-litre inline turbocharged six with 320 hp. Plug-in hybrid 740e coming next year. Can go 23 miles on battery power alone. The 740i starts at $81,300 without shipping, while the 750i xDrive starts at $97,400. Both are available in the fall. 

X1: New for 2016, the small SUV gets a roomier interior, more space for cargo and a new 2-litre twin-turbo four-cylinder engine that puts out 228 horsepower. It's mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. BMW says a new chassis enhances handling and ride comfort over the current model. New version is 1.7 inches taller than the old one. Goes on sale in the fall. Price hasn't been released. 

X5: BMW's first plug-in hybrid SUV joins the lineup, the X5 xDrive40e. The midsize SUV can go 13 miles on battery power and zero to 60 in 6.5 seconds. It comes with a 2-litre twin-turbo four-cylinder gas engine plus an electric motor. Combined, they put out 308 horsepower. Available in the fall. Price not yet announced. 

___ 

BUICK 

CASCADA: Buick goes for a little ragtop bling with the Cascada, an American version of a stylish Opel convertible from Europe. The four-seater is the brand's first convertible in a quarter-century, and it comes with a turbocharged 200-horsepower engine, and a safety system that deploys rollover protection bars behind the rear seats if the car detects that a crash is possible. The insulated soft top can be opened in 17 seconds while travelling up to 31 miles per hour. Price hasn't been released yet. The convertible is due in showrooms early next year. 

___ 

CADILLAC 

ATS-V: High-performance version of Caddy's small sports sedan and coupe. Comes with a 3.6-litre twin-turbo engine that puts out 464 horsepower and the choice of eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmissions. Sedan starts at $60,465, the coupe at $62,665, both excluding shipping. Already on sale. 

CTS-V: It's a new iteration of the racetrack-ready CTS based on the lighter and leaner new version of the midsize sports car. It's the most powerful car in Cadillac's 112-year history with a 640-horsepower supercharged 6.2-litre V8 mated to an eight-speed automatic tranny. Starts at $83,995 without shipping. On sale now. 

CT6: Cadillac goes back to its roots with a new rear-drive luxury land yacht that isn't supposed to behave like one. The CT6 has an aluminum-intensive body with 11 different materials for strength, performance and efficiency. GM says it's lighter than the smaller BMW 5-Series. Buyers can choose from a new 3-litre twin-turbo V6 with 400 horsepower, plus two less-powerful engines from the previous generation. Night vision that helps identify people and large animals with heat signatures on a dashboard display. Pricing hasn't been announced. On sale early next year. 

XT5: The first of the new generation of GM sport utilities is a replacement for the aging SRX midsize SUV. GM will release details later this year. 

___ 

CHEVROLET 

CAMARO: The classic Chevy muscle car slims down to fit on the frame of a Cadillac ATS small sports sedan. And it gets something that's almost unheard of in a muscle car: a standard four-cylinder engine. The sixth-generation Camaro loses 200 to 300 pounds over the 2015 model, and it's also shorter. And the new turbocharged 2-litre four is nothing to be embarrassed about. It puts out 275 horsepower, more than many V8s from years ago. But buyers also can choose a 335-horsepower V6 or 455-horsepower 6.2-litre V8 engine. Starts at $26,695, excluding shipping. Due in showrooms in the fall. 

CRUZE: Chevy's now 5-year-old pedestrian-looking compact car is replaced with a more stylish, aerodynamic-looking sedan that's longer and 250 pounds lighter. GM engineers say the new Cruze addresses the faults of the old one, which had a noisy underpowered engine, a cramped back seat and bland styling. Gone are two older four-cylinder engines, both with 138 horsepower. They're replaced by an all-new 153-horsepower 1.4-litre turbo four. Six-speed manual is standard and a new six-speed automatic is available. It's due in showrooms in the spring. Price hasn't been announced. 

MALIBU: General Motors makes another run at the popular midsize car segment. But if the sleeker and lighter new Malibu runs and handles as well as it looks, Chevy might make a dent in the market now controlled mainly by Honda and Toyota. The new sedan has a wide stance and a coupe-like look that's lower than the old version for better aerodynamics. A longer wheelbase creates more room inside the redesigned model, including 1.3 inches of additional rear-seat legroom. Comes standard with a new 1.5-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 160 horsepower. It's smaller and lighter than the previous four-cylinder, helping to cut 300 pounds of weight. GM says highway mileage will rise 1 mpg to 37. There's also a turbocharged 2-litre four-cylinder with 250 horsepower and an eight-speed automatic transmission. A gas-electric hybrid version gets an estimated 48 mpg in combined city and highway driving. Gasoline versions available in December and hybrid in the spring. Pricing not announced. 

SPARK: The Korean-made inexpensive Chevy mini-car gets revamped with a more powerful 1.4-litre four-cylinder engine with 98 horsepower, 14 more than the current model. It also looks less bug-eyed and more modern, with a lower roof line, jeweled headlamps and a rounded front end. Choice of a continuously variable transmission or five-speed manual. Has 10 air bags for safety. Price hasn't been announced. Due in showrooms in the fall. 

VOLT: Chevy's gas-electric hybrid gets sleeker looks and increased battery range in a redesign for 2016. The new Volt can go 53 miles on battery power before a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder engine kicks in to generate electricity and keep the car going. The current version goes only 38 miles on electricity. The new gas-powered generator also is more efficient than the current model. When it's on, the Volt gets 42 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving, 5 mpg better than the current car. The more aerodynamic look of the new Volt comes with a price, though. Rear-seat headroom is shallow, as is legroom. The new Volt is due out in the fall, priced at $33,170 excluding shipping and a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric cars. 

___ 

DODGE 

VIPER ACR: It stands for American Club Racer, and it's the fastest street-legal Viper ever, according to the company. The ACR is designed to squeeze faster track lap times out of the venerable Dodge super car with a race-tuned suspension. It has high-performance Kumho racing tires and is powered by the Viper's hand-built 8.4-litre V-10 with 645 horsepower. Already on sale. Starts at $117,895, excluding shipping and a gas-guzzler tax. 

___ 

FERRARI 

488 GTB, 488 SPIDER: New V8-powered sports cars that replace the 458 Italia and Spider. Each are powered by a 3.9-litre turbocharged motor that puts out 641 horsepower and takes the cars from zero to 62 miles per hour in a screaming 3 seconds. GTB is more aerodynamic than their predecessors with a double front spoiler and a new rear spoiler. The Spider has a retractable hard top. GTB available later this fall for about $245,000. Spider hits showrooms next year at about $275,000. 

___ 

FIAT 

500X: Fiat gets a much-needed small crossover SUV to take advantage of the worldwide SUV craze. The bulked-up 500 keeps the brand's cute European styling but can seat five comfortably. Choice of two engines, a 1.4-litre, 160-horsepower turbo four mated to a six-speed manual transmission and a 2.4-litre, 180 horsepower four with a nine-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive version has a rear axle that disconnects when it's not needed, for better fuel economy. Already on sale. Starts at $20,000 excluding shipping. 

___ 

FORD 

GT: After a decade's absence, Ford's GT returns at the end of 2016. The chiseled supercar looks more like a Ferrari than a Ford. It will get more than 600 horsepower with its mid-mounted, twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, which is mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission. It's Ford's most expensive vehicle ever, with a price tag around $400,000. The company plans to make just 250 GTs per year for the next several years. 

SHELBY GT350\/GT350R: The GT350 is a performance version of the new Mustang, which went on sale last fall. It boasts a howling, 5.2-litre V8 engine with 526 horsepower. The aluminum hood is lower and more sloped than on the regular Mustang, for better aerodynamics. The inside is spare; chrome and bright finishes were removed to prevent sun glare from distracting the driver. If the GT350 isn't enough, enthusiasts can check out the GT350R, a pure racing car that's 130 pounds lighter than the GT350 thanks to the removal of anything extra, including air conditioning, rear seats and even carpet. There are carbon fiber wheels and a big rear spoiler for even faster cornering. Production will be limited. The GT350 starts at $49,995, which includes $1,300 for a gas-guzzler tax, which applies to cars with combined fuel economy under 22.5 mpg. The GT350R starts at $63,495. 

___ 

HONDA 

CIVIC: The current Civic compact car strayed from its roots with bland styling, a cheap interior and lacklustre performance. An emergency refresh after a year on the market improved it, but still didn't offer much excitement. That should change with the 2016, or 10th generation, model. Honda claims it will be the sportiest Civic ever, and judging from the fastback look of the coupe, the company may be right. The new Civic gets two new engines: a normally aspirated direct-injected four-cylinder with an undisclosed size, and a 1.5-litre, direct-injection turbo four-cylinder. Specifications haven't been released. They're mated to a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic. Sedan debuts later this fall, while the coupe comes in the winter. Prices haven't been released yet. 

PILOT: Honda's biggest SUV gets re-engineered for 2016, shedding its worn-out boxy look for a more sculpted body that mimics its smaller cousin, the CR-V. It comes with an all-new 3.5-litre, direct-injected V6 with 280 horsepower, 30 more than the old version. It also gets two new automatic transmissions, either a six-speed or an optional nine-speed. The new power plant and transmission help the Pilot get up to 27 miles per gallon on the highway, two more than the 2015 model. For those who want luxury, the Pilot also gets a new Elite grade with a panoramic roof and second-row captain's chairs. Went on sale in June. Starts at $29,995 without shipping. 

___ 

HYUNDAI 

SONATA HYBRID: The gas-electric version of the Korean automaker's midsize car is new this year. The latest version gets a more powerful electric motor, a bigger battery pack and a revised transmission to boost fuel economy by about 10 per cent. Car is powered mainly by a 2-litre direct-injected four-cylinder gas engine, with a more powerful 38-kilowatt electric motor. Combined they put out 193 horsepower. Hybrid is expected to get 39 miles per gallon in the city and 44 mpg on the highway. Front and rear fascias and new wheels help it look different than standard Sonatas. Already on sale. Starts at $26,000 excluding shipping. 

TUCSON: Hyundai's entry in the fast-growing small SUV market gets longer, wider, sleeker and more efficient. The automaker added 3 inches to the Tucson's length and made the SUV just over an inch wider. That increased passenger room and added more than 5 cubic feet to the cargo area. Suspension was bolstered to improve handling without hurting ride quality, Hyundai says. The old version's 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine is gone. Base model has a 2-litre, 164 horsepower four, while upper-level models get a 1.6-litre turbocharged four with 175 horsepower. The turbo engine gets a seven-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission. An Eco version is expected to get 33 mpg on the highway, while Sport and Limited front-wheel-drive versions get an estimated 30 mpg highway. That's 3 mpg better than the outgoing model. Already on sale. Starts at $22,700 excluding shipping. 

___ 

JAGUAR 

XF: All-new big luxury sedan goes on sale in October with a lightweight aluminum-intensive frame, a coupe-like look and more space inside. The second-generation car comes with a 3-litre supercharged V6, and buyers can chose between 340 and 380 horsepower versions in either rear or all-wheel-drive. The all-wheel-drive model is 265 pounds lighter than the previous version. All engines are mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions. Price hasn't been announced. 

___ 

KIA 

OPTIMA: Kia's bestseller in the U.S., the Optima midsize car, gets its first full redesign since 2011. It's longer, wider and stiffer, and has a bigger interior. There are three engine choices, including a new 1.6-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 178 horsepower. Two other engines — a 2.4-litre four-cylinder with 185 horsepower and a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 247 horsepower — are carried over from the previous Optima. Inside, Kia will soon offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow drivers to access certain apps from their smartphones on the car's 8-inch touchscreen. The 2016 Optima goes on sale at the end of this year. Pricing and fuel economy haven't been announced, but the 2015 Optima started at $21,690 and got up to 27 mpg in combined city\/highway driving. 

SORENTO: The Sorento crossover, last redesigned in 2010, gets a thicker, brawnier look for 2016. It's longer and slightly wider and has a more aggressive grille with narrowed headlights. The Sorento comes in five- or seven-passenger configurations; the five-passenger gets either a 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine with 185 horsepower or a new 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder with 240 horsepower, while the seven-passenger gets a 290-horsepower V6. Inside, there's more headroom, legroom and cargo room than before. Kia is offering new safety technology, including a forward collision warnings system and blind-spot detection. The Sorento gets up to 24 mpg in combined city\/highway driving with the base engine, and up to 21 mpg with the V6. The Sorento, which went on sale in January, starts at $24,900. 

___ 

LAMBORGHINI 

AVENTADOR 750-4 SUPERVELOCE: If you have a spare $500,000, the new performance version of the Aventador — dubbed the Superveloce — might be for you. The track-ready race car has a 740-horsepower V12 engine — up from 700 in the Aventador — and is 110 pounds lighter thanks to more use of carbon fiber. It's the fastest series-production Lamborghini ever, with a blisteringly fast 0-62 mph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 217 mph. It gets 14.7 mpg in combined city\/highway driving if anyone cares. The Superveloce went on sale this summer, starting at $492,595. That includes a $3,700 gas-guzzler tax and a $3,495 shipping charge. A convertible version — the SV Roadster — goes on sale next spring for $530,075. 

___ 

LEXUS 

RX: Lexus' bestselling RX SUV gets its first major redesign since 2010. It has a polarizing design with a lot of sharp angles, including L-shaped LED front lights and a big spindle grille. The roof appears to float above the windows thanks to blacked-out pillars. Inside, there's more rear leg room and an available 12.3-inch dashboard monitor with a full-screen map. The RX is powered by an upgraded 3.5-litre V6 with 300 horsepower and a new eight-speed transmission. A hybrid version of the RX will also be available. Fuel economy and pricing will be released when the RX goes on sale later this year. 

GS 200t, GS F: The Lexus GS family of midsize cars gets two new members: the 200t and the GS F. The 200t is a rear-wheel-drive sedan with a turbocharged, 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine rated at 241 horsepower; for comparison, the GS 350 gets 311 horsepower with its 3.5-litre V6, and the hybrid GS 450h gets 338 horsepower with its V6 and electric motor combination. Lexus says the 200t will get up to 33 mpg in highway driving, nearly beating the hybrid. The high-performance GS F has a 5.0-litre v8 with 467 horsepower. It also sits lower and wider than the other GS models, with big air vents and carbon fiber accents. All four versions of the GS get Lexus' signature spindle grille for 2016, along with new, standard LED headlights. New safety features include pre-collision warning with pedestrian detection. The new GS lineup goes on sale later this year. Pricing hasn't been announced, but the outgoing GS 350 started at $48,600. 

LX 570: Lexus says it changed everything but the door panels on the eight-passenger LX 570 SUV. The front gets Lexus' signature spindle grille and new LED headlights. The 383-horsepower, 5.7-litre V8 engine is paired with a new eight-speed transmission to improve performance and efficiency. There's also a new driving mode selection system, which adjusts the powertrain and suspension depending on the driver's choice of eco, comfort or sport modes. New safety features include dynamic radar cruise control, which works at high and low speeds. Fuel economy and pricing haven't yet been released. 

___ 

LAND ROVER 

RANGE ROVER: A new, 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel V6 engine is being offered for the first time in North America on the 2016 Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. It has 254 horsepower, which is less than the 340-horsepower supercharged V6 on the gasoline model, but it gets 25 mpg in city\/highway driving, which is 32 per cent better than the gas option. Other new options include a hands-free tailgate, which opens when the driver swipes a foot underneath. A diesel-powered Range Rover Sport starts at $66,450; a diesel Range Rover starts at $86,450. 

RANGE ROVER SVAutobiography: The SVAutobiography replaces the Autobiography Black at the top of the Range Rover lineup. It's the most powerful production Range Rover in the model's 45-year history, with a 550-horsepower, 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine. The engine is shared with the Range Rover Sport SVR, but specially tuned for the SVAutobiography. New options include two-tone paint, with black on top and a choice of nine colours for the bottom, and a unique front grille. The SVAutobiography gets 15 mpg in city\/highway driving. It goes on sale this fall starting at $199,495. 

___ 

LINCOLN 

MKX: Lincoln's mid-size crossover has a sleeker, less bulbous design and an updated grille to match other new Lincolns. Under the hood, there's a base 3.7-litre V6 engine with 303 horsepower or a new 335-horsepower, 2.7-litre EcoBoost V6. Both are mated to a six-speed, push-button transmission. The base engine gets up to 20 mpg in combined city\/highway driving, while the EcoBoost gets 21. The MKX is the first Ford or Lincoln to offer pre-collision alert with pedestrian detection, which warns the driver of an impending collision and applies the brakes automatically. Other new features include auto hold, which holds the brake automatically in traffic and releases it when the accelerator is pressed, and a hands-free lift gate that opens when the driver kicks a foot beneath it. The new MKX went on sale this summer starting at $38,100. 

___ 

MAZDA 

CX-3: Mazda is entering the fast-growing subcompact SUV segment with the CX-3, joining competitors like the Honda HR-V. At 168.3 inches long, it's a little more than 10 inches shorter than the CX-5 SUV, but it shares the same swooping, ""soul of motion"" design Mazda has adopted throughout its lineup. The standard engine is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder with 146 horsepower, paired to a six-speed transmission. It gets an estimated 31 mpg in combined city\/highway driving. Buyers can opt for front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Standard features include push-button start and a system that reads your incoming text messages aloud. High-end options include a lane-departure warning system and rain-sensing wipers. The CX-3, on sale this fall, starts at $19,960. 

MX-5 MIATA: Twenty-six years after the debut of the first Miata, Mazda is introducing the fourth generation of the popular soft-top convertible. The new MX-5 hints at Mazda's ""soul of motion"" design language, with its long hood, flowing sides and large wheels pushed out to the edges, even as it keeps the playful, classic look of the original. Thanks to more extensive use of high-strength steel, the new Miata weighs 150 pounds less than the previous model, improving fuel economy and driving dynamics. The 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine is rated at 155 horsepower. Paired with either the standard six-speed manual transmission or the optional six-speed automatic, it gets an estimated 30 mpg in combined city\/highway driving, a 25 per cent improvement over the most efficient previous model. The MX-5 starts at $24,915.

MERCEDES-BENZ 

C350 Plug-In Hybrid: The midsize C-Class family gets a plug-in electric hybrid, one of 10 hybrids the brand plans to launch by 2017. It will be sold only in zero-emission states, including California, New York and Oregon. The C350 has a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine and an 80-horsepower motor powered by a lithium-ion battery; combined, the engine and motor are capable of 275 horsepower. It can travel around 20 miles on electric power alone. Fuel economy and pricing will be released closer to the car's launch next spring. 

C450 AMG: Mercedes hopes to broaden the customer base for its exclusive AMG performance brand with the C450 AMG, a $50,800 midsize sedan. The C450 has an upgraded, 3.0-litre V6 with 362 horsepower as well as AMG's 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system. Other AMG-specific touches include a specially tuned suspension adapted from the C63 AMG (which costs $13,000 more), bigger brakes, a spoiler on the rear and red-stitched sport seats. Fuel economy hasn't been released. The C450 goes on sale this fall. 

GLC300: The second generation of Mercedes' midsize SUV gets a new name — GLC, to tie it more closely to Mercedes' C-class family — and an elegant new look. The GLC replaces the boxy GLK; it has the same elongated hood but a much more aerodynamic roofline. Under the hood is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine rated at 241 horsepower and a new nine-speed transmission. Fuel economy hasn't been announced, but the GLC is 176 pounds lighter than the outgoing model thanks to more extensive use of aluminum and high-strength steel. There is a full suite of safety features, including a system that detects an impending rear-end collision and alerts the traffic behind it by operating the hazard warning lights. The GLC goes on sale in November, starting at $38,950. 

GLE COUPE: The GLE Coupe is the newest member of the GLE-class (formerly M-Class) of midsize SUVs. It's a four-door, five-seater; it gets the ""coupe"" name for its sloped roof and sporty driving. There are two variants. The GLE450, designed to bring more buyers into Mercedes's AMG performance brand, has a 3.0-litre V6 producing 362 horsepower. It has a new, nine-speed transmission. Standard features include a system that lets drivers choose between five driving feels, including one for comfort, one for slippery conditions and two sport modes. The more exclusive GLE63 S has a hand-built, 5.5-litre V8 with 577 horsepower that accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. It's mated to AMG's seven-speed automatic transmission. The GLE63 S gets some sporty touches, including diffuser fins in the rear, red brake calipers and chrome-plated twin tailpipe trims. The GLE Coupe goes on sale in late summer; fuel economy for both models hasn't been announced. The GLE450 starts at $65,100, while the GLE63 S starts at $109,300. 

MERCEDES-AMG G65: Mercedes dials up the power in the third variant of its boxy G-Class SUV. It has a 621-horsepower, 6.0-litre V12 engine and a seven-speed transmission. Fuel economy hasn't been released, but it won't be good. The G65 goes on sale this fall, starting at $217,900. That makes it the fourth member of Mercedes' exclusive AMG performance family to be priced above $200,000. 

MERCEDES-MAYBACH S600: This is a stretched, hyper-luxury version of Mercedes' full-size S-Class sedan. It has a 523-horsepower, V12 engine mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission; it gets 20 mpg on the highway. There's an advanced suspension control system that scans the road ahead with a camera and prepares to absorb any bumps. Standard perks include heated arm rests and door panels, a fragrance system on the glove box that diffuses one of five aromas and a power footrest on the right rear seat. A heated and cooled rear cup-holder is $1,950 extra. The Mercedes-Maybach S600 went on sale in the spring; it starts at $189,350.

NISSAN 

MAXIMA: Nissan brings some life to the flagging full-size sedan segment with the new Maxima. It has a bold, chiseled surface, the ""V''-shaped grille found on other new Nissans like the Rogue SUV, and a roof that looks like it's floating above the car thanks to blacked-out pillars. Under the hood is an updated version of the 300-horsepower, 3.5-litre V6 engine from the outgoing Maxima. It's mated to a new continuously variable transmission. Those revisions helped increase the Maxima's highway fuel economy to 30 mpg; city fuel economy is 22 mpg. New safety options include a driver attention alert system, which warns drivers if changes in steering indicate they might not be paying attention. The Maxima went on sale in early June at a starting price of $32,410. 

TITAN: Nissan, a bit player in the full-size truck market dominated by Ford, Chevrolet and Ram, hopes to shake things up with the new Titan. Among its engine offerings will be a Cummins 5.0-litre V8 turbo diesel, the kind of engine normally found on more expensive heavy-duty trucks. The engine gives the truck maximum towing capacity of more than 12,000 pounds and maximum payload of 2,000 pounds — near the top of the segment — but with what Nissan says will be 20 per cent better fuel economy than a gas-powered V8. Gas-powered V6 and V8 engines will also be available. Nissan will release pricing and other details closer to the launch of the new Titan later this year.

TOYOTA 

LAND CRUISER: Toyota's eight-passenger SUV gets a significant refresh. There's a new hexagonal grille, narrower LED headlights and a bulging hood atop the 381-horsepower V8 engine. There's also a new eight-speed transmission to enhance fuel efficiency; the Land Cruiser gets 15 mpg in city\/highway driving. New safety features include blind-spot detection and a front collision warning system. Everything is standard; the only thing buyers choose is the colour. Pricing will be released this fall, but the previous model started at $80,155. 

MIRAI: In Japanese, ""mirai"" means future, a fitting name for one of the world's first mass-produced hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The Mirai has an electric battery powered by hydrogen, and it emits nothing but water vapour from its tailpipe. It can go 312 miles between fill-ups and gets the equivalent of 67 miles per gallon. Like the gas-electric hybrid Prius, which it resembles, the Mirai is meant to be instantly recognizable as something different. Its pointy hood sits above huge, triangular air intakes, and the sides are swept back and deeply grooved. It could be tough to get your hands on one, since only a few hundred will be made in the first year. Only California buyers are eligible, and they must take delivery from one of eight authorized dealers in the Los Angeles or San Francisco areas. They must also live close to a hydrogen refuelling station. The Mirai starts at $57,500 plus an $835 destination fee; that price includes free fuel and maintenance for three years.

It's the first full redesign for the Tacoma in 12 years. The frame and body have more high-strength steel, to make them lighter but more rigid and better for off-road driving. Toyota also gave the Tacoma a new chiseled face and hexagonal grille, to better match its bigger sibling, the Tundra. The Tacoma has a 159-horsepower, 2.7-litre four-cylinder engine and an optional 3.5-litre V6 with 278 horsepower. Both are paired with a new six-speed transmission; six-speed and five-speed manuals are also available. The front-wheel-drive version gets up to 21 mpg in combined city\/highway driving; the four-wheel drive gets 21 mpg in combined city\/highway driving. Five versions will be offered, including a top-of-the-line Limited and an off-road TRD with multi-terrain select and a built-in mount for a GoPro camera near the rear-view mirror. The Tacoma, which will be built in Texas and Mexico, goes on sale this fall starting at $23,300.

VW to submit ""comprehensive"" plan to regulators over emissions scandal. (ShareCast News) - Volkswagen has a ""comprehensive"" plan of action to ensure its diesel models will be able to meet emission standards, Reuters reported.

The German car manufacturer acknowledged two weeks ago it had deliberately deceived officials about how much its diesel cars polluted.

In a speech to around 1,000 senior managers on late on Monday, VW's new chief executive Matthias Mueller outlined the plans which will be submitted to regulators.

The company is under huge pressure to tackle the crisis as Germany's motoring regulator Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt had set a deadline of 7 October for a plan to bring diesel emissions into line with the law.

Reuters reported he said the German car manufacturer will tell its customers ""in the next few days"" to retrofit affected diesel models and provide technical solutions to authorities in October.

""We are facing a long trudge and a lot of hard work,"" Mueller said in the speech text seen by Reuters. ""We will only be able to make progress in steps and there will be setbacks.""

Mueller also said VW's core autos division, which is struggling with high fixed costs and low profit margins, will become as independent as Audi and Porsche going forward.

""The new company structure is a first step and the basis for a modernization of VW, for a new and better company,"" he said.. Are you driving a VW diesel? Here's what you need to know. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - 

Are you one of the lucky owners of a Volkswagen diesel vehicle who just discovered your car cheats on emissions tests? 

You're in good company: There are about 500,000 of you out there.

Volkswagen was busted on Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency for cheating on emissions tests. VW diesels (and diesel-powered Audi A3s) have been emitting as much as 40 times the legal amount of dangerous pollutants. 

The car maker was ordered to recall the vehicles and bring them into compliance with emissions rules. 

But what do owners do in the meantime? 

For now, sit tight. Even the EPA said you should continue using your car as you always have. 

Volkswagen installed software that can automatically detect when cars are being tested for emissions. The engine then runs in a way that reduces emissions to legal levels. But when the cars aren't being tested, the engines go back to running ""normally"" and emit far more pollutants.

It's not clear how VW will address the problem. But it's possible that any change will make cars use more fuel and hurt their performance. 

""It's very likely it will adversely affect fuel economy and performance,"" said Jake Fisher, head of auto testing for Consumer Reports, one of the most influential magazines in America among auto shoppers.

That's a big deal, since performance and fuel economy are big, big reasons that buyers choose VW diesel vehicles to begin with. Small diesel-powered cars get fuel economy close to that of gasoline-powered hybrids. And, with engines that have plenty of pulling power, they're fun to drive, too. 

After Friday's news, Consumer Reports almost immediately stopped recommending the cars until it has a chance to test them after VW fixes the problem. The affected cars span model years 2009 through 2015.

It's unclear how VW will get owners to comply with the recall. Many car owners ignore recall notices even when there are serious safety issues involved. In this case, driver's lives aren't at risk so it could be all the more tempting to toss a recall notice in the recycling bin.

""It might put to test the government's will to forcefully recall cars,"" said Brian Moody, executive editor for AutoTrader.com.

But this recall might be tough to ignore. States could require proof that the problem has been fixed before allowing cars to be registered or renewed.

Your car's resale value could depend heavily on getting it into compliance.

For now, though, little is known how this will play out. Stay tuned.. VWs Dieselgate Now Spreads to Audi. Posted Monday, September 28th 2015 @ 9am  by Jenn Gidman,  Newser Staff

PHOTO. Audi : US says 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars intentionally violate clean air standards. WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency says nearly 500,000 Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars built in the past seven year are intentionally violating clean air standards by using software that evades EPA emissions standards. 
 
The EPA says the cars include a device programmed to detect when the car is undergoing official emissions testing. The cars only turn on full emissions control systems during that testing. The EPA says the controls are turned off during normal driving situations. 
 
The EPA called the company's use of the device illegal and a threat to public health. 
 
The EPA called on VW to fix the cars' emissions systems, but said car owners do not need to take any immediate action. 
 
VW said in a statement it is co-operating with the investigation. 

Â© 2015 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved., source Canadian Press DataFile. VW Could Face $18B In EPA Penalties Over Auto Software. Volkswagen AG faces penalties up to $18 billion after being accused of designing software for diesel cars that deceives regulators measuring toxic emissions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday. 
 
""Put simply, these cars contained software that turns off emissions controls when driving normally and turns them on when the car is undergoing an emissions test,"" Cynthia Giles, an enforcement officer at the EPA, told reporters in a teleconference. 
 
Volkswagen can face civil penalties of $37,500 for each vehicle not in compliance with federal clean air rules. There are 482,000 four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars sold since 2008 involved in the allegations. If each car involved is found to be in noncompliance, the penalty could be $18 billion, an EPA official confirmed on the teleconference. 
 
A U.S. Volkswagen spokesman said the company ""is cooperating with the investigation; we are unable to comment further at this time."" 
 
The feature in question, which the EPA called a ""defeat device,"" masks the true emissions only during testing and therefore when the cars are on the road they emit as much as 40 times the level of pollutants allowed under clean air rules meant to ensure public health is protected, Giles said. 
 
The EPA accused Volkswagen of using software in four-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars from model years 2009 to 2015 made to circumvent emissions testing of certain air pollutants. 
 
The cars are not facing recall at this time, the EPA said. VW did not indicate on Friday how it will address the issue. 
 
The EPA has the authority to order VW to recall the vehicles. However, that process could take up to a year, depending on the complexity of the issue, an EPA official said. 
 
The diesel-powered vehicles involved from the 2009 to 2015 model years are the VW Jetta, VW Beetle, VW Golf and the Audi A3, as well as the VW Passat from model years 2014 and 2015. 
 
VW in North America has heavily marketed its vehicles as being ""clean diesel."" 
 
In a television commercial that has aired frequently this year in the United States, VW says it is the ""No. 1 diesel car brand in America,"" brags its cars are ""clean diesel"" and asks viewers, ""Isn't it time for German engineering?"" 
 
Since 2009, diesel vehicles have made up approximately 15 percent of VW and Audi U.S. sales.

EPA says VW intentionally violates clean air standards. The Environmental Protection Agency says nearly 500,000 Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars built in the past seven year are intentionally violating clean air standards by using software that evades EPA emissions standards. . VW Manipulated Tests In Europe, Says Germany. Volkswagen manipulated emissions tests in Europe as well as the US, Germany's transport minister has said. 

Alexander Dobrindt said: ""We have been informed that also in Europe, vehicles with 1.6 and 2.0 litre diesel engines are affected by the manipulations that are being talked about."" 
 
He added it was unclear how many vehicles in Europe were affected and confirmed random tests would be carried out on cars made by other manufacturers. 
 
The VW controversy is centred on ""defeat devices"" it used to fool US emissions tests on diesel cars into believing the vehicles met environmental standards. 
 
The company admits the software, which switches engines to a cleaner mode during official testing, may have been fitted in 11 million vehicles worldwide. 
 
VW has not responded to Mr Dobrindt's claim. 
 
At least 482,000 cars are to be recalled and the carmaker could face penalties of more than $18bn (£11bn) in the US alone. 
 
 :: VW Emissions Scandal: Key Questions Answered 
 
Volkswagen will start firing people responsible for manipulating the tests on Friday, sources told the Reuters news agency. 
 
The carmaker's supervisory board will give initial findings from an internal investigation into who was responsible as well as revealing a successor to chief executive Martin Winterkorn, it reported. 
 
German newspaper Bild reported that two of Volkswagen group's most senior engineers will be forced to leave. 
 
Audi's research and development boss Ulrich Hackenberg and Porsche's engine chief Wolfgang Hatz will be dismissed, Bild reported, citing unnamed company sources. 
 
VW and Porsche declined to comment on the report, while Audi could not be reached for comment. 
 
The global impact of the scandal is not yet known, with UK drivers waiting to find out if their cars are affected. 
 
It has been warned the scandal could lead to Britain's biggest ever class action lawsuit. 
 
Bozena Michalowska-Howells of law firm Leigh Day said: ""If it is shown that this piece of software defeated the European testing then Volkswagen would be in a very similar position as it is in the US and may well then have to call in their cars with all the resulting costs involved. 
 
""This could well lead to one of the largest group claims ever in this country against Volkswagen for the way in which consumers may have been misled in relation to their vehicle."" 
 
 :: The End Of Europe's Love Affair With Diesel? 
 
Mr Winterkorn quit VW on Wednesday, saying he accepted responsibility for ""irregularities found in diesel engines"" but had not been aware of any wrongdoing. 
 
VW has set aside an initial £4.7bn to cover the fallout and ""win back the trust"" of customers.

(c) Sky News 2. Two More VW Executives Said to be Departing Amid Emissions Scandal -- Update. By Hendrik Varnholt  
FRANKFURT--Two top lieutenants of former Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn are being replaced, according to people familiar with the situation--the latest fallout from the company's admission that software embedded in its engines duped U.S. diesel-emissions testing. 
 
Ulrich Hackenberg, chief technology officer of VW's Audi unit, and Wolfgang Hatz, board member for research and development at VW's Porsche AG, are to be replaced, two people familiar with the situation said Thursday. 
 
VW's entire supervisory board, a group of executives including major shareholders who preside over management in a similar way as a U.S. board of directors, is slated to meet Friday. Mr. Winterkorn resigned Wednesday. 
 
Members of the supervisory board's executive committee said after their meeting Wednesday and after Mr. Winterkorn's resignation, further personnel decisions will be taken at Friday's meeting. 
 
Mr. Winterkorn's resignation Wednesday follows a calamitous week after a disclosure last Friday by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that Volkswagen allegedly used software on some of its Volkswagen and Audi diesel-powered cars that make them appear to run cleaner in tests than they do on the road. 
 
On Tuesday, Volkswagen disclosed that as many as 11 million cars were affected and possibly subject to a global recall. The company issued a profit warning and announced it was taking a EUR6.5 billion ($7.27 billion) provision against earnings to cover the costs of fixing the software.

  BERLIN - German prosecutors are investigating former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn for possible fraud related to selling cars with falsified emissions data even as the world's biggest automaker suspended three top engineers. 
Prosecutors in the German state of Lower Saxony said they have launched a criminal investigation into Winterkorn. 
 
The company, which overtook Toyota in the first half of the year as the biggest car maker by sales, is in crisis over its rigging of diesel engine emissions tests in America and Europe. 
 
The company says 11 million of its cars around the world could be affected 
 
The company also suspended three top engineers, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as VW tries to get to grips with a crisis that has knocked more than a third off its market value and could harm Germany's economy. 
 
Winterkorn resigned last week owning responsibility for the scandal, but he has said he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. 
 
The probe into Winterkorn will look at ""allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data"", the prosecutor's office said. 
 
On Friday, the company appointed Matthias Mueller, the head of Porsche, to succeed Winterkorn. 
 
Volkswagen's luxury brand, Audi, said on Monday that 2.1 million of its cars globally have been affected by the emissions scandal. 
 
Around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe were fitted with the software that allowed Volkswagen to cheat US emissions tests, while 13,000 Audi cars in the US and 577,000 in Germany were also impacted, Audi said. The affected lines include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5, the spokesman said. 
 
Also on Monday, VW's Czech division, Skoda, announced that 1.2 million of its cars were affected by the diesel engine manipulations. 
 
German media meanwhile reported that a Volkswagen engineer had warned the firm about cheating over emission testing back in 2011. 
 
VW, whose subsidiaries also include Porsche and koda, said last week that about 11 million of its cars worldwide were affected by the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
The announcement follows reports on Monday that VW has suspended the research and development chiefs at its VW, Audi and Porsche units. 
 
VW's supervisory board agreed on Friday to put several employees on leave until the details of the emissions scandal were cleared up. No names were provided. 
 
Audi, VW and Porsche declined to comment. VW shares were down more than 5 percent at euro 101.7 (74.8p) in Frankfurt on Monday. 
 
The scandal has become an embarrassment for Germany, which has for years held up Volkswagen as a model of its engineering prowess and has lobbied against some tighter regulations on automakers. 
 
The German car industry employs more than 750,000 people and is a major source of export income. 
 
""The car industry is crucial for the German economy. It (the 
 
scandal) can have a big impact on the German economy,"" Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn told a conference.

SEOUL\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The scandal engulfing Volkswagen AG , which has admitted cheating diesel vehicle emissions tests in the United States, spread east on Tuesday as South Korea said it would investigate three of the maker's diesel models. 

Volkswagen shares plunged by 19 percent on Monday after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on 

Friday that the world's biggest carmaker by sales used software that deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions and could face penalties of up to $18 billion (£12 billion). 

Media reports say the U.S. Department of Justice has started a criminal probe into the allegations, which cover several VW and Audi-branded diesel models including the Audi A3, VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat. 

The South Korean probe will involve 4,000 to 5,000 Jetta, Golf and Audi A3 vehicles produced in 2014 and 2015, Park Pan-kyu, a deputy director at South Korea's environment ministry, told Reuters. 

The ministry will consider recalling those vehicles after conducting the investigation, he said. 

""If South Korean authorities find problems in the VW diesel cars, the probe could be expanded to all German diesel cars,"" he said. 

Volkswagen Korea declined to comment. 

German rivals Daimler and BMW have said the accusations against VW did not apply to them. 

The European Commission has said it is in contact with VW and U.S. regulators, but it was too early to say whether VW vehicles in Europe were also affected. 

A VW spokesman in Australia said the company had contacted its head office in Germany asking for advice about how to proceed and whether it expected cars sold in Australia to be affected. He added that the Australian office had not been contacted by local police or government agencies. 

""SCREWED UP"" 

Overnight, VW's U.S. head Michael Horn, who was attending a lavish event in New York to promote the 2016 VW Passat, admitted the company had ""totally screwed up"" and vowed to make amends. 

Horn's presentation did not promote the environmental efficiency of the Passat's ""clean diesel"" model, focussing instead on the vehicle's new sensor technology to assist with parking and avoiding accidents. 

It is unclear what will be the ultimate cost of the scandal to VW, which also faces a class-action lawsuit from buyers, but sales of affected versions of the relevant models have already been suspended in the United States and Canada. 

""I had to back out of a couple deals the same day,"" said a dealer attending Horn's event in New York. ""That hurt me because we found out in real-time. What are you going to do?"" 

German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has expressed concern that the scandal could damage ""the justifiably excellent reputation of the German car industry"", and South Korea, where two thirds of all car imports in the first half were diesel, could be a significant early gauge of customer response. 

German car sales in South Korea have soared since a 2011 free-trade deal eliminated duties on vehicles imported from Europe. Vehicle imports from Germany rose 18.2 percent to $4.5 billion in the first eight months of 2015, South Korean customs data show, following a 42.5 percent increase for all of 2014. 

Volkswagen and Audi accounted for 28.2 percent of all foreign cars sold the in the first eight months, according to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association. 

Suh Sung-moon, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, said local brands such as Hyundai and its sister firm Kia Motors  would benefit. 

""South Korean consumers are very sensitive to news, and this emission news will have an impact on the import market,"" he said.

KUALA LUMPUR: Audi Malaysia yesterday announced the immediate availability of the exclusive Audi A3 Carbon Edition in Malaysia. Based on the award-winning Audi A3 1.4 TFSI, this single-batch Audi A3 Carbon Edition is limited to a run of just 30 units fully kitted in specially selected Audi Genuine Accessories for an even more stylishly sporty sedan. 
 
Immo Buschmann, Managing Director of Audi Malaysia shares, “The Audi A3 Carbon Edition is a showcase of how discerning customers can select customised packages featuring our range of Audi Genuine Accessories to achieve a look that is both individualistic but still distinctively Audi for their vehicles. As we ramp up our presence in Malaysia, I am looking forward to introducing more products that broaden the range of our offerings for customers that want something a little more exclusive.” 
 
Each Audi A3 Carbon Edition features a combination of interior and exterior accoutrements that accentuate the car’s sporting character and innate style credentials. Available only in Glacier White, the exterior features the Audi exclusive black styling package and the addition of a glossy black front spoiler, with matching rear apron and side sills for a contrastingly understated look all throughout. 
 
To ramp up the visual flair, the 17” cast aluminium rims on a standard Audi A3 1.4 TFSI have been replaced with sporty 18” matt black 5-arm rotor design rims along with carbon exterior mirror housings and a carbon tailgate spoiler that reinforce its sporting intentions. 
 
On the inside, the Audi A3 Carbon Edition also sees the inclusion of Alcantara and leather combination sport seats, front + rear parking aid and comfort key as standard, providing a combination of premium finishing, convenience and technology all in one. To cap it all off, each of these striking sedans will also feature an individually numbered stainless steel plaque on the centre console, underlining its coveted status and innate rarity. 
 
The limited edition Audi A3 Carbon Edition comes from a solid pedigree, with the Audi A3 having won the World Car of the Year 2014, the same year it was introduced into Malaysia. With a long wheelbase, and short overhangs for a total length of 4,460 millimetres (14.63 ft), the A3’s body features an intelligent multi-material construction making it ultra-lightweight at just 1,310 kg, giving it the capacity for dynamic performance and class-leading space in an attractive package. 
 
Under the hood, the 1.4 TFSI engine is mated with a lightning fast 7-speed S tronic transmission that develops a total of 125 hp and 200 Nm of torque between 1,400 to 4,000 rpm. Despite its modest engine capacity, this compact sedan is able to accelerate from 0 - 100km\/h in 9.3 seconds en route to a top speed of 212km\/h. Of course, fuel efficiency is something that comes standard in an Audi, so the A3 1.4 TFSI has a fuel consumption of just 4.9 litres\/100km and a combined CO2 rating emission of just 114g\/km. 
 
Each A3 Carbon Edition comes equipped with a smorgasbord of electronic features to ensure an efficient and safe driving experience, including a start\/stop system with energy recuperation, Electronic Stabilisation Control (ESC) consisting of Traction Control (ASR), Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD), Electronic Differential Lock (EDL), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and a 7 airbag system. Last, but certainly not least, the Audi A3 Carbon Edition comes equipped with an MMI® radio with MMI® control panel features a 5.8” colour display along with a 10 loudspeaker Audi sound system. 
 
The exclusive Audi A3 Carbon Edition is now available for a limited time only at all authorised Audi showrooms nationwide, retailing at only RM194, 333. For more information, visit www.audi.com.my .. Consumer Reports Suspends “Recommended” Status For Recalled VW Vehicles. Earlier today, the Environmental Protection Agency took the unusual action of issuing a motor vehicle recall for nearly 500,000 Volkswagen and Audi sedans that used software to circumvent emissions tests. In light of this development, our colleagues at Consumer Reports have suspended their rating for two of the cars involved in the recall. CR had previously given a “Recommended” rating to the diesel versions of both the VW Jetta and Passat. “These recommendations will be suspended until Consumer Reports can re-test these vehicles with a recall repair performed,” reads at a statement from the publication. “Once the emissions systems are functioning properly, we will assess whether the repair has adversely affected performance or fuel economy.” In addition to the Passat and Jetta, recalls for issued for the diesel editions of the VW Beetle and the Audi 3. The EPA determined, following an independent analysis by researchers at West Virginia University, that the automaker intentionally installed “defeat device” software in 482,000 diesel 4-cylinder vehicles between model years 2009 and 2015 as a way to evade emissions standards for certain pollutants. According to agency, the “sophisticated software algorithm” in the vehicles is programmed to detect when the car is undergoing official emissions testing. When it determines that a test is being performed, the vehicle’s full emissions control system will be deployed. But the EPA says that when a test is not being performed, these cars “emit nitrogen oxides, or NOx, at up to 40 times the standard.” “Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,” Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, said in a statement. by Chris Morran via Consumerist.

When buyers from Sam Swope Auto Group's used-car Buy Center come across vehicles parked in public places with for-sale signs displayed, they whip out their smartphones, scan the VIN, run a vehicle history report and leave a card with a written cash offer on the windshield.Arlena Sawyers Automotive News
September 28, 2015 - 12:01 am ET Sam Swope Auto Group of Louisville, Ky., aims to buy virtually every private-party used car and truck it can find for sale in its market. Buyers stationed at its used-vehicle Buy Center appraise and make cash offers for vehicles from walk-in sellers and those brought in by appointments made on its website, selltosamswope.com. The buyers also comb Craigslist and other online listings in search of for-sale-by-owner vehicles. They make house calls to sellers' homes or offices in SUVs wrapped with graphics touting: ""Sell to Sam Swope.com"" and ""We pay cash for your car.""
And when Buy Center staffers happen upon for-sale vehicles parked in public places? They whip out their smartphones, scan the vehicle identification number, run a vehicle history report and leave a written cash offer -- subject to a mechanical inspection -- on the windshield. Cary Donovan, Sam Swope Auto vice president of operations, declined to say how many vehicles the group buys from private sellers. But he noted purchases have grown 25 to 30 percent over the last two and a half years. To be sure, half of the vehicles are wholesaled because they don't meet the company's retail standards. But that's just fine, Donovan said. The laser-focused effort to become the go-to destination for consumers who want to sell their vehicles supplements the group's used-car acquisition strategy and has evolved into a tidy profit center, he said.
'On steroids'
""We're a little different,"" said Donovan. ""We actually go to people's homes and offices if they don't want to come to us, or if they have a car that's not running. We've got this whole program on steroids."" The Buy Center's written cash offers are redeemable for a check or a voucher that can be applied to a vehicle purchase at any of Sam Swope Auto's 14 dealerships. Swope Automotive Group, of which Sam Swope Auto is part, retailed 10,853 new and 14,308 used vehicles at 30 dealerships in 2014, placing it at No. 89 on the Automotive News list of the top 150 dealership groups based in the U.S.
The annual list ranks groups based on new-vehicle sales. But used-vehicle data reveal Swope Automotive is one of 13 groups on the list whose used-vehicle sales outpaced new-vehicle sales last year. Swope Automotive's used-vehicle wholesale sales rose 4.9 percent in 2014 to 6,419 units in part because of Sam Swope Auto's uptick in private-party vehicle purchases. Burnell King, the Buy Center's purchasing manager, said the Sam Swope group started buying vehicles independent of its new- and used-vehicle sales more than a decade ago and used TV commercials for marketing. But last year, it embraced digital marketing in earnest, interacting with consumers on Craigslist and Facebook, which is less expensive and just as effective, though the effort still is backed by some TV commercials, King said. Also last year, Sam Swope Auto began making purchase offers via text messages. It learned that as long as a consumer is advertising a vehicle for sale, the group legally can text him or her. Donovan said Sam Swope Auto has no preference for a specific age, mileage or vehicle segment. The goal ""first and foremost"" is to buy cars and trucks that the dealership group can retail.
Anything
""We'll buy anything,"" said Donovan. ""If you've been using it for a flowerpot in the backyard, we'll pay you a minimum of $200."" Although a few of the vehicles sell at auction for less than what the dealership group paid, Donovan said that collectively, the prices at auction exceed the prices paid, so the effort yields a solid return for the group. ""We play the averages,"" he said. ""If you get ten $200 cars, you'll get a few winners out of the bunch, and some will flat surprise you. Somebody will see value in that vehicle and pay premium money to get it.""You can reach Arlena Sawyers at asawyers@crain.com.Tags: DealersRetailBest PracticesDealershipsadvertising  Print Reprints RespondHave an opinion about this story?

Former VW boss faces probe over emissions scandal. Auckland News.Net  Monday 28th September, 2015  
  BERLIN - German prosecutors are investigating former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn for possible fraud related to selling cars with falsified emissions data even as the world's biggest automaker suspended three top engineers. 
Prosecutors in the German state of Lower Saxony said they have launched a criminal investigation into Winterkorn. 
 
The company, which overtook Toyota in the first half of the year as the biggest car maker by sales, is in crisis over its rigging of diesel engine emissions tests in America and Europe. 
 
The company says 11 million of its cars around the world could be affected 
 
The company also suspended three top engineers, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as VW tries to get to grips with a crisis that has knocked more than a third off its market value and could harm Germany's economy. 
 
Winterkorn resigned last week owning responsibility for the scandal, but he has said he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. 
 
The probe into Winterkorn will look at ""allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data"", the prosecutor's office said. 
 
On Friday, the company appointed Matthias Mueller, the head of Porsche, to succeed Winterkorn. 
 
Volkswagen's luxury brand, Audi, said on Monday that 2.1 million of its cars globally have been affected by the emissions scandal. 
 
Around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe were fitted with the software that allowed Volkswagen to cheat US emissions tests, while 13,000 Audi cars in the US and 577,000 in Germany were also impacted, Audi said. The affected lines include the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5, the spokesman said. 
 
Also on Monday, VW's Czech division, Skoda, announced that 1.2 million of its cars were affected by the diesel engine manipulations. 
 
German media meanwhile reported that a Volkswagen engineer had warned the firm about cheating over emission testing back in 2011. 
 
VW, whose subsidiaries also include Porsche and koda, said last week that about 11 million of its cars worldwide were affected by the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
The announcement follows reports on Monday that VW has suspended the research and development chiefs at its VW, Audi and Porsche units. 
 
VW's supervisory board agreed on Friday to put several employees on leave until the details of the emissions scandal were cleared up. No names were provided. 
 
Audi, VW and Porsche declined to comment. VW shares were down more than 5 percent at euro 101.7 (74.8p) in Frankfurt on Monday. 
 
The scandal has become an embarrassment for Germany, which has for years held up Volkswagen as a model of its engineering prowess and has lobbied against some tighter regulations on automakers. 
 
The German car industry employs more than 750,000 people and is a major source of export income. 
 
""The car industry is crucial for the German economy. It (the 
 
scandal) can have a big impact on the German economy,"" Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn told a conference. 
 
Reuters quoted sources close to the probe who said the company had suspended Heinz-Jakob Neusser, head of brand development at its core VW brand.. VW Manipulated Tests In Europe, Says Germany. Volkswagen manipulated emissions tests in Europe as well as the US, Germany's transport minister has said. 

Alexander Dobrindt said: ""We have been informed that also in Europe, vehicles with 1.6 and 2.0 litre diesel engines are affected by the manipulations that are being talked about."" 
 
He added it was unclear how many vehicles in Europe were affected and confirmed random tests would be carried out on cars made by other manufacturers. 
 
The VW controversy is centred on ""defeat devices"" it used to fool US emissions tests on diesel cars into believing the vehicles met environmental standards. 
 
The company admits the software, which switches engines to a cleaner mode during official testing, may have been fitted in 11 million vehicles worldwide. 
 
VW has not responded to Mr Dobrindt's claim. 
 
At least 482,000 cars are to be recalled and the carmaker could face penalties of more than $18bn (£11bn) in the US alone. 
 
 :: VW Emissions Scandal: Key Questions Answered 
 
Volkswagen will start firing people responsible for manipulating the tests on Friday, sources told the Reuters news agency. 
 
The carmaker's supervisory board will give initial findings from an internal investigation into who was responsible as well as revealing a successor to chief executive Martin Winterkorn, it reported. 
 
German newspaper Bild reported that two of Volkswagen group's most senior engineers will be forced to leave. 
 
Audi's research and development boss Ulrich Hackenberg and Porsche's engine chief Wolfgang Hatz will be dismissed, Bild reported, citing unnamed company sources. 
 
VW and Porsche declined to comment on the report, while Audi could not be reached for comment. 
 
The global impact of the scandal is not yet known, with UK drivers waiting to find out if their cars are affected. 
 
It has been warned the scandal could lead to Britain's biggest ever class action lawsuit. 
 
Bozena Michalowska-Howells of law firm Leigh Day said: ""If it is shown that this piece of software defeated the European testing then Volkswagen would be in a very similar position as it is in the US and may well then have to call in their cars with all the resulting costs involved. 
 
""This could well lead to one of the largest group claims ever in this country against Volkswagen for the way in which consumers may have been misled in relation to their vehicle."" 
 
 :: The End Of Europe's Love Affair With Diesel? 
 
Mr Winterkorn quit VW on Wednesday, saying he accepted responsibility for ""irregularities found in diesel engines"" but had not been aware of any wrongdoing. 
 
VW has set aside an initial £4.7bn to cover the fallout and ""win back the trust"" of customers.

(c) Sky News 2. VW Scandal 'An Awful Lot Of Fuss', Says F1 Boss. Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has described the Volkswagen emissions scandal as ""an awful lot of fuss"". 

Speaking to Sky Sports News, Mr Ecclestone said it was ""strange"" that the company had been ""picked on"" for using illegal software to deceive emissions tests. 
 
""I think we're making an awful lot of fuss about this,"" he said. 
 
""When I think about this, and all the trucks that are charging around America - and buses, and generators all running on diesel - and there doesn't seem to be any control over that. 
 
""It's strange that they've sort of picked on somebody that's using a diesel engine in cars."" 
 
The German carmaker admitted last week that it used a special device to fool US emissions testing for its diesel vehicles. 
 
The device is able to detect when cars are undergoing tests, and can switch the vehicle to a low emission mode in order to achieve more favourable results. 
 
Some 11 million Volkswagen diesel cars built since 2008 are affected by the scandal. 
 
Audi, which is a subsidiary of Volkswagen, has also admitted that 2.1 million of its cars were fitted with emission cheating software . 
 
According to an Audi spokesman, around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe are fitted with the device, with 577,000 in Germany. 
 
Another 13,000 Audi cars in the US are affected. 
 
Vehicle lines involved include the Audi A1, A3, A4, A5, A6 and the TT, Q3 and Q5 models. 
 
Reports suggest the research and development chief of Audi, along with those of Volkswagen's core passenger car division and sports car maker Porsche, have been put on leave. 
 
All three companies have declined to comment. 
 
The CEO of the Volkswagen Group,  Martin Winterkorn, was forced to resign over the revelations after almost nine years in the job and was replaced by Matthias Müller, who has been the chief of another Volkswagen subsidiary, Porsche, since 2010. 
 
German investigators subsequently announced they have started an investigation into Winterkorn, which will focus on ""allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data"". 

(c) Sky News 2. Tech Disruption Hangs Over Automakers At Frankfurt Auto Show. A sense of impending disruption hangs over all the shiny new cars at this year's edition of the Frankfurt International Motor Show. 

The potential impact of automated driving and of extensively connected cars has pushed aside electric and low-emission vehicles as the major theme in just the two years since the show was last held. 

New technologies could lead to everything from real-time navigating around a slippery stretch of road, to eliminating the need for a home garage by having cars drive themselves to people who summon them through a mobile app. 

The big question among automakers is whether they will be the ones to provide new technologies — and profit from them — or will major tech companies like Google and Apple take a slice of the industry. For now, the two sides are balancing cooperation against competition as they gauge what the future holds. 

General Motors CEO Mary Barra succinctly expressed a common view, asserting that ""we will see more change in the industry in the next five to ten years than we have in the last 50."" 

Dieter Zetsche, the head of Daimler AG, described the car and technology companies as being ""frenemies."" 

He said Daimler would welcome competition, which he called ""the energy source for our economy."" What is important, he said, was for Daimler to keep control of customers' data, to not sell it to third parties, and to obey customer wishes on how it is used. That was his company's rationale for joining with Audi and BMW to buy Nokia's HERE mapping service: ""To be sure we define the fate of the data being gathered."" 

If Apple or Google start making cars — something neither has said they intend to do — ""then we are competitors."" 

Consultancy McKinsey found expectations of rapid change were widespread in the industry. In a survey of 91 industry executives for a report released Wednesday, it found 90 percent ""believe that their organization's business model will change or broaden because of connectivity and autonomous driving."" 

The company also found that more car customers would be willing to switch brands for better connected services. The number that would do so rose from 20 percent in 2014 to 37 percent this year. The company surveyed over 1,000 recent car customers each in Germany, the U.S. and China. ""The fact that within just one year the number of people willing to switch car brands for connectivity has almost doubled shows that connectivity is evolving from a should-have to a must-have"" for carmakers. 

More and more carmakers support the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay interfaces that let people use their smartphone apps, such as navigation or messaging, through their car's dashboard screen. Seven automakers had cars with Android Auto on display in Frankfurt: Audi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and its SEAT and Skoda brands, and Opel. General Motors has been connecting cars for years through its OnStar remove roadside assistance service, which it extended to its mass-market entrant in Europe. 

Google had no stand at the show, but has shaken up the auto industry by testing a self-driving car prototype. Traditional automakers such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, GM and Toyota are also working to gradually automate functions in the car until vehicles become fully capable of driving themselves, possibly by 2025. 

A key issue is when some automated functions become legal, and in what countries. Some of these technologies — especially for cars that drive themselves — are already appearing on new models, but are held back by legal and safety concerns. BMW's new 7-Series sedan can park itself with the driver standing outside at the press of a remote button. Cars can already warn drivers when they're leaving their lane, or deploy emergency brakes to avoid a rear-end collision. 

Daimler CEO Zetsche sketched out a transformative idea: ""You could for instance, think about a typical American neighborhood where you would avoid building 100 garages, getting more houses in, and having the cars being parked outside and come on demand,"" he said. ""That is a relatively simple task and could be accomplished certainly within the next five years. ... It depends on the restrictions."" 

According to Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn, autonomous driving might come in stages as more functions become automated and different jurisdictions allow them. He cautioned, however, that someone will always be behind the wheel able to take over. 

He also argued that tech companies would be an integral part of the car industry in the future. ""We cannot develop this technology on our own."" 

Google's engineering director in charge of Android Auto, Patrick Brady, attended the show for discussions with auto partners and said there was a convergence between the industries. 

""We are partnering in so many different ways but there are other places where we are competing, and I think that's healthy,"" he said. ""The consumer ultimately wins."". Porsche, Audi, VW brand chiefs front-runners for Volkswagen CEO job: sources. STUTTGART\/BERLIN\/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Porsche chief Matthias Mueller, Audi chief Rupert Stadler and the head of the VW brand, Herbert Diess, are seen as the front-runners to replace Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, three people familiar with the matter said.

Mueller is seen as the favorite among the three due to his years of experience within the group, two of the people said.

CEO Winterkorn resigned earlier on Wednesday, taking responsibility for the German carmaker's rigging of U.S. emissions tests. The supervisory board is to discuss the issue of succession on Friday.

(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach, Andreas Cremer, Jan Schwartz; Writing by Maria Sheahan). Is VW crisis an opportunity for investors?. Many UK investors are inclined not to put their money into overseas companies. It's hard enough picking through the bones of a British firm's annual statement and keeping track of corporate events, let alone a business based in another jurisdiction. 

However, every once in a while, something happens that changes all that. Step forward VW. Installing clever software to fool car emissions tests will cost it billions of euros and likely see a number of top brass, including CEO Martin Winterkorn, lose their jobs. 

This scandal is huge, and VW shares have plunged, but it's certainly caught the imagination of investors wherever they might be based. 

Trading above €250 in the spring, VW traded below €100 a share for the first time since 2011 on Wednesday as the Volkswagen board held a crisis meeting at the carmaker's giant plant in Wolfsburg. Before the scandal broke they were worth about €162. 
HIGH PRICE TO PAY 
Putting a precise figure on the likely cost to VW in terms of sales and profits is impossible given the situation remains highly fluid. 

The company, which also owns Audi, Seat, Skoda, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Porsche, has already said it will recognise a €6.5 billion (£4.76 billion) provision in its third-quarter results, but initial estimates by industry experts put the likely fine by industry regulators as high as $18 billion. 



Legal bills could be a further €5 billion. Put in context, last year the company made a pre-tax profit of €14.8 billion on record sales of €202 billion. 

But the final bill could be much more. Numbers so far have been based on the potential hit in North America where the emissions cheat on vehicles made between 2009 and 2015 was first discovered. It's a huge setback for VW, which had lost money in the US for years, but has been winning market share and was on track to hit bullish targets there. 

However, the main worry is European exposure, where VW makes a large chunk of its money. VW made over 10.2 million cars in 2014, of which 4.4 million were sold in Europe. 

It now admits that 11 million vehicles with Type EA 189 diesel engines which included the illegal software had been sold worldwide, and an EU-wide investigation is inevitable. But, of course, first 'confessions' are rarely the end of it. 
INVESTMENT CASE 
It cannot be stressed enough that a lack of clarity makes investing in VW, even at these multi-year lows, high risk. Many analysts have downgraded their recommendations and slashed earnings estimates. 

'We think legal and especially operational uncertainty will continue to weigh on the stock which makes pinpointing a 'fair level' a near impossible task and the unquantifiable risk might prohibit several investors to take a position,' writes Deutsche Bank. 

'We cut our earnings per share estimates materially over 2015-2017 accounting for a €5 billion legal fine, recall costs, lower growth and pricing pressure from brand damage (2 per cent). Any €1 billion additional fine would take away €2.02 per share.' 

Forecasts for operating profit in 2016 are cut by 35 per cent and by 28 per cent for 2017, and the broker downgrades its rating to 'hold' and halves its price target to €130. However, it does acknowledge there is a financial cushion, with net cash put at €12.5 billion in 2016 with a further €3 billion of proceeds is expected from the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Suzuki. 

JPMorgan makes big change, too. As well as cutting profit forecasts, it downgrades the shares to 'neutral' with a new December 2016 target price of €179 from €253 before 'as we lack clarity on the potential total cost of the recall and the risk of additional engine investigations'. 

But it adds: 'The longer-term equity story of VW remains intact and ready to revisit as soon as we gain clarity on the engine recall situation.' 

Over at UBS, the team made only a minor €10 trim to its price target yesterday, which now sits at a still mighty €290. 

'Despite near-term concerns we remain positive on VW as it is one of very few original equipment manufacturers whose earnings are meaningfully below potential and where we see significant levers to improve operating performance (ex-China) as well as portfolio and capital allocation. On our 2015E, VW is trading on 0.13 times sales, 2 times EBIT and 6 times earnings.' 

Clearly, there's a view that VW shares are undervalued. And it's true, the initial sell-off can often overshoot to the downside, as good news has a habit of heading too high, too fast. VW shares are currently trading at around €110 and, looking back in 12 months' time these levels may look like a bargain. 

However, with more questions than answers currently, it remains too early to tell if the rout is over. What is clear is that VW shares will remain volatile, which will be seen as an opportunity by some traders.. Are you driving a VW diesel? Here's what you need to know. Are you one of the lucky owners of a Volkswagen diesel vehicle who just discovered your car cheats on emissions tests? 
 
You're in good company: There are about 500,000 of you out there. 

Volkswagen was busted on Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency for cheating on emissions tests. VW diesels (and diesel-powered Audi A3s) have been emitting as much as 40 times the legal amount of dangerous pollutants. 

The car maker was ordered to recall the vehicles and bring them into compliance with emissions rules. 

But what do owners do in the meantime? 

For now, sit tight. Even the EPA said you should continue using your car as you always have. 

Volkswagen installed software that can automatically detect when cars are being tested for emissions. The engine then runs in a way that reduces emissions to legal levels. But when the cars aren't being tested, the engines go back to running ""normally"" and emit far more pollutants. 

It's not clear how VW will address the problem. But it's possible that any change will make cars use more fuel and hurt their performance. 

""It's very likely it will adversely affect fuel economy and performance,"" said Jake Fisher, head of auto testing for Consumer Reports, one of the most influential magazines in America among auto shoppers. 

That's a big deal, since performance and fuel economy are big, big reasons that buyers choose VW diesel vehicles to begin with. Small diesel-powered cars get fuel economy close to that of gasoline-powered hybrids. And, with engines that have plenty of pulling power, they're fun to drive, too. 

After Friday's news, Consumer Reports almost immediately stopped recommending the cars until it has a chance to test them after VW fixes the problem. The affected cars span model years 2009 through 2015. 

It's unclear how VW will get owners to comply with the recall. Many car owners ignore recall notices even when there are serious safety issues involved. In this case, driver's lives aren't at risk so it could be all the more tempting to toss a recall notice in the recycling bin. 

""It might put to test the government's will to forcefully recall cars,"" said Brian Moody, executive editor for AutoTrader.com. 

But this recall might be tough to ignore. States could require proof that the problem has been fixed before allowing cars to be registered or renewed. 

Your car's resale value could depend heavily on getting it into compliance. 

For now, though, little is known how this will play out. Stay tuned.. Audi says 2.1-million of its diesel cars are fitted with emissions cheat devices. Volkswagen’s top-of-range car maker says 2.1-million of its diesel vehicles worldwide are fitted with sophisticated software enabling them to cheat tests. The Latest: 2.1 million Audi vehicles have suspect software. 12:15 p.m. 

Volkswagen AG's upmarket Audi brand says 2.1 million of its vehicles are among those with the engines affected by the emissions-rigging scandal. 

Audi said Monday that the engine in question was built into 1.6-liter and 2-liter turbo diesel models in the A1, A3, A4, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 ranges, news agency dpa reported. The cars involved have engines in the ""euro 5"" emissions category; those with the newer ""euro 6"" engines aren't affected by the emissions scandal. 

Volkswagen said last week that 11 million vehicles worldwide contain software involved in the emissions-rigging scandal, and later added that 5 million of those were cars were produced by its core VW brand. The group hasn't yet given a full listing of what cars were involved. 

11:00 a.m. 

A European environmental organization says it has found some new models of Mercedes, Volkswagens, BMWs and other new cars consume much more gasoline than lab tests claim. 

The organization, Transport & Environment, said Monday it had found no proof the cars are equipped with the same sort of ""defeat devices"" installed on diesel-powered Volkswagens to enable them to cheat on emissions tests. 

But the group called on European Union governments to broaden their probes into the ""defeat devices"" to cover gasoline cars as well. 

Transport & Environment said according to its research, the gap between lab test results for fuel economy and real-world performance rose last year to 40 percent on average, from 8 percent in 2001. 

It said the difference for Mercedes A, C and E class models is over 50 percent.. Dauntless: The all-new Audi Q7. Luxurious comfort, the largest interior in the segment and a weight saving of up to 325 kilograms – the new edition of the Audi Q7 sets new standards. As the most advanced Q model ever made, the second generation Audi Q7 offers a new dimension in design, performance and technology. Its innovative assistance and infotainment systems along with revised engine performance make the large SUV an impressive package. Its new engines consume significantly less fuel than the previous model and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 50 g per kilometre. 

The Audi Q7 was first introduced to South Africa in 2006 and since then has sold in excess of 4,700 units locally. As of October 2015, the second generation of the successful C-segment SUV will be available at all Audi Dealerships in South Africa. 

Exterior design: 

The proportions of the new Audi Q7 are slimmer than its predecessor; the new model is 5.05 metres in length, 1.97 metres in width, 1.74 metres in height and has a wheelbase of 2.99 metres. These dimensions make the new generation 37 mm shorter and 15 mm slimmer, while the height has remained approximately the same. 

The Audi Q7 reveals many elements of the new Audi design idiom for Q models: it’s much more powerful and incisive, relies more on clearly accentuated lines and emphasises the horizontal through its more geometrical design. 

The Audi Singleframe grille is clearly three-dimensional in form; its horizontal toothed structure and its wide framing create an awareness of the status and presence of the vehicle. The side view continues the play of lines and surfaces. At the upper corner of the headlight the so-called “blister line” begins, which segments the side. Above the wheels it conveys an impression of restrained muscularity – a subtle homage to the classic quattro models from Audi. The wheel arches appear large and incisive; this highlighting of the wheels is also typically quattro. 

The rear of the Audi Q7 is characterised by three horizontal lines. They run in the area of the rear lights, number plate and the bumper. They structure the rear and emphasise the width therefore lending the vehicle a more sporty appearance. LED rear lights are standard on all Audi Q7 models. They continue the styling of the headlights, creating an especially progressive look. The underbody protection in the rear is an eye-catcher, it’s wide and includes a diffusor in aluminium look as well as rectangular tailpipes. The wrap-around tailgate gives the rear a wider appearance and facilitates loading and unloading. It offers electrical opening and closing as standard. 

Xenon headlights are offered as standard, however full LED headlights and Matrix LED headlights are also available as an option. Each Matrix LED headlight divides its high beam into 15 individual light-emitting diodes paired with three reflectors. A camera on the interior mirror analyses the traffic situation. Given this information, the control unit individually turns the diodes on and off, or dims in them in 64 stages each, depending on the situation. Together with the LED and Matrix LED headlights, Audi provides dynamic rear turn signals – their individual segments light up in rapid succession from the inside outwards. 

Interior design: 

The interior of the new Audi Q7 is extremely variable, user-friendly, comfortable and above all generously dimensioned. It offers the most spacious interior in the premium SUV segment. In terms of knee space, shoulder space and headroom (plus 41 millimetres in the front row), it even surpasses the dimensions of its predecessor – although the exterior of the overall car has become slightly more compact. 

The first row of seats displays progressiveness and quality through the sophisticated double inlays, Audi virtual cockpit and the new MMI operating system – while in the second and optional third row of seats, the whole versatility of this vehicle concept is revealed. If selected, the third row of seats are raised and lowered electrically for greater ease of use. Customers can also choose to personalise their interior with Audi exclusive during 2016. 

The new Audi Q7 comes with a large, highly variable luggage compartment. When all seven seats are occupied, it has a capacity of 295 litres. The five-seater offers 890 litres, and 2,075 litres with the second row seat backs folded down. Compared with the predecessor model, the loading sill is lower by nearly five centimetres. 

Engines, drivetrain and body: 

The new Audi Q7 will be launched in South Africa with one engine initially. The 3.0 TDI available now delivers 183 kW of power and 600 Nm of torque from 1500 to 3000 rpm. Acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h takes 6.3 seconds, with a top speed of 234 km\/h. On average, the 3.0 TDI consumes only 5.7 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres, emitting only 149 grams of CO2 per kilometre. 

A petrol engine in the form of a 2.0T FSI with an output of 185 kW and 370 Nm of torque will be available in South Africa in January. 

Newly developed from scratch, the drivetrain in the new Audi Q7 is much sleeker than its counterpart in the previous model, undercutting the old weight by 20 kilograms. A new quattro centre differential replaces the previous transfer case, and is integrated in the eight-speed tiptronic. 

The new eight-speed tiptronic is designed as a classic torque-converter transmission, shifting smoothly, quickly and spontaneously. Its high gear number allows frequent operation of the engine close to the ideal load point, while the high spread of 7.1:1 provides a long ratio at the uppermost gear for low rpms and low fuel consumption. On the other hand, the lower gears have a sporty, short ratio. 

Under normal driving conditions, the centre differential, designed as a planetary drive, distributes the power between the front and rear axles in a 40:60 ratio. Should the wheels of one axle lose their grip, it can transfer as much as 70 per cent of the power to the front and a maximum of 85 per cent to the rear without any delay. These lock-up values are higher than with the predecessor model, allowing a better defined distribution of torque and a high-precision, barely noticeable interplay with the control systems. 

An intelligent software feature, the wheel selective torque control supplements the quattro drive. If one of the driving wheels on the inside of a curve bears an insufficient load, the torque control’s management system initiates a minimum and precise brake intervention at that wheel. Self-steering behaviour remains neutral longer, and handling becomes more precise, agile and stable. 

Compared with the previous model, the ground clearance of the Q7 has been lowered by 50 millimetres, in part through lower installation of the engine. The suspension has also been redesigned from scratch. Relative to the previous model it is over 100 kilograms lighter – an important factor for agility. 

The standard-equipped driving dynamics system, Audi drive select, completes the versatile character of the new Audi Q7. Standard are the eight-speed tiptronic, electromechanical power steering, engine management, the automatic air conditioning and the engine sound. Added are options such as adaptive air suspension, the new all-wheel steering, the headlights and the adaptive cruise control. 

The adaptive air suspension can adjust the ride position of the body as required. At the offroad level, which is limited to a speed of 80 km\/h, the body lies 25 millimetres above the normal level, while at the lift level another 35 mm are added. For comfortable loading the body drops 55 millimetres at the press of a button. At 120 or 160 km\/h the body is automatically lowered by 15 mm, to reduce drag and increase stability. The lowering thresholds differ slightly depending on the mode set in Audi drive select. 

When it comes to lightweight construction, the new Audi Q7 is a benchmark in the large SUV segment. The unladen (without driver) 3.0 TDI registers 1,995 kilograms. That’s up to 325 kilograms less than the predecessor model. 

The body significantly contributes to this advancement: Its multi-material construction saves up to 71 kilograms in weight. The doors, including the complete outer shell are made of aluminium, contribute an additional saving of 24 kilograms. Engineers have also exploited large weight-saving potential in the chassis of 27 kilograms at the front and 40 kilograms at the rear suspension. The powertrain contributes a saving of 20 kilograms and the exhaust system 19 kilograms. 

Even with a trailer, the Audi Q7 cuts an excellent figure. It can haul up to 2.7 tons (on 12% gradient), and 3.5 tons with the adaptive air suspension. Joining the electrically swivelling trailer coupling on board is the trailer manoeuver assist system, which aids the driver when driving with a trailer. 

Infotainment and Audi connect 

The standard MMI navigation plus with MMI touch brings along a rich array of equipment. It includes a DVD drive, two card readers, a flash memory, Audi sound system, Audi music interface with two USB ports, a Bluetooth interface and the 8.3-inch high-resolution monitor. The MMI navigation plus with MMI touch provides access to the smartphone voice control, displays emails from the cell phone and reads them aloud. It cooperates closely with many assistance and safety systems in the new Audi Q7. 

Together with the standard MMI navigation plus with MMI touch, the Audi Q7 optionally has the Audi virtual cockpit on board – a 12.3-inch TFT screen with a resolution of 1,440 x 540 pixels, displaying razor-sharp, fascinatingly detailed images. The needle of the rev counter, for example, is recalculated 60 times per second, so as to be absolutely fluid in operation. 

For sophisticated sound system fans, the new Audi Q7 optionally offers a choice between two systems from Bose and Bang & Olufsen, respectively. Both offer the new 3D sound. Two (Bose) or four (Bang & Olufsen) additional speakers in the A-pillars provide the spatial dimension of height, lending the music an airy quality, as if played in an open space from a large virtual stage. 

The Audi tablet for rear seat entertainment with its high-resolution 10.1-inch screen (1,920 x 1,200 pixels) is a newly tailored and flexible infotainment system. Connected to MMI navigation plus via Wi-Fi, it affords access to the Radio, Media, Navigation and Car Functions menus. The data transfer runs in both directions – for example, the rear passengers can send a planned route to the driver, and conversely the driver can start a radio or media program for them from MMI navigation plus. The sound output occurs through the on-board sound system or headphones. 

The Audi tablet, which uses the Android operating system, supports Near Field Communication (NFC) technology for transmitting data from the smartphone by proximity. It has 32 gigabytes of internal memory and can be expanded by a microSD card for additional memory. The technical core is the new, super-fast Tegra processor 40 from NVIDIA. 

The Audi tablet also provides access to the Internet – to approximately one million apps and games, movies and music, audiobooks, eBooks and office applications. The integrated full HD camera can be used to make a video call via Skype. After the trip, the user can take along the Audi tablet from the car for operation offline or in an external Wi-Fi network. 

Driver assistance systems 

No other model in the segment currently offers so many driver assistance systems as the new Audi Q7. Standard systems include the attention assist system, hold assist, cruise control, adjustable speed limiter, rear parking system, Audi pre-sense basic and Audi pre-sense city. 

Optional assistance systems include adaptive cruise control, night vision assist, head up display, traffic jam assist, Audi active lane assist, collision avoidance assist, rear cross traffic assist and trailer manoeuver assist. 

Another optional system for the new Audi Q7 is all-wheel steering – a technology nowhere else to be found in the SUV segment. At the rear axle is installed a steering system with electrical spindle drive and two track rods that turns the rear wheels a few degrees in the same or opposite direction relative to the front wheels, depending on the situation. 

Equipment: 

The new Audi Q7 features a significant list of standard equipment, as follows: 

Audi Q7 3.0 TDI 183 kW quattro tiptronic

[ source : Audi ]. Audi e-tron Quattro SUV concept: An electric Q6 in disguise. It's not just Porsche targeting Tesla (with its Mission E concept). As the Californian electric motoring brand turned up to the Frankfurt Auto Show without its new Tesla Model X SUV (because, hey, launching a car at a motor show is a bit, y'know, 80s), Audi showed its intent to compete with its e-tron Quattro SUV concept. Mobbed throughout the entire Frankfurt show, the e-tron Quattro previews what many believe will become a production Audi Q6. A low-roof, slightly more rakish than the Q7, but instead of the 3.0 TDI under the hood, you're going to get a fully electric, 300-mile range battery car that will go toe-to-toe with the Tesla. There's just one problem with Audi's plan: you can order the Tesla Model X now, whereas the production version of this Audi won't be around until 2017, more likely 2018 at the earliest. Audi e-tron SUV concept preview: Worth the wait? While we know it's easy to get wound up about concepts, trust us on this one – a Q6, and electric Audi SUVs are definitely coming. And while they (yes, we reckon eventually there'll be several sizes to suit your brood and budget) won't have quite as many chrome details or 4K screens as this concept, they're likely to do all that Audi's traditionally do well (look good, be great to live with, have smart and intuitive tech content) while doing the zero emission thing too. So if you're keen on the idea of family space, a high ride and planet-hugging, emission-free lack of guilt, should you wait for this or sign for the Tesla? Pocket-lint Depends on your existing predisposition. It's beginning to look like a game of top trumps this. So while the Tesla has its flacon door, the Audi counters with some cool aero details – like the rear tail spoiler which extends at speed; and the pop-out, vertical separation elements that contribute to give a drag factor of just 0.25cd (pretty impressive for a 4.8m long SUV with a massive frontal area; by comparison the new A4 scores 0.24cd). Audi talks up both efficiency and performance in its blurb about the e-tron SUV concept. But what does that mean in reality when a production car lands? The range target of just over 300 miles per charge should be no problem, while a 0-60mpg time of sub 5-seconds might not match Tesla but ought to be fast enough in any SUV. Just don't expect to achieve both at the same time. Rather like Porsche, Audi was trumpeting the speed in which the e-tron SUV concept will be able to recharge. Via its DC system (you can use AC too) its battery can be fully recharged from flat in just 50 minutes. Oh, and the roof is made of solar panels to keep things ticking over. Pocket-lint Audi e-tron SUV concept preview: Something, something, Technik Being an Audi, the e-tron SUV concept wouldn't get out of the starting blocks without a full suite of the latest technologies. And while the tick-boxing is impressive - OLED cockpit displays all round, including in the door cards; Laser-matrix headlamps; LTE module for connectivity - the most interesting feature of the e-tron is its zFAS piloted driving capabilities. With Audi at the forefront of the development of autonomous car technologies, it was keen to show off the e-tron SUV concept as having radar sensors, cameras, laser scanners and ultra-sonic sensors which all make it ""piloted driving"" capable. In other words, it can basically drive for you by constantly 3D-modelling its surrounding and supporting your efforts even when you have the wheel. Concept car puff? No, Audi is nearly ready for the real world with this stuff: the A7 it drove from San Francisco to this year's Consumer Electronics Show tells you all you need to know. Driverless cars are incoming, they're just not exactly going to be called that for legal reasons. So expect the production Q6 e-tron you can buy in 2018 to really be able to take the load off. Pocket-lint Audi e-tron SUV concept preview: A new take on Audi design All this is wrapped in a car that speaks strongly of Audi brand values, and feels pretty much on-point, but doesn't have quite the ""photocopier at 110 per cent"" look like some of the brand's other recent efforts managed. Thank a new design director and a slight change in direction for that. The e-trone Quattro SUV concept is a little more bling for Audi: the grille shape different, there's more chrome, the wheel arches are more accentuated. Yet somehow it doesn't reek of aggression: the low roof and raked rear giving it a whiff of a high-riding estate car that manages to dial back on some of the nastiness inherent to many SUVs. The interior is a place you'll want to sit and revel in the technology too. The specification described coming together in a neat mix, without the plonked-in quality of Tesla's 17-inch centre touch screen (ok, so we love the Tesla screen, but the Audi looks even better). But then you could say the Audi lacks the wow factor of that idea too. First Impressions If you're still trying to answer the ""Audi or Tesla?"" question when it comes to electric then it comes down to this: do you buy into the idea of the Californian, Silicon-Valley way of thinking right now, or re-think from the ground up and follow the very Germanic, logical way in three years' time? We would expect the Audi to cost less in its Q6 form-to-be than the Tesla Model X too. But both cars have (or will have) their merits: Tesla has the advantage of being first, while Audi will counters with a design that feels far better resolved. The ultimate winner? Place your bets now. We'll revisit this one in 2018.. VW Scandal ‘An Awful Lot Of Fuss’, Says F1 Boss. Speaking to Sky Sports News, Mr Ecclestone said it was ‘strange’ that the company had been ‘picked on’ for using illegal software to deceive emissions tests. 
 
‘I think we’re making an awful lot of fuss about this,’ he said. 
 
‘When I think about this, and all the trucks that are charging around America – and buses, and generators all running on diesel – and there doesn’t seem to be any control over that. 
 
‘It’s strange that they’ve sort of picked on somebody that’s using a diesel engine in cars.’ 
 
The German carmaker admitted last week that it used a special device to fool US emissions testing for its diesel vehicles. 
 
The device is able to detect when cars are undergoing tests, and can switch the vehicle to a low emission mode in order to achieve more favourable results. 
 
Some 11 million Volkswagen diesel cars built since 2008 are affected by the scandal. 
 
Audi, which is a subsidiary of Volkswagen, has also admitted that 2.1 million of its cars were fitted with emission cheating software . 
 
According to an Audi spokesman, around 1.42 million Audi vehicles in Western Europe are fitted with the device, with 577,000 in Germany. 
 
Another 13,000 Audi cars in the US are affected. 
 
Vehicle lines involved include the Audi A1, A3, A4, A5, A6 and the TT, Q3 and Q5 models. 
 
Reports suggest the research and development chief of Audi, along with those of Volkswagen’s core passenger car division and sports car maker Porsche, have been put on leave. 
 
All three companies have declined to comment. 
 
The CEO of the Volkswagen Group,  Martin Winterkorn, was forced to resign over the revelations after almost nine years in the job and was replaced by Matthias Müller, who has been the chief of another Volkswagen subsidiary, Porsche, since 2010. 
 
German investigators subsequently announced they have started an investigation into Winterkorn, which will focus on ‘allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data’.

1,bmw,"Inside the brain of sustainability reporting. x Inside the brain of sustainability reporting
Jeff GowdyThursday, September 3, 2015 - 1:30am
The Big Pivot, Winston Eco-Strategies, LLC Corporate sustainability reporting has evolved. Sustainability reporting has gone through several waves of evolution over the past decade.
These waves have flowed from simple website posting of information to the creation of Corporate Social Responsibility\/Sustainability reports to reporting across the value chain (from suppliers to customers). Over the years, I have described these transitions at conferences.
Now, we are seeing a fourth wave arrive in integrated reporting: the consolidation of sustainability information and data into normal company reporting activities such as annual reports.
This is occurring for a variety of reasons, from making it easier for stakeholders to find key information to sending a signal to the investment community that sustainability is a core component of company operations.
With this trend, companies seeking to become leaders in reporting must ask themselves three key questions:Are we covering the full spectrum of environmental, social, governance (ESG) and financial (F) metrics?Are we meeting and exceeding our stakeholders’ expectations for reporting?To what level is our ESGF reporting representative of truly integrating sustainability into our company’s strategy?
These are questions of breadth and depth of reporting, and no one company is doing it at exactly the same level, quality or approach as the next. So how can we know who is doing it the “best” if everyone is doing it differently, and what does “best” mean anyway?
Let’s investigate.Where reports lie on the 'focus' spectrum
I decided to devise a system to help me decipher the types of reports out there. This system is based on the breadth of issues covered (ESGF), what type and location of reports are being produced and where the Global Fortune 500 fall within these categories.
Here is the system:
All data references come from PivotGoals.com, a free database site provided by Winston Eco-Strategies, which includes 3,500 ESG goals set by the world’s largest companies. Data is as of March. The author is project manager of PivotGoals.com.
Most focused: Integrated into annual reports (19% of Global Fortune 500)
Those at the most focused level (19 percent of the Global Fortune 500) cover ESG and F metrics. Moreover, only 1 percent have secured the third-party Integrated Reporting (IR) Standard. This puts these companies in a leadership position. Being a part of the Integrated Reporting Network provides access to knowledge and experiences different from other reporting leaders. Check out GDF Suez, Diageo and Coca-Cola’s integrated reports as prime examples.
These companies with the highest level of focus, such as Japan Post Holdings and L’Oreal, still cover ESGF, but the data is integrated into their annual report, signaling to shareholders that sustainability is core to their business. From 2013 to 2014, about 17 percent of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) sector winners did integrated reporting. One company adhered to integrated reporting and three companies integrated their ESG reporting into their annual report.
More focus: Multi-dimensional ESG reports (32%)
This group typically does standalone sustainability reports covering ESG metrics, including BMW, and are following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Standards, a well-established and respected reporting benchmark. Companies with “more focus” such as Toyota are producing a sustainability report on some level, but not necessarily following any recognized standards.
About a third of GF500 companies fall within this category, because they likely find it simpler to compile all of their ESG data into one report and deal about the financial reporting separately. Sixty-two percent of DJSI sector winners do multi-dimensional ESG reports, showing that the standalone sustainability report is still the most common option even amongst the leaders.
Some focus: Single dimension environmental and\/or CSR reports (38%)
A good chunk of companies take the approach of either producing multiple, smaller reports on specific topics (Aeon) or hosting sustainability data only on their website (United Technologies). Twenty-one percent of DJSI sector winners report at this single dimension level of one or more reports.
No focus: No reports and\/or just a website (11%)
If a company isn’t reporting, it gets no benefits from the disclosure process. But what it might get is flak from its stakeholders for not reporting — this could manifest in the form of receiving a shareholder resolution to produce a sustainability report, negative media coverage or activist campaigns against it for not being adequately transparent. No DJSI sector winner only reports via website.What are the takeaways?
Those opting for Integrated Reporting Standards are on the cutting edge for sustainability reporting. If you aren’t there yet, work your way up to and learn from those leading the charge. Part of what makes IR so attractive to stakeholders is this idea of “data centrality,” which offers consolidated data to stakeholders in one easy-to-access and easy-to-analyze location. Moreover, an integrated report indicates a much more integrated strategy to get sustainability embedded into the core of the business.
If you are within the group of common reporters doing standalone sustainability reports (ESG), take note that those companies receiving the highest “focus” designation in my grading system are those whose reporting adheres to the leading third party standards for that level of reporting. In fact, this type of standalone sustainability report is the standard among DSJI leaders, but the integrated annual report is moving its way into the norm.
And if you’re just beginning to explore the idea of reporting, know that any transparency is good transparency in the sustainability space. You’ve just got to get your feet wet, jump on the wave and start reporting at the level your company is capable of today.

BMW 225xe Active Tourer Coming In 2016. Want a BMW i8 but can’t afford one? Perhaps something in the compact crossover category might fit your budget better. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer has been selling well, and so the company has decided to take the powertrain from the i8, turn it around, install it in that car, and call it the BMW 225xe Active Tourer. 
 

 
It gets BMW’s 136 horsepower, 1.5 liter, three-cylinder engine mounted transversely at the front to power the front wheels through a six-speed automatic. It also gets an 88 horsepower electric motor to power the rear wheels through a two-speed transmission. Together, they will move the 225xe Active Tourer to 100 km\/h (62 mph) in 6.2 seconds — not bad for a front-wheel-drive hybrid crossover. 
 
The car’s onboard electronics can call upon either or both power sources to give it an intelligent all-wheel-drive system. It can send power to the front wheels, rear wheels, or all four wheels, depending on driving circumstances. The system can also work with the Dynamic Stability Control to optimize traction, acceleration, and efficiency. 
 
In the European test cycle, the 225xe uses about 2 liters of fuel to go 100 kilometers, on average. The hybrid system adds about 300 pounds to the weight of the car, which will go on sale in Europe in 2016. There is no word on price at the moment. We also don’t know if this car will make its way to the US. BMW is under pressure to meet stringent new emissions standards imposed by the European Union, but with gas prices in the US near $2.00 a gallon and trending lower, fuel economy is the furthest thing from the mind of American buyers. 
 
That’s a shame, because the BMW 225xe Active Tourer is a stylish, efficient package. Perhaps when gas prices go up — as they eventually will — this car will make it into US showrooms.

BMW: “We don’t cheat”; diesel is needed to hit CO2 targets; call for WLTP and RDE. « Audi’s e-tron quattro EV: evolutionary powertrain with a dash of revolution for production in 2018; MLB evo |Main| ICCT update finds real-world vehicle fuel economy gap continues to widen in Europe to 40% »Print this post BMW: “We don’t cheat”; diesel is needed to hit CO2 targets; call for WLTP and RDE25 September 2015As the Volkswagen emission testing scandal threatens to spill over onto other automakers, BMW yesterday issued a sharp statement in response to a report in Auto Bild suggesting emissions from an X3 test were out of the norm. “The BMW Group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests. We observe the legal requirements in each country and fulfill all local testing requirements. In other words, our exhaust treatment systems are active whether rolling on the test bench or driving on the road. Clear, binding specifications and processes are in place through all phases of development at the BMW Group in order to avoid wrongdoing.” BMW noted that in two studies carried out by the ICCT, results confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested comply with the legal requirements concerning NOx emissions. No discrepancies were found in the X5 between laboratory-test and field-test NOx emissions. BMW said it was not familiar with test results that would suggest otherwise. The company said it was contacting the ICCT and asking for clarification of the test referenced by the press report. BMW further said that it would discuss testing procedures with the relevant authorities and make its vehicles available for testing at any time. BMW also took the opportunity to speak strongly in support of diesel in the context of the coming 2020 emission targets in Europe. Policymakers worldwide, and in particular in the European Union, are setting tough standards for CO2 and other emissions. The 2020 targets in Europe can only be fulfilled through extensive use of modern diesel engines and further electrification. The progress achieved so far in CO2 reduction in Europe is largely due to the use of diesel technology. Meeting future requirements will not be feasible without diesel drive trains, since a diesel engine emits roughly 15 to 20% less CO2 on average than a comparable petrol engine. At the BMW Group, we have invested a great deal in recent years in refining and optimizing diesel technology as part of our EfficientDynamics program. At BMW, diesel vehicles accounted for 38% of vehicles sold worldwide last year: Europe 80%; Germany 73%; US 6%. This represents approx. 20,000 vehicles in the US in 2014. The Euro 6 emissions standard, which took effect on 1 September 2015 and is binding for all new vehicle registrations, improves both environmental and consumer protection. To bridge the gap between test results and real-life fuel consumption and emissions, the European Union is working on a new test cycle (WLTP) and an emissions test for real driving situations, known as “real driving emissions” or RDE. We support the swift introduction of the new regulations to create clarity for consumers and the industry as quickly as possible.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK stocks ended lower Thursday, with commodities-related stocks once again dragging on the FTSE 100, while Wall Street also was lower as investors showed caution ahead of a speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. 

The FTSE 100 index ended down 1.2% at 5,961.49 points, the FTSE 250 closed down 0.9% at 16,514.53, and the AIM All-Share finished down 0.3% at 728.89.

In Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt both lost 1.9%.

Wall Street also was lower at the London close, with the Dow 30 down 1.4%, the S&P 500 down 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.6%.

Market participants were looking ahead to a speech by Yellen, who will be speaking at 2200 BST at the University of Massachusetts Amherst about inflation dynamics and monetary policy. 

""Yellen has an opportunity to provide more clarity when she speaks today, something she clearly failed to do last week,"" said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam. 

""If she continues to talk up the threat of emerging markets and the existence of deflationary pressures, we could see markets continue to push back rate-hike expectations into next year,"" the Oanda analyst said. ""Already the markets are pricing in only around a 35% chance that rates will rise this year, if she still intends to hike and not cause too much market turmoil, she needs to start sending a clear message.""

The comments from Yellen will follow a mixed set of economic data from the US on Thursday. 

The number of people filing first-time unemployment claims in the US edged up less than expected for the week ended September 19, according to government data.

The US Labor Department said initial jobless claims came in at 267,000 for the week ended September 19. This was up 3,000 from the previous week's figure of 264,000, while economists had expected the figure to come in at 275,000.

However, continuing jobless claims for the week ended September 12 rose to 2.242 million, while economists had expected a decrease to 2.235 million from the previous reading of 2.237 million. 

US new home sales continued to surge in August, as buyers took advantage of low interest rates and better employment prospects. New home sales rose 5.7% at an annual rate of 552,000 in August, according to the Census Bureau. Economists were forecasting that new-home sales had risen by only 1.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 515,000.

Meanwhile, US durable goods orders fell 2% in August, according to statistics released by the US Department of Commerce. This matched the expectation of economists. However, the 2.2% increase initially reported for July was revised lower to show a 1.9% increase.

A strong dollar and lackluster global economy hurt demand for big-ticket items from the US, particularly jet aircraft. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders were flat in August, with economists having expected a rise of 0.1%

""Today's weak durable goods figures are perhaps a sign that Fed chair Janet Yellen was right to sit on her hands with regard to the interest rate rise,"" said Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. ""However, it will be interesting to see how the furore around German autos this week affects the US durable goods data in the coming months."" 

Volkswagen shares gave back the gains seen earlier in the session and ended up just 0.6%, after Chief Executive Martin Winterkom resigned on Wednesday to take responsibility for the emissions testing scandal that has played havoc with VW reputation and market value. In first three days of the week, VW shares shed almost a third of their value.

Meanwhile, shares in VW peer BMW closed down 5.2% in Frankfurt after a German magazine, Auto Bild, reported that the X3 xDrive 20d sport utility vehicle emitted as much as 11 times the European limit for air pollution in a road test. BMW responded by saying there is no system in its cars that responds to tests differently than it would operate on the road.

""The BMW Group has not manipulated [emission tests], and we comply in every country with both legal requirements and local test requirements,"" the Munich-based company said.

German business sentiment improved unexpectedly in September, the Munich-based Ifo Institute said. The Ifo Business Climate Index rose to 108.5 in September from 108.3 in August. It was forecast to fall to 107.9.

However, CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson warned that this survey was done before the Volkwagen scandal broke. Hewson said that ""given the repercussions this event is likely to have on German supply chains...if the survey were done now, the result would quite likely be very different.""

On the London Stock Exchange, miners took a hit. Glencore, down 8.0%, Anglo American, down 4.5%, and Antofagasta, down 2.2%, were among the worst blue-chip performers. 

Oil-related stocks ended also fell as crude oil prices failed to recover from Wednesday's decline. Brent oil stood at USD47.67 at the London close Thursday, after reaching a peak of USD50.22 on Wednesday before sharply reversing. West Texas Intermediate was at USD44.38, after touching a high of USD47.08 on Wednesday. 

Royal Dutch Shell 'A' shares ended down 2.5%, BP closed down 2.0% and BG Group down 0.6%.

However, gold miners shone, with Randgold Resources, up 5.5%, and Fresnillo, up 3.4%, leading the FTSE 100 gainers, as the price of the yellow metal rose to USD1,154.80 an ounce from a low Thursday of USD1,130.80.

Lloyds Banking Group closed up 1.6%. Directors of the Financial Conduct Authority will hold crunch talks about the imposition of a deadline to draw a line under the GBP25 billion payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, Sky News reported.

The report said the city regulator will discuss the merits of a so-called time-bar exercise as part of a scheduled board meeting. Banks have already set aside close to GBP30 billion for PPI compensation, with the state-backed Lloyds responsible for almost half that sum.

In the FTSE 250, sugar and sweeteners company Tate and Lyle closed up 3.3% after Liberum upgraded it to Buy from Sell.

Thomas Cook Group shares ended up 2.7%. The travel operator said its summer holiday sales were in line with its expectations in spite of the terrorist attack which hit Tunisia in June and curtailed holidays to the country. It also said it has made an encouraging start to the winter, allowing it to reiterate its earnings guidance for the full year.

It said that all markets performed in line, with Northern Europe achieving particularly strong trading in the second half of the year. Overall bookings were up 2% in the summer season, but average selling prices declined 2%. Thomas Cook said the summer season was 91% sold, in line with the same time last year.

Among mid-cap fallers, Poundland Group dropped 13% at 268.00p. The company raised GBP50 million through the placing of 17.9 million shares at 280.00 pence per share, in order to fund its acquisition of 99p Stores, and said that it expects core pretax profit for its full financial year to meet market expectations, although it will be weighted towards the second half.

In the corporate calendar Friday, Judges Scientific releases half-year results and CVS Group publishes full-year results.

In the economic calendar, French Consumer Confidence is due at 0745 BST. In the US, Gross Domestic Product is expected at 1330 BST. Markit's US services and composite Purchasing Manager's indices are due at 1445 BST. At the same time, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard participates in a discussion on ""New Directions in Monetary Policy"" before the Global Interdependence Center in St. Louis. 

By Daniel Ruiz; danielruiz@alliancenews.com. BMW to showcase 4 production plug-in hybrids at IAA in Frankfurt; new 225xe. BMW is using the upcoming IAA in Frankfurt to showcase four production BMW brand plug-in hybrid models from different vehicle segments—one newly announced. BMW eDrive is the new drive system technology used in all the electrically powered vehicles from BMW i and the plug-in hybrid models from BMW. Alongside BMW TwinPower Turbo technology for combustion engines, intelligent lightweight design and optimized aerodynamics, BMW eDrive technology is therefore one of the most important elements in the EfficientDynamics strategy designed to increase power and further reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. 
 
Coinciding with the world premiere of the new generation BMW 7 Series, BMW is highlighting the plug-in hybrid variant of the luxury sedan, the BMW 740e ( earlier post ). The plug-in hybrid BMW 330e ( earlier post ) with plug-in hybrid drive is being added to the model line-up for the new BMW 3 Series. Also sharing the stand will be a newly announced plug-in hybrid from the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, the BMW 225xe. Together with the soon-to-be-launched BMW X5 xDrive40e ( earlier post ) also on display at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, the BMW eDrive technology initially developed for BMW i cars will be available for BMW models spanning four different vehicle segments in 2016. 
  
BMW 225xe. The BMW 225xe, arriving in spring 2016, pairs a 100 kW\/136 hp 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine with 65 kW electric traction motor and a 7.7 kWh Li-ion battery pack. Maximum all-electric range is 41 kilometers (25 miles). Driving the rear wheels with the electric motor and the front wheels with the combustion engine’s power produces an electrified all-wheel-drive system that is distinct in the BMW 225xe’s segment and promises outstanding traction in all weathers, especially in adverse conditions. The combustion engine sends its power to the front wheels via a six-speed Steptronic transmission and delivers up to 220N·m (162 lb-ft) of torque. 
  

BMW 225xe. Click to enlarge. 
The high-voltage starter-generator takes on a multi-tasking role in the
BMW 225xe. Integrated via a belt drive, it starts up the combustion engine and can provide a brief power boost when accelerating from a standstill with its peak torque of 150 N·m (111 lb-ft). It also serves as a generator under braking and on the overrun and uses brake energy recuperation to feed energy back into the 7.7 kWh lithium-ion battery. In addition, the combustion engine uses the integrated high-voltage starter-generator to charge the batteries during a journey, if required. 
 
The plug-in hybrid drive has an overall system output of 165 kW\/224 hp and peak torque of up to 385 Newton meters (284 lb-ft). Average fuel consumption (combined) in the BMW 225xe is a 2.1–2.0 liters\/100 km, which equates to CO 2 emissions (combined) of 49–46 g\/km (in the EU test cycle). Acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h (62 mph) takes 6.7 seconds.

Figures here are for the base 740e. 
In addition to the Driving Experience Control switch—with its SPORT, COMFORT and ECO PRO settings—familiar from other BMW models, the eDrive button in the center console offers three driving modes: AUTO eDRIVE, MAX eDRIVE and SAVE BATTERY. 
 
AUTO eDRIVE is the basic setting activated when the car is started. It ensures the combustion engine and electric motor work together to optimum effect in all driving situations and gives a pure-electric top speed of 80 km\/h (50 mph). 
 
MAX eDRIVE allows the car to run on the electric drive system alone up to a speed of 125 km\/h (78 mph). 
 
With SAVE BATTERY, the charge of the high-voltage battery can be maintained or, if it’s already depleted, raised to over
50% during a journey—so that the available electric range can be used later in urban areas, for example. 

BMW ConnectedDrive also helps lower fuel consumption. In the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer with eDrive, the ConnectedDrive package adds the proactive energy management function to the mix, which responds to the driving style and route profile to ensure the plug-in hybrid drive system is used as efficiently as possible. 
 
BMW 330e. The plug-in hybrid drive system pairs a 65 kW electric motor with a four-cylinder combustion engine, which develops 135 kW\/184 hp and 290 N·m \/ 214 lb-ft of torque. Combined average fuel consumption in the NEDC cycle is 2.1–1.9 litres per 100 kilometers, with CO 2 emissions coming in at 49– 44 g\/km. 
  
 
BMW 330e. Click to enlarge. 
With a system output of 185 kW\/252 hp and peak torque of
420 N·m \/ 310 lb-ft, the BMW 330e accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h (62 mph) in 6.1 seconds on the way to a top speed of 225 km\/h (140 mph). In everyday driving conditions, a range of up to 600 kilometers (373 miles) is within reach. 
 
The electric motor and combustion engine send their power to the sedan’s rear wheels via a standard-fitted eight-speed Steptronic transmission. The arrangement of the electric motor in front of the transmission allows the transmission ratios to be used in all-electric mode as well. This means a torque converter can be omitted, which partially cancels out the extra weight of the additional drive unit. 
 
The electric motor supplements the power from the combustion engine with 100 N·m \/ 74 lb-ft of torque and can deliver a brief extra burst—depending on the position of the accelerator—of up to 250 N·m \/ 184 lb-ft. 
 
The battery has a total capacity of 7.6 kWh, which enables an all-electric and therefore locally emission-free range of around 40 kilometers (25 miles). 
 
There is a choice of three driving modes: AUTO eDRIVE, MAX eDRIVE and SAVE BATTERY. 
 
AUTO eDRIVE ensures the combustion engine and electric motor work together to optimum effect in all driving situations and allows an all-electric top speed of 80 km\/h (50 mph). This mode is activated automatically as the default setting every time the car is started up. 
 
In MAX eDRIVE mode the BMW 330e uses the car’s electric power only, drawing on the electric drive system’s full output. A top speed of 120 km\/h (75 mph) is possible. 
 
SAVE BATTERY mode allows the battery’s energy stores to be deliberately maintained—or increased again if the charge level has dropped below 50%. This energy can then be used for pure-electric driving, on a part of the journey running through city streets, for example. 

eDrive. BMW eDrive offers the option of driving on electric power alone and therefore with zero local emissions yet at the same time can cover long distances when the two drive systems team up. BMW eDrive technology delivers dynamic acceleration off the line thanks to the electric motor; an eBoost function pools the torque of both drive systems under acceleration. 
 
Developed initially for the all-electric BMW i3 and BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car, the modular structure of BMW eDrive technology is adaptable for use in various vehicle concepts and segments. The fine-tuning of vehicle-specific elements, such as the battery cells, cooling management, power electronics and operating strategy, has involved the transfer of knowledge from the BMW i3 and BMW i8 to the development of new BMW eDrive models. 
 
BMW eDrive technology essentially spans the electric motor, the lithium-ion high-voltage battery and the power electronics. An important element of the operating strategy is the need-oriented use of externally sourced and recuperated electric energy to maximize the vehicle’s efficiency. The components of the BMW eDrive architecture are tailored to each particular vehicle concept and can be combined with four- and three-cylinder gasoline engines as well as with classical rear-wheel drive, BMW xDrive or electrified all-wheel drive. 
 
The eDrive components developed as part of the BMW i projects will soon be integrated into other model ranges from the core brands. This scalable architecture also provides the platform required to offer plug-in hybrid vehicles at attractive prices on a par with those of conventionally powered variants of similar output, BMW said. 
 
The operating strategy of the plug-in hybrids is based on the vehicle starting up on electric power only. BMW’s plug-in hybrid vehicles prioritize electric mode at low and moderate speeds, which allows them to exploit the benefits of the locally emission-free electric drive system. Under greater acceleration and at higher speeds, however, the combustion engine joins in. The boost function pools the torque of both drive systems to maximise the car’s dynamic performance. 
 
BMW eDrive ensures that the combustion engine runs efficiently (electric assist) at higher speeds as well. This allows a reduction in fuel consumption on brisk cross-country or motorway runs, for example. And when the route guidance function of the car’s navigation system is activated, the proactive function initiates an anticipatory operating strategy which optimises efficiency and maximises the electric driving experience. 
 
The battery can be recharged from a domestic socket using the standard charging cable supplied or from a BMW i Wallbox (charging power: 3.7 kW). When traveling, the BMW i mobility service, ChargeNow, gives customers access to the world’s largest public charging network of more than 30,000 charging points run by partners in 22 countries.. Stocks are making a big comeback (SPY, DJI, IXIC, QQQ, CAT). Near 10:50 a.m. ET, the Dow was down 240 points, the S&P 500 was down 70 points, and the Nasdaq was down 26 points. The three indexes were down more than 1%.FinvizCaterpillar had some grim news Thursday morning: The industrial giant plans to lay off as many as 10,000 people because of what it calls ""a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors — namely in mining and energy."" This kind of language does not bode well coming from a bellwether for the economies of both China and the rest of the world. 

Caterpillar's three-month rolling sales figures have been on the decline for 33 months. The company's stock opened down 7%, and its decline subtracted at least 30 points from the Dow in early trading.FinvizWe got some economic data Thursday morning: Initial jobless claims rose less than expected last week, by 3,000 to 267,000. Durable goods orders fell 2%, while ""core"" durable goods orders fell 0.2% in August. 

And new-home sales jumped 5.7% at an annualized pace of 552,000 in August, the fastest in seven years. 

But the most anticipated event is Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's speech at 5 p.m. ET. She will be speaking on inflation at the University of Massachusetts exactly a week after the FOMC left interest rates unchanged, citing sluggish inflation and global economic concerns. 

Meanwhile, the same theme that has recently plagued markets continues, and that is uncertainty. 

""Deferral of Fed lift-off to later this year or into Q1 leaves markets treading water,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note to clients on Thursday. ""Heightened sensitivity to the ebb and flow of data is likely."" 

The vehicle-emissions scandal deepened overnight as we learned via a German media report that BMW's X3 Xdrive 20d exceeded regulatory standards by 11 times. The company denied the report, and its stock fell by as much as 8%. 

This comes one day after Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned following his admission that the company cheated rules regarding diesel emissions. VW shares were all over the place in trading, rallying 8% before giving back all the gains.

Engine:inline-6 Horsepower @ RPM:431 Displacement:3.0 L 0-60 time:4.1 sec. Top Speed:174 mph Posted on 09.20.2015 06:00 by Kirby Garlitos +   BMW has pulled the covers off of a unique 2016 BMW M3 in time for Munich’s annual Oktoberfest celebrations. The model, called the M3 “Münchner Wirte” (translated as “Munich hosts”) is a one-off creation that celebrate’s BMW’s motor racing history, particularly that of the 1981 BMW M1 Procar , and its longstanding relationship with Germany’s third-largest city.
The one-off M3 “Münchner Wirte” has a special, Munich-inspired livery similar to the one the M1 Procar sported 34 years ago. The two liveries may not be identical in nature, but they do share the same creator: Walter Maurer. The now-73-year-old German designer hand-painted the Munich-inspired livery on the M1 Procar 34 back in 1981. Since then, the livery has become one of Maurer’s most iconic creations.
BMW brought Maurer back to resurrect his livery on the four-door M3 , and give it a modern look. The end result speaks for itself; the BMW M3 “Münchner Wirte” is a real head-turner.
The BMW M3 “Münchner Wirte” will be on display at BMW Welt during Oktoberfest, which kicks off on September 17, 2015 and continues up to October 4, 2015.

Walter Maurer’s livery is the visual highlight of the exterior. Just like his work on the 1981 M1 Procar, Maurer was meticulous in creating the livery for the M3 “Münchner Wirte.” The blue-and-white twisted cords are the most prominent design feature, appearing all over the M3. Maurer wasn’t specific on the significance of the cords, but they could signify Bavaria, the German free state that has Munich as its capital and is the home state of BMW. Blue and white are the official colors of the Bavarian flag.
Bavarian-style facade paintings are also prominently displayed on the M3 “Münchner Wirte,” depicting some of Munich’s most prominent landmarks, including Siegestor, the three-arched triumphal arch; Frankuenkirche church; BMW’s “four-cylinder” headquarters; and the Olympic Stadium, the site of the ill-fated 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Depictions of a roasted-chestnut seller and the Wiesn-Schänke beer tent at the Oktoberfest can also be found in the body of the M3.Interior

Powering the BMW M3 “Münchner Wirte” is the same 3.0-liter inline-six engine that the standard M3 has. A little tinkering of the engine nets a slightly raised output of 431 horsepower, six ponies more than the normal M3. Power is sent to the rear wheels via BMW’s M Double Clutch transmission, allowing the sports sedan to sprint from 0 to 62 mph in 4.1 seconds. BMW also fitted the special edition M3 with its M Driver’s Package, shooting the top speed up to 174 mph.Drivetrain Specifications

Seeing as it is a one-off, BMW isn’t putting a price tag on the M3 “Münchner Wirte”. But if anybody happens to be going to BMW’s museum during Oktoberfest, you’ll have the chance to see this one-off M3 in person. There have been no announcements on what BMW plans to do with the car after that, but if the fates of past one-off vehicles like the 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Concept S are any indication, don’t be surprised if the M3 “Münchner Wirte” ends up in an auction sometime in the future.Competitors2015 Mercedes-AMG C63 The Mercedes-AMG C63 is the unquestioned nemesis of the BMW M3. Both models were recipients of updates from Mercedes and BMW, respectively. Unfortunately for the M3, its updates pale in comparison to the C63. The Mercedes is not only longer and wider now than past versions, but it also has an all-new look that’s in line with Merc’s current design language.
Power also favors the C63, thanks in large part to a new 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine that produces 469 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a seven-speed AMG Speedshift transmission, helping the C63 AMG post a 0-to-60 mph sprint time of just four seconds to go with a top speed of 155 mph.
The base Mercedes-AMG C63 Sedan checks in at $63,900, a little cheaper than the $64,195 price of the base BMW M3.

One-off cars don’t get any more personalized and charismatic as the BMW M3 “Münchner Wirte.” The tribute to Munich is a great way to establish the connection between the city and BMW , which has its headquarters located there. It’s also pretty cool that Walter Maurer was able to tie-up these relationships with the upcoming Oktoberfest, considered by many as one of the most popular festivals of any kind in the world.

Press Release
BMW M GmbH is set to unveil a BMW M3 in “Münchner Wirte” livery to coincide with this year’s Oktoberfest in Munich (19 September – 4 October). The one-off car will underscore the company’s ties with motor sport in general and the city of Munich in particular. The livery design of the BMW M3 “Münchner Wirte” harks back to that of the legendary BMW M1 Procar from 1981, complete with Bavarian-style façade painting and blue and white twisted cords, along with depictions of Munich landmarks (such as the Olympic Stadium, Siegestor, Frauenkirche church and BMW’s headquarters – the “four-cylinder” building), a roast chestnut seller and the Wiesn-Schänke beer tent at the Oktoberfest.
Walter Maurer is responsible for bringing the design back to life on the current BMW M3. The designer, whose close relationship with BMW dates back several decades, created the livery for the BMW M1 Procar “Münchner Wirte” and painted it on by hand 34 years ago. “Although the two cars are very different, it was surprisingly straightforward to carry over the design from the two-door BMW M1 racer to the four-door BMW M3 Sedan,” reports Maurer.
More in common than you might think.
The new BMW M3 “Münchner Wirte” and BMW M1 Procar “Münchner Wirte” have more in common than just their eye-catching exteriors: both cars offer the benefits of a six-cylinder in-line engine with four-valve technology, rear-wheel drive and the vast pool of racing expertise amassed by BMW M GmbH. The engine powering the BMW M1 Procar racing machine developed 345 kW\/470 hp, enabled acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h (62 mph) in 4.5 seconds and powered the car to a top speed of 310 km\/h (193 mph). The cutting-edge M TwinPower Turbo engine in the BMW M3 comes close in terms of power, producing 317 kW\/431 hp to propel the sports sedan to a maximum 280 km\/h (174 mph) when the M Driver’s Package is specified and teaming up with the M Double Clutch Transmission with Drivelogic to deliver a 0 to 100 km\/h (62 mph) time of just 4.1 seconds (fuel consumption combined: 8.3 l\/100 km [34.0 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 194 g\/km)*.
The BMW M3 “Münchner Wirte” will be on display at BMW Welt during the Oktoberfest.
So how did the idea come about in the first place? “I hatched the plan to turn this very special artwork into reality in 1981, together with my good friends and long-established Munich restaurateurs Putzi Holenia and Karl Heckl, and the then head of the BMW press department, Dirk Henning Strassl,” explains Maurer. A few weeks later the BMW M1 Procar “Münchner Wirte” was lining up in the GT class at the Le Mans 24-hour race, where driving duties were shared by the three-strong line-up of Prince Leopold of Bavaria, Christian Danner and Peter Oberndorfer. The car’s special design attracted a great deal of attention and captured the imagination of many who saw it, as reflected in the number of pictures now posted online.

Postage Rates. BMW reveals three new plug-in hybrids at Frankfurt. Three new petrol-electric plug-in hybrid BMW models have made their debuts at the Frankfurt Motor Show and will launch early next year. 
 
The 225xe, 330e and 740e join the X5 xDrive40 and sleek i8 to provide BMW with a five-strong range of plug-in hybrids, with new chairman Harald Krüger promising further petrol-electric models throughout next year. 
 
The 225xe Active Tourer draws on the plug-in hybrid technology developed for the i8 sports car to offer the choice between front, rear or four-wheel drive, depending on the driving conditions. 
 
A 134bhp front-mounted turbocharged 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine sends power to the front wheels via a six-speed automatic gearbox. The combustion engine is supported by an 88bhp electric motor mounted within the rear axle, driving the rear wheels via a fixed-ratio gearbox. 
 
The 225xe can travel up to 40 kilometres on electric power alone. At a constant cruise over longer distances, it is programmed to run in front-wheel drive, with power provided exclusively by the petrol engine at speeds of up to 200kph in order to preserve the energy reserves of its 7.7kWh lithium ion battery. 
 
Under acceleration, the combustion and electric motor pool their resources to provide a combined system output of 221bhp and 284lb ft, as well as four-wheel drive, in hybrid mode. A 0-100kph time of 6.7sec is claimed. 
 
Further along the model line-up, the larger rear-wheel drive 330e saloon relies on a detuned version of the plug-in petrol-electric driveline used by the X5 xDrive40e. It uses a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and an electric motor mounted within the gearbox to provide combined outputs of 248bhp and 310lb ft along with 148.7mpg\/52.64kpl claimed combined economy and 44g\/km of CO2 emissions. The lithium ion battery provides an electric-only range of 40 kilometres. 
 
The flagship of BMW’s new plug-in hybrid line-up is the 740e. Available in standard and long-wheelbase body styles with rear-wheel drive (740e and 740Le) or in long-wheelbase form with four-wheel drive (740Le xDrive), it also draws on the plug-in hybrid system used by the X5 xDrive40e. Claimed figures for the 740e are 321bhp, 369lb ft, 134.5mpg\/47.61kpl and 49g\/km, plus a 40km electric-only range. . BMW denies manipulating or rigging diesel emission tests. German top-of-the-range carmaker BMW on Thursday denied suggestions in a newspaper report that it might have cheated in pollution tests on its diesel cars, as rival group VW has admitted to doing. 

	""The BMW group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests. We observe the legal requirements in each country and adhere to all local testing requirements,"" it said in a statement after a report in the weekly Auto Bild claimed that emissions from one of its diesel cars exceeded European Union norms 11 times.

One by one they are starting to fall. Clean Diesel is really not clean. The thorns are showing up on the rose and now the emissions chaos is striking BMW as well. Since BMW is the manufacturer of the I3 and has been investing in electric vehicle technology much more so than VW. 

Starting way back in 2009 BMW had the Mini E lease program which migrated into the Active E electric car program. Their history is clear that they have wanted to move in the Electric Car direction for some time and as with many manufacturers they are worried about consumer acceptance and business operations disruptions.

The new generation of the BMW 7 Series also boasts standout innovations when it comes to operating system and driver assistance technology. The various new features that are unprecedented in the luxury sedan segment include, for example, the extension of the iDrive system to include a touch display and BMW gesture control, Touch Command for controlling comfort and infotainment functions in the rear compartment, as well as a Remote Control Parking system. In addition to all this, BMW is also presenting the latest generation of the BMW Head-Up Display, Crossing traffic warning, the Steering and lane control assistant, active side collision protection and the Surround View system with 3D View and Panorama View in its new flagship model. 
 
Urban all-rounder that has grown in character: the new BMW X1 
 
The second generation of the BMW X1 successfully transfers the trademark qualities of a Sports Activity Vehicle to the compact segment with greater intensity than ever. The new edition of this highly popular model makes its mark with powerful proportions and clean lines in the style of its larger BMW X siblings. Inside, the new BMW X1 offers far more space for both passengers and luggage, a state-of-the-art premium ambience and sophisticated functionality. 
 
Petrol and diesel engines from the BMW Group’s latest generation of power units, an efficiency-optimised version of the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system and newly developed chassis technology combine to produce a notable increase in sportiness and ride comfort along with far greater efficiency. Equipment features available for the BMW X1 for the first time include full-LED headlights, Dynamic Damper Control, the BMW Head-Up Display that projects driving-related information onto the windscreen as in the larger BMW X models, as well as the Driving Assistant Plus system. 
 
Top seller in top shape: the new BMW 3 Series 
 
Featuring a meticulously honed design on the outside, a painstakingly refined premium feel on the inside, a revised engine line-up, a more advanced chassis and additional equipment options, the new BMW 3 Series is perfectly poised to continue an unbroken run of success in the premium mid-size segment that first started four decades ago. The BMW brand’s most popular model range with over 14 million already sold to date once again sets new standards for dynamism, efficiency and design in both BMW 3 Series Sedan and BMW 3 Series Touring guise. 
 
The choice of engines for the new BMW 3 Series comprises four petrol and seven diesel units at market launch. Depending on the particular engine variant, power is transferred via traditional rear-wheel drive or, alternatively, via the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system. The BMW 330e Sedan will furthermore be added to the line-up for the 2016 model year. This plug-in hybrid marries BMW eDrive technology with a four-cylinder petrol unit from the BMW Group’s newest engine generation. While extracting a total system output of 185 kW\/252 hp from its duo of power units, the BMW 330e returns average fuel consumption (combined) of 2.1–1.9 litres\/100 km (134.5–148.7 mpg imp) and CO2 emissions (combined) of 49–44 g\/km (in the EU test cycle). 
 
Versatile interior layout, groundbreaking drive system: the new BMW 225xe 
 
The model range for the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is also set to be expanded by the arrival of a plug-in hybrid variant in spring 2016. The BMW 225xe serves up a brand new cocktail of BMW EfficientDynamics, comfort, fun at the wheel and all-wheel-drive performance. What’s more, this matchless driving experience is combined with impressive versatility and generous levels of space in a compact-sized vehicle. The space-saving location of the lithium-ion battery underneath the rear bench means that full use can continue to be made of the boot space above. 
 
The interaction between BMW eDrive technology and a 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology makes it possible to enjoy both all-electric driving and unrestricted motoring mobility in the BMW 225xe. With a maximum electric range of 41 kilometres (25 miles), zero-local-emission driving can be experienced not just in the city, but beyond it too. Driving the rear wheels with the electric motor and the front wheels with the combustion engine’s power furthermore produces an electrified all-wheel-drive system that is quite unique in the BMW 225xe’s segment and promises outstanding traction in all weathers, especially in adverse conditions. The plug-in hybrid drive has an overall system output of 165 kW\/224 hp. Average fuel consumption (combined) in the BMW 225xe is a frugal 2.1–2.0 litres\/100 km (134.5–141.2 mpg imp), which equates to CO2 emissions (combined) of 49–46 g\/km (in the EU test cycle).

BMW i: trailblazer for electric driving pleasure and everyday usability 
 
Following the successful global launch of the purely electrically powered BMW i3 (energy consumption combined: 12.9 kWh; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g\/km) and the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car (fuel consumption combined: 2.1 l\/100 km \/ 134.5 mpg imp; CO2 emissions combined: 49 g\/km) the BMW i brand is now further cementing its status as a trailblazer for sustainable mobility with a growing variety of vehicle and mobility services. BMW i is already the brand to have won most awards during its introductory phase in the history of motoring. The inclusion of the BMW i3 in the model fleets of the premium car-sharing service, DriveNow, in the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark now offers the wider public an easy, low-cost way of trying out electric mobility for the first time. At the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, BMW i is additionally presenting the complete range of technological concepts that are ideal for everyday charging at home and in the public domain. The most recent innovation is BMW i Light and Charge – a street light from which the high-voltage battery in an electric car can also be recharged. 
 
BMW i is providing further impetus by transferring technology to current BMW brand models. All the plug-in hybrid models being exhibited by BMW at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, for instance, employ the BMW eDrive technology initially developed for BMW i cars in the form of electric motors, power electronics, high-voltage batteries and intelligent energy management. Equally, the experience with using industrially manufactured CFRP garnered during development of the BMW i cars has now helped to reduce the weight of the new BMW 7 Series luxury sedans.. 5 Stories to Go for Sept. 24.

ACCC opens Volkswagen investigation 1:47 Play video The consumer watchdog is investigating whether Australian drivers have been misled by Volkswagen. 

Sky News 26 Sep 2015 News BMW has denied rigging the computers in its diesel cars to cheat emissions tests, after respected German motoring magazine AutoBild claims to have found its X3 model blew 11 times over the legal limit. AutoBild said road testing of the X3 diesel by the International Council on Clean Transportation — the same group whose tip-off led US regulators to investigate the VW cheating scandal — found it belched out “11.88 times the Euro 6 limit for NOx emissions”.

BMW has strenuously denied the claim.

AUSTRALIA: Consumer cops launch probe “The BMW Group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests,” a statement from the company says.

“We observe the legal requirements in each country and adhere to all local testing requirements.

“When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg test bench situation) or on the road.”

BMW says the two studies carried out by the International Council on Clean Transportation have confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested did comply with the legal requirements concerning diesel emissions.

“We are not familiar with the test mentioned by AutoBild concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 during a road test. No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results,” the BMW statement said.

Originally published as. Suspicions over VW’s emissions scandal spread to rival BMW. Volkwagen’s car-emissions scandal dragged down shares of rival German auto giant BMW on Thursday amid fears that cheating on pollution tests is more widespread.

Shares of BMW skidded as much as 10 percent after German weekly Auto Bild reported that road tests by the International Council on Clean Transportation showed one of its diesel cars exceeded European emissions limits by more than 11 times.

BMW said it was not familiar with the test and would ask the ICCT for clarification, but that it “does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests,” according to a statement to the AP.

After falling nearly 10 percent on the report, BMW shares were down around 8 percent in afternoon trading in Frankfurt.

Germany’s car industry has been rocked by revelations that VW installed software to fool emissions tests in 11 million of its diesel cars.

The scandal exploded on Friday when US officials publicly accused the company of cheating and launched a probe. The EPA investigation could lead to fines totaling more than $18 billion.

The US Department of Justice has also launched a criminal probe, as has New York Attorney General Eric Scheiderman with other states likely to follow suit.

VW’s supervisory board is expected to meet Friday to discuss a replacement for CEO Martin Winterkorn, who resigned Wednesday after the scandal sparked a 35 percent drop in VW’s share price. VW also makes Porsche, Audi and Bentley.

Porsche CEO Matthias Muller is set to become the new head of VW, WSJ.com reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

VW’s US chief, Michael Horn, is also expected to leave the company in the wake of the scandal, according to several reports.. BMW shares plunge on report it broke pollution limit. (CNNMoney) -  
Another German automaker was dragged into the scandal over harmful emissions from diesel engines Thursday -- at least on the stock market. 
 
Shares in BMW slumped 8% to their lowest level in two years after a German magazine reported that at least one model had breached European pollution limits by a huge margin in road tests. 

Auto Bild said the BMW X3 xDrive 20d had produced 11 times as much nitrogen oxide as permitted in independent road tests conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation. 

The scandal erupted Friday when U.S. regulators revealed Volkswagen had cheated pollution tests on 500,000 vehicles by programming them to produce fewer emissions than they do in normal driving conditions. 

Since then, the world's biggest carmaker has admitted there could be problems with emissions in 11 million vehicles worldwide. Its shares have been slammed, CEO Martin Winterkorn has resigned, and prosecutors in the U.S. and Germany are considering legal action. 

The action by federal and California state regulators against Volkswagen had its origin in research conducted by the ICCT into emissions from three vehicles: a VW Jetta, a VW Passat, and a BMW X5. 

The Jetta and Passat cars produced way more nitrogen oxide than permitted. The BMW X5 was ""generally at or below the standard, and only exceeded it during rural uphill operating conditions,"" according to the ICCT. 

Auto Bild appears to be referring to a separate set of tests. 

""All the results indicate that this problem is not specific to VW,"" Auto Bild quoted ICCT expert Peter Mock as saying. 

BMW said it was not familiar with the BMW X3 road test mentioned in the article. 

""No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results. We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the test they carried out,"" it said in a statement. 

The company also repeated that it does not manipulate or rig any tests on its cars. 

""When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg. test bench situation) or on the road,"" BMW said. 

It's a measure of how nervous investors are about the potential fallout for European automakers that the stock was so hard hit in early dealing. It has lost about 40% since March. 

""Shares in BMW are weak again today on speculation that its diesel emissions test results may also have been doctored to appear eco-friendly and thus saleable in the world's second largest but arguably the most important car market, the U.S.,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets..

© Multimedia Investments Ltd Terms of Use\/Disclaimer .. BMW Group statement concerning the current discussion of diesel engines - updated Friday, September 25, 2015.. WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J. , Sept. 25, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- BMW Group is committed to observing the legal requirements in each country and fulfilling all local testing requirements. 

In other words, our exhaust treatment systems are active whether rolling on the test bench or driving on the road. 
   
Clear, binding specifications and processes are in place through all phases of development at the BMW Group in order to avoid wrongdoing. 

Two studies carried out by the ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation) have confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested comply with the legal requirements concerning NOx emissions. No discrepancies were found in the X5 between laboratory-test and field-test NOx emissions. 

The German magazine Auto Bild has published a clarification of their article released yesterday ( September 24 ) concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 stating: ""No evidence of emission manipulation by BMW…. The values mentioned in the document were only generated in a single, one hour-long road test. Auto BILD has no access to the details of this test trail, which might explain the discrepancies to the test cycle NEDC.""  (NEDC stands for New European Driving Cycle) 

BMW Group is willing to discuss our testing procedures with the relevant authorities and to make our vehicles available for testing at any time. 

The importance of diesel engines in achieving CO2 targets 

Policymakers worldwide, and in particular in the European Union, are setting tough standards for CO2 and other emissions. The 2020 targets in Europe can only be fulfilled through extensive use of modern diesel engines and further electrification. 

The progress achieved so far in CO2 reduction in Europe is largely due to the use of diesel technology. Meeting future requirements will not be feasible without diesel drive trains, since a diesel engine emits roughly 15 to 20 per cent less CO2 on average than a comparable petrol engine.  

At the BMW Group, we have invested a great deal in recent years in refining and optimizing diesel technology. 

At BMW, diesel vehicles accounted for 38% of vehicles sold worldwide last year: Europe 80%; Germany 73%; US 6%. This represents approx. 20,000 vehicles in the US in 2014. 

The Euro 6 emissions standard, which took effect on 1 September 2015 and is binding for all new vehicle registrations, improves both environmental and consumer protection. 

To bridge the gap between test results and real-life fuel consumption and emissions, the European Union is working on a new test cycle (WLTP) and an emissions test for real driving situations, known as ""real driving emissions"" or RDE. We support the swift introduction of the new regulations to create clarity for consumers and the industry as quickly as possible.

SOURCE  BMW North America. BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer. BMW 2 Series seven-seat Gran Tourer 
 
The a premium car for growing families. 
 
The 2 Series seven-seat Gran Tourer now means BMW really can offer a car for all occasion. 
 
Until now, BMW fans with more than three kids had little option but to get a SUV or drop downmarket - how embarressing! 
 
This BMW is for those who see a Ford Grand C-MAX, Vauxhall's Zafira or a Volkswagen Touran is too down market so it promises to be a car they not only need but rather they desire. 
 
In order to make a compact seven-seater the BMW boffins first had to drag the designers away from their much loved rear wheel drive motors into the heady world of front wheel drive.a brave step indeed.But using the new MINI hatchback architecture, BMW is able to introduce a new range of compact cars giving it access to previously untapped segments. 
 
The 2 Series Gran Tourer's main target is the family sector, with BMW predicting will make up some 60 per cent of its customer base. A further 20 per cent plus being sold to elderly buyers thanks to its upright driving position and easily access to the front seats, the rest will go to the fleet buyers wanting more space and an upmarket image. 
   
targeted buyers - families 
   
Four trims, SE, Sport, Luxury and M Sport will comprise the range, with the majority specced in popular Sport and M Sport guises. 
 
Engines range from the basic three-cylinder 216d diesel to the range-topping 220d with four-wheel drive. In between the two you'll find a 218i and 220i petrol, as well as a 218d diesel. 
 
The two more powerful diesels are expected to make up the bulk of sales, though the smaller 216d that boasts the most impressive fuel economy and emissions. Six-speed manual and eight-speed automatic gearboxes are on offer across the range.. 
 
BMW's claim that the 2 Series Gran Tourer is the only premium, seven-seat compact MPV available with all-wheel drive is correct. 
 
What's it like inside? 
 
Roomy thats for sure with, BMW making the Gran Tourer 21cm longer than it's predesessor the Active Tourer and 5cm taller. 
 
As a result, the Gran Tourer has a good amount of front space for tall adults, and room enough for two more in the outside seats of the middle row, provided both parts of its 60\/40 split configuration are as far back as possible. 
 
Access to the middle row is good, thanks to rear doors that open wide. and the sixth and seventh seats can be pulled up from the boot floor using one hand. Folding down and sliding forward an outside middle row seat gives good access to the third row but you won't want to be in there for long as an adult. Shoulder room is good, and the seat bases are individual, but even for teenagers head, leg and foot room is very tight. 
 
With the third row folded away flat and the middle row slid right back, there's a 560-litre boot that has a wide opening, a flush boot lip and a usefully square shape. Sliding the middle row forwards increases boot space to 720 litres, but decreases legroom. 
 
The middle row seats are folded electronically almost flat 40\/20\/40 using buttons on the boot walls. This is a standard feature and one that works well, increasing boot space with all seats down to 1820 litres. The front passenger seat can also be folded flat to leave a 2.6m-long load bay. 
 
Standard equipment is very generous. DAB radio, sat-nav, Bluetooth, climate control, an electronic tailgate, alloy wheels and city braking technology can be found on every car. 
 
What's it like to drive? 
 
The 2.0i petrol which we ran feels spritely, although with less torque to call on the gearbox is more eager to change down in search of higher revs. The petrol is refined, staying quieter when worked hard and sending little vibration back through the controls. 
 
The Gran Tourer's steering feels precise and its front-end is agile - light to the touch but weighting up quickly in the corners - but you're always aware that the body following it is tall and heavy. At sensible speeds along winding roads, it's better than most seven-seaters, but there's no doubt it starts to feel out of its depth at times.. 
 
Should I buy one? 
 
The Gran Tourer looks expensive, especially in the version we drove so far, but the fact that it's of high quality inside and very well equipped, and its engines are competitively clean and frugal, work in its favour. 
 
Alround this is a well appointed motor oozing style and class and the all important BMW badge.

© 2015 AFP. Rumor: Apple Aiming To Bring Electric Car to Market in 2019, Says Inside Sources. It’s known for its high-end products, disruptive attitudes to conventional business practices and earlier this year celebrated having the most profitable quarter of any company in history. 
 
But come 2019, tech giant Apple will become a car maker too with the launch of its first car. 
 
The Apple Car looks more likely than ever before — but it’ll be hard for Apple to enter the automotive market. 
 
That’s according to  The Wall Street Journal , which claimed earlier today that the world-famous designer brand is on the brink of turning its skunkworks automotive project into a mainstream product in less than four years’ time. 
 
Citing anonymous inside sources at the company,  The Wall Street Journal says that Apple’s project Titan — Apple’s top-secret program to design and build an all-electric car — is now officially a ‘committed project’ at the Californian company. What’s more, claim the sources, project leaders have been given the go-ahead by Apple bosses to triple the number of staff working on project Titan, expanding its workforce from 600 engineers to more than 1800. 
 
The same sources say Apple is hoping to have a targeted ship date some time in 2019, meaning Apple’s as-yet unnamed electric car will be entering the automotive market a year or two after Tesla’s upcoming Model 3 mid-sized sedan and the next-generation Nissan LEAF are expected to launch. 
 
At the moment, specifics on Apple’s first production car are somewhat sketchy at best, but it’s worth noting that while  The Wall Street Journal  has been reporting on this particular story  more than eight months  and has been accurate in the past with other Apple-related rumors. 
 
Apple CEO Tim Cook, like most of the Apple Board, is said to be pushing the development of an Apple car. 
 
In keeping with its standard practices, Apple is currently declining to comment on speculation regarding an Apple-branded electric car. 
 
Despite its silence on the matter however, Apple has been rather active of late with the number of new hires from the automotive industry. While executive crossover between the consumer electronics and auto industry isn’t exactly new, Apple’s recent hires have included Johan Jungwirth, former president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz’ North America’s research and development team as well asDoug Betts, former head of quality control at Fiat Chrysler. 
 
Other hires in recent months include experts from Tesla Motors, as well as experts in the field of autonomous driving, machine learning and automotive production. While  The Wall Street Journal says Apple’s first car will likely have semi-autonomous rather than fully-autonomous capabilities, Apple’s ultimate goal is clear: to produce an autonomous zero-emission vehicle which integrates seamlessly with Apple’s existing hardware and software ecosystem. 
 
If Apple is successful, it would give the company a unique and commanding position, intersecting the tech and automotive worlds. What’s more, its nearest rival, software giant Google, recently confirmed that it has no interest in becoming an automaker, despite its prominent position in the world of autonomous vehicle research and development. 
 
That leaves Apple with one other rival, Silicon Valley automaker Tesla Motors. While the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X luxury electric cars are indeed the gold standard for their feature-reach Internet-enabled connectivity, semi-autonomous autopilot functionality, zero-emissions range and performance, even Tesla lacks the same fully-integrated ecosystem that an Apple-branded electric car could offer. 
 
Developing a car is not like developing a new smart phone. 
 
But as we’ve said before, developing a car from scratch isn’t easy. While Apple certainly has the money on hand needed to develop and build a brand-new self-driving electric car — more than $203 billion at last count — entering the automotive business isn’t going to be as simple as bringing a new iPhone to market. 
 
The first of these is production cycles. While Apple is used to developing its smartphones and computers on a one or two year cycle, automotive production cycles are typically much longer. Even Tesla, whose production cycles follows an ethos atypical for the automotive industry– namely that features are added when they are ready to be added rather than waiting for a new model year refresh — is using the same basic chassis and panel design for new Model S cars than original 2012 model year cars. 
 
The second is the various legislative and regulatory hurdles which must be overcome before a new car can reach the marketplace. While Apple is more than familiar with the various legislative hurdles for consumer electronics and cellphone communication devices, the automotive world comes with its own completely new set of requirements which must be met — and which will take Apple a while to successfully negotiate. These include everything from Federal safety standard compliance to crash-safety tests, range testing and of course, compliance with individual state regulations too. 
 
Crash tests are just one thing which Apple will have to contend with. 
 
Finally, in order to become successful in the automotive marketplace, Apple will need to either build and staff its own production facility or find a third-party automotive factory willing to build its cars under license. While rumors that Apple was looking to work with BMW have yet to prove anything more than conjecture, working with a third-party automaker would make it harder for Apple to dynamically adapt to the rest of the industry in the way that Tesla Motors can. In order to truly compete with Tesla, it would need to do just that. 
 
What does it all mean? We’re still on the fence about Apple’s prospective automotive endeavors — but it’s clear that Apple is serious about entering into the automotive market some way or other. 
 
And when it does, the rest of the automotive world should be ready for a fight. 
 
 . BMW hybrid cars launch date confirmed for 2016. Plug-in petrol-electric models of the 2, 3 and 7 Series BMWs will be available to British buyers in the first part of 2016 after being unveiled at this month’s Frankfurt Show. 
 
Joiing the X5 xDrive40e and i8 sports coupé, the new 225xx, 330e and 740e will expand the German company’s petrol-electric range to five models. 
 
The 225xe Active Tourer uses i8 hybrid tech to provide either front-wheel, rear-wheel or all-wheel drive. It can run for 25 miles on electricity supplied by its 7.7kWh lithium-ion battery to an 88bhp motor. This supports a 1.5-litre, 134bhp 3-cylinder petrol engine driving the front wheels through a six-speed auto gearbox. With a combined power of 221bhp, its top speed is 126mph and its claimed 0-62mph time is 6.7sec. 
 
The rear-drive only 330xe uses a 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine and electric motor to deliver 248bhp and 310lb ft of torque. Like the 225xe, its electric-only range is 25 miles. The 330’s combined economy figure is 148.7mpg with 44g\/km of Cor emissions. 
 
On offer in both standard and long-wheelbase versions, the 740e has the option of four-wheel drive in the extended 740Le xDrive model. Again, as with the 330e, the hybrid system currently in the X5 xDrive40e is used. Its vital statistics are 321bhp, 369lb ft, 134.5mpg and 49g\/km. 
 
New BMW chairman Harald Krüger has promised more petrol-electric cars to come through 2. Every BMW car could be electric within ten years. BMW will plug-in to electric vehicles big time over the next ten years with every model in the range set to incorporate a plug-in hybrid powertrain by 2025.

Currently, the limit set by the EU only goes as far as 2012, however, it will certainly tighten heading towards 2025. One of the most effective passages to lowering CO2 output is introducing an electric powertrain, consisting of an electric motor on the front or both wheel axles, powered by a lithium-ion battery usually situated beneath the passengers. These batteries are typically large and heavy so one of BMW’s first obstacles will be reducing the actual weight of their vehicles to compensate for the extra load, as well as making the exterior shell more aerodynamic. BMW is one of the leading names in electric vehicles with its i3 hatchback and i8 hybrid supercar, winning huge acclaim by delivering impressive performance at a snippet of the running costs of their petrol and diesel-fuelled counterparts. Almost 18,000 i3s were sold worldwide throughout 2014. A plug-in variant of the X5 SUV will arrive in UK showrooms from Autumn. “For the smart people who want a gem of a city car and really want to embrace electric motoring, it’s easily the best choice on the market” -

The consumer watchdog is investigating whether Australian drivers have been misled by Volkswagen. 
           
 BMW has denied rigging the computers in its diesel cars to cheat emissions tests, after respected German motoring magazine AutoBild claims to have found its X3 model blew 11 times over the legal limit.  
   
AutoBild said road testing of the X3 diesel by the International Council on Clean Transportation — the same group whose tip-off led US regulators to investigate the VW cheating scandal — found it belched out “11.88 times the Euro 6 limit for NOx emissions”. 

BMW has strenuously denied the claim.

“The BMW Group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests,” a statement from the company says. 

“We observe the legal requirements in each country and adhere to all local testing requirements. 

“When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg test bench situation) or on the road.” 

BMW says the two studies carried out by the International Council on Clean Transportation have confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested did comply with the legal requirements concerning diesel emissions. 

“We are not familiar with the test mentioned by AutoBild concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 during a road test. No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results,” the BMW statement said.

 Originally published as Is BMW about to join VW diesel scandal?. BMW denies being emissions cheat too. BMW said on Thursday it did not cheat on emissions tests, responding to a report in German magazine Autobild that the X3 sports utility vehicle (SUV) exceeded the European limit for air pollution. 

The stock fell as much as 9.7%, the most in more than four years, on concerns that the car maker would be enmeshed in the diesel emissions scandal that led to the resignation of Volkswagen (VW) CEO Martin Winterkorn on Wednesday. 

A four-wheel-drive variant of the BMW SUV had emissions more than 11 times the European limit when road-tested by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the same group whose tip-off had led US regulators to investigate a gap between the emissions of VW and Audi diesel-powered cars in the testing lab and on the road, Autobild said. 

""The BMW Group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests,"" the company said. ""We observe the legal requirements in each country."" 

Meanwhile, a source close to the matter said VW would name Matthias Müller, the head of its Porsche brand, as its CEO. Mr Mueller will take responsibility for the biggest business crisis in VW’s 78-year history. 

Shares in the world’s largest car maker by sales have plunged as much as 40% since when US regulators said that it had admitted to cheating emissions tests on diesel cars. VW also faces a battle to restore the confidence of customers and motor dealers, who have expressed frustration at a lack of information from the company about how they will be affected by the scandal. 

Mr Müller had a majority on the supervisory panel, the source said. VW declined to comment. 

The board would also dismiss the head of the company’s US operations and top engineers at its Audi and Porsche brands, a senior source told Reuters. 

Mr Müller is a management board member of Porsche, and so is close to the Piech-Porsche family that controls VW through the holding company. He also spent many years at Audi. 

""He is a good choice even though he may be seen as a transitional CEO until another internal candidate such as VW brand CEO (Herbert) Diess has earned their stripes,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst, an analyst at Evercore ISI investment banking advisory firm. 

VW said on Tuesday about 11-million of its cars worldwide had been fitted with the software that was found to be cheating emissions in the US. The US Environmental Protection Agency has said VW could face penalties of up to $18bn. 

However, the crisis is still deepening. Germany’s transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said on Thursday that VW had manipulated tests in Europe as well as in the US. 

The company is under pressure to act decisively, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel urging it to quickly restore confidence.

©2015 PR Newswire. All Rights Reserved.. BMW shares plunge nearly 10% on report of excessive emissions. :06 

As the auto sector continued to reel from revelations that German giant Volkswagen was involved in a massive pollution cheating scandal, BMW shares tumbled 9.7 percent to an intraday low of 72.05 euros in late morning trade on a report in the weekly Auto Bild that emissions from one of its diesel models were 11 times higher than EU norms. 

© 2015 AFP. BMW Issues Statement on Diesel Emissions. After the VW\/Audi bombshell in which they admitted cheating on emissions tests, other manufacturers are trying to calm consumers’ fears about their diesel engines. For those who are not aware, VW engineers created software that only had certain emission controls active while they were being tested. Under normal driving conditions many systems were turned off thus improving performance and creating a more satisfying car to drive. I certainly enjoyed the performance of the Audi A3 TDI I drove this summer. Little did I know that my Audi “Clean Diesel” test car was anything but. 

The result of VW’s malfeasance is that their TDI engines put as much as 40 times more pollutants in the air than allowed. VW’s Chairman, Martin Winterkorn, has already resigned over this scandal and several other executives and managers are rumored to be ousted very soon. 

In a meeting I attended with Jaguar\/Land Rover executives on Tuesday, they went to great pains to assure me their new Ingenium Diesel engines meet all EPA and other global emissions standards. And today BMW released this statement after the German magazine Auto Bild published an article in which one of their car’s seemed to exceed emissions statndards. Auto Bild has since retracted their claim, but not before BMW’s stock fell 30% yesterday.

Policymakers worldwide, and in particular in the European Union, are setting tough standards for CO2 and other emissions. The 2020 targets in Europe can only be fulfilled through extensive use of modern diesel engines and further electrification. 

The progress achieved so far in CO2 reduction in Europe is largely due to the use of diesel technology. Meeting future requirements will not be feasible without diesel drive trains, since a diesel engine emits roughly 15 to 20 per cent less CO2 on average than a comparable petrol engine. 

At the BMW Group, we have invested a great deal in recent years in refining and optimizing diesel technology. 

At BMW, diesel vehicles accounted for 38% of vehicles sold worldwide last year: Europe 80%; Germany 73%; US 6%. This represents approx. 20,000 vehicles in the US in 2014. 

The Euro 6 emissions standard, which took effect on 1 September 2015 and is binding for all new vehicle registrations, improves both environmental and consumer protection. 

To bridge the gap between test results and real-life fuel consumption and emissions, the European Union is working on a new test cycle (WLTP) and an emissions test for real driving situations, known as “real driving emissions” or RDE. We support the swift introduction of the new regulations to create clarity for consumers and the industry as quickly as possible. 

At this point VW\/Porsche\/Audi are barred from selling diesel powered vehicles until fixes are made and verified. We are confident that BMW and other luxury manufacturers have not conspired to game the system. If you want the superior fuel economy and torque inherent in a diesel engine, you can buy one of theirs with a clear conscience. 

The post BMW Issues Statement on Diesel Emissions appeared first on Pursuitist .. Russian watchdog requests information from BMW unit on emissions. MOSCOW: Russian state standards agency Rosstandart said on Friday it had requested information from the Russian unit of German carmaker BMW related to possible issues with its exhaust emissions systems. 

""We have got information about possible problems with the exhaust control systems for BMW cars. In order to check this information ... a request has been sent to BMW Russland Trading to provide the necessary clarifications and materials on this issue,"" the watchdog said on its website. 

German trade magazine Auto Bild said on Thursday that some of BMW's diesel cars had been found to exceed permissible emissions levels, suggesting BMW may have manipulated some test results, a report the luxury carmaker denied.. Stocks are making a big comeback (SPY, DJI, IXIC, QQQ, CAT). It's another weak day on Wall Street. Near 2:50 p.m. Eastern Time, the Dow was down 55 points, the S&P 500 was down 17 points, and the NASDAQ was down 5 points. The three indexes were off their worst levels of the session. Google Finance
Caterpillar had some grim news Thursday morning. The industrial giant plans to lay off as many as 10,000 people because of what it calls ""a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors — namely in mining and energy."" This kind of language does not bode well coming from a bellwether for the economies of China and the rest of the world. Caterpillar's three-month rolling sales figures have been on the decline for 33 months. The company's stock opened down 7%, and its decline subtracted at least 30 points from the Dow in early trading. Google
We got some economic data Thursday morning. Initial jobless claims rose less than expected last week by 3,000 to 267,000. Durable goods orders fell 2%, while ""core"" durable goods orders fell 0.2% in August. And new-home sales jumped 5.7% at an annualized pace of 552,000 in August, the fastest in seven years. But the most anticipated event is Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's speech at 5 p.m. She will be speaking on inflation at the University of Massachusetts exactly a week after the Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged, citing sluggish inflation and global economic concerns. Meanwhile, the same theme that has recently plagued markets continues: uncertainty. ""Deferral of Fed lift-off to later this year or into Q1 leaves markets treading water,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note to clients Thursday. ""Heightened sensitivity to the ebb and flow of data is likely."" The vehicle-emissions scandal deepened overnight as we learned via a German media report that BMW's X3 xDrive 20d exceeded regulatory standards by 11 times. The company denied the report, and its stock fell by as much as 8%. This comes one day after Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned following his admission that the company cheated rules regarding diesel emissions. VW shares were all over the place in trading, rallying 8% before giving back all the gains. NOW WATCH: RED EVERYWHERE: It’s a global market meltdown. BMW shares plunge nearly 10% on report of excessive emissions. :06 

As the auto sector continued to reel from revelations that German giant Volkswagen was involved in a massive pollution cheating scandal, BMW shares tumbled 9.7 percent to an intraday low of 72.05 euros in late morning trade on a report in the weekly Auto Bild that emissions from one of its diesel models were 11 times higher than EU norms. 
 
© 2015 AFP. BMW drops on report X3 diesel’s emission exceeded EU limit. A BMW X3 xDrive20d is pictured during the media day ahead of the 84th Geneva Motor Show at the Palexpo Arena in Geneva, March 4, 2014. — Reuters pic FRANKFURT, Sept 24 — BMW AG fell as much as 9.3 per cent in Frankfurt after a German magazine reported that the X3 xDrive 20d sport utility vehicle emitted as much as 11 times the European limit for air pollution in a road test, adding to concern that the investigation weighing on Volkswagen AG may spread to other manufacturers. 
 
The SUV was road-tested by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the same group whose tipoff led US regulators to investigate a gap between Volkswagen AG diesels’ emissions in tests and on the road, Germany’s Autobild reported. BMW said that there’s no system in its cars that responds to tests differently than it would operate on the road. 
 
“There is no function to recognise emissions testing cycles at BMW,” the Munich-based company said in a statement in response to the report. “All emissions systems remain active outside the testing cycles.” 
 
BMW shares traded down 6.2 per cent to €74.9 (RM369) at 11:59am in Frankfurt. Shares of other German carmakers also declined. Daimler AG as much as 4.2 per cent, or €2.79, to €63.63. Volkswagen, which is at the heart of the probe and has lost about €20 billion in market value since Monday, recovered some of its losses, rising as much as 7.8 per cent. 
 
“There’s no suggestion BMW has done anything illegal,” said Juergen Pieper, an Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler. “However, there are concerns for the long-term damage on the business with diesel cars for every manufacturer that builds cars with these engines.” 
 
Car sales of the BMW namesake brand with diesel engines last year made up about 38 per cent of total deliveries, roughly in line with diesel car sales at other manufacturers, the company said. 
 
Emissions measured in road tests of 15 new diesel cars were an average of about seven times higher than European limits, according to a study ICCT published last October. — Bloomberg. 2016 BMW 740i & 750i xDrive Specifications & Gallery. Today BMW is dropping a boat load of photos and final specifications on the production version of the new G01 and G02 2016 7 Series. Given that there are so many variations of the new 7er we are breaking them out by petrol diesel and plugin hybrid models.

The post 2016 BMW 740i & 750i xDrive Specifications & Gallery appeared first on BimmerFile .. Stocks swoon: Nasdaq further into red for 2015. Stocks jumped Friday as Wall Street shook off a three-day slump after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said improving economic conditions should allow policymakers to begin raising interest rates this year.

Yellen suggested in a speech after markets closed Thursday that global economic weakness won't be significant enough to alter the central bank's plan to raise its key short-term rate from near zero by December. Uncertainty over the Fed's timetable for raising rates has been weighing on the market as investors seek clarity on monetary policy.

The Dow Jones industrial average was up about 230 points, or 1.4%, in afternoon trading, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 0.9%. The Nasdaq composite index was up but off its earlier highs, rising 0.1%.

In economic news, the latest revision of second-quarter gross domestic product showed that the economy grew at a faster pace than previously estimated. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the April-June quarter, up from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the Commerce Department said.

""A gradually increasing rate environment is a positive, because it sends a signal … that the U.S. is on a good, if not great, recovery to growth,"" said Scott Keifer, global investment specialist at JPMorgan private bank. He expects economic growth to average about 2.5% next year, allowing the Fed to raise interest rates gradually.

Shares of Nike (NKE) helped boost the Dow as the athletic gear reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. Nike was up 9% to $125.39 a share.

European markets rebounded Friday as scandal-plagued Volkswagen named Porsche CEO Matthias Mueller as its new CEO.

France's CAC 40 surged 3.1% and Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 2.5%. Germany's DAX index rose 2.8%, helped by a 4% rise in shares in BMW. The company saw a big drop Thursday on a report that one of its models exceeded European emissions limits. The report did not allege any cheating by BMW.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.8% to close at 17,880.51 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.4%. The Shanghai composite index lost 1.6%, closing at 3092.35.

Stocks climbed out of a deep dive Thursday, but still closed lower as the Nasdaq slid into negative territory for the calendar year and stocks posted their third straight down day.. Munich police fleets gets BMW i3 cars. The BMW i3 is now the sustainable and electrically-powered patrol car. For the first time, the BMW i3 comes as police emergency vehicle in Germany. Peter van Binsbergen, Head of Sales BMW Group Germany, handed the Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann three i3 police emergency vehicles. The i3 police cars feature the stripes blue design wrap which will be implemented on all Bavarians emergency vehicles in 2016. 
 
Installed on the BMW i3 is a special signaling system RTK 7 from Hella, horn speakers, and front and rear flashers. A digital equipment designed by Sepura was installed inside the i3. 
 

 
“The BMW i3 is the ideal support for the work of our police especially in the inner city area of ​​application. For many years we successfully work together with the BMW Group, to always optimally equip our officers. I am very pleased that we continue this cooperation also in the era of electric mobility and is now ready to begin the trial of electric vehicles as operational resources, ” said Minister of State Joachim Herrmann. 
 

 
“We are proud that the unique combination of sustainability, innovation and dynamism of the BMW i3 has the Bavarian police convinced,” says Peter van Binsbergen. “BMW emergency vehicles are optimally adapted with the latest technology and the highest quality to meet the needs of police officers. It is thus possible for the first time to use the i3 in new fields of application, with the zero-emission or silent drive needed to tap. Therefore, the BMW i3 represents the next step in sustainable mobility for emergency vehicles.”

The production of the BMW i3 emergency vehicles with specific special equipment for police operations is carried out in the BMW Group plant in Leipzig. 
 
Last week, BMW i and Los Angeles Police Department also announced a partnership which will provide BMW i3 electric vehicles to the police force in Southern California. 
              
The article Munich police fleets gets BMW i3 cars appeared first on BMW BLOG. BMW leads the way in PHEV models with expanded line-up. BMW has four new plug-in hybrid (PHEV) models on its stand at the Frankfurt Motor Show, confirming its position as one of the market leaders in electrified powertrains. 
 
The flagship eDrive model is the BMW 740e, which sees the large luxury saloon fitted with a petrol-electric system. The executive model uses a 2.0 litre, four cylinder twin turbocharged petrol engine alongside an electric motor to produce a combined 326hp, good for a 0-62mph time of 5.6 seconds. The economy figures are far more impressive though with the 740e returning an official combined 134.5 MPG and emitting 49 g\/km of CO2. 
 
To help make the most of the engine's power is an eight-speed automatic gearbox with an intuitive adaptive mode to maximise efficiency. A new, lighter chassis has also been developed with a large amount of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic used in the passenger cell, in a similar way to BMW's i8 sportscar. 
 
 
 
The X5 xDrive 40e will feature the same 2.0 litre twin-turbo petrol-electric motor set-up, this time producing 313hp. The X5 SUV will return more than 80 MPG and emissions figures come in at 77 g\/km CO2 - though, as with the 740e, there is the option to cover around 20 miles in electric-only mode with zero tailpipe emissions. 
 
 
 
Also using a 2.0 litre petrol engine combined with an electric motor is the 330e, BMW's 3 Series PHEV entry into the highly competitive small executive car market. Featuring 252hp, the 330e is quoted at returning 134.5 MPG and emitting 44 g\/km CO2. Again, the expected electric-only driving range is around 20 miles but, unlike the X5, the 330e is rear wheel drive only. 
 
 
 
Finally, the 2 Series Active Tourer gets the eDrive treatment with a smaller engine than in the other three new models. The 225xe uses a turbocharged 1.5 litre, three cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor to offer 224hp. In economy terms, the 225xe is officially able to return 134.5 MPG like the 330e and emissions come in at 46 g\/km CO2, though the expected electric range is around 25 miles. 
 
All models prioritise electric-only driving mode when the conditions allow and are due on sale between now and spring 2. BMW Drops Ridiculously Large Gallery Of 2016 7-Series [353 Photos]. By now, chances are you know everything about the all-new 2016 BMW 7-Series . However, there may be some parts of the car you haven’t seen yet, which is why the automaker has released a massive gallery comprising 353 photos. 

The photos were taken in Porto\/Lamego, Portugal, where the new 7-Series’ international media drive event took place and show the new luxury sedan from every possible angle. The sixth-generation of the BMW 7-Series is offered with two body variants with a standard and long wheelbase, both showcased in the gallery. 

The model is also offered with an M Sport package with gives the large sedan a sportier appearance, while the Pure Excellence and BMW Individual Design Composition packages emphasize the car’s luxurious side. 
  
Up to 130 kg (286 lbs) lighter than its predecessor thanks to the extensive use of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) in the passenger cell, the 2016 BMW 7-Series promises better driving characteristics thanks to new six-cylinder in-line petrol and diesel engines, an updated V8 engine and optional BMW xDrive all-wheel drive system. 
 
There’s also a new BMW 740e plug-in hybrid model with a total system output of 326PS and CO2 emissions of just 49 g\/km. 
 
All 2016 BMW 7-Series models are offered with a 2-axle automatic self-leveling air suspension and Dynamic Damper Control, while the optional Integral Active Steering is now also available in combination with BMW xDrive. 
 
Inside, the iDrive operating system gains a touch display to access numerous functions, but the new 7-Series also premieres the gesture control system. 
 
Other new features include the Remote Control Parking which uses the BMW Display Key and the Driving Assistant package which adds functions like Rear collision prevention, Lane Change Warning, Speed Limit Info and Rear crossing traffic warning.

http:\/\/www.carscoops.com. BMW hybrid cars launch date confirmed for 2016. Plug-in petrol-electric models of the 2, 3 and 7 Series BMWs will be available to British buyers in the first part of 2016 after being unveiled at this month’s Frankfurt Show. 
 
Joiing the X5 xDrive40e and i8 sports coupé, the new 225xx, 330e and 740e will expand the German company’s petrol-electric range to five models. 
 
The 225xe Active Tourer uses i8 hybrid tech to provide either front-wheel, rear-wheel or all-wheel drive. It can run for 25 miles on electricity supplied by its 7.7kWh lithium-ion battery to an 88bhp motor. This supports a 1.5-litre, 134bhp 3-cylinder petrol engine driving the front wheels through a six-speed auto gearbox. With a combined power of 221bhp, its top speed is 126mph and its claimed 0-62mph time is 6.7sec. 
 
The rear-drive only 330xe uses a 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine and electric motor to deliver 248bhp and 310lb ft of torque. Like the 225xe, its electric-only range is 25 miles. The 330’s combined economy figure is 148.7mpg with 44g\/km of Cor emissions. 
 
On offer in both standard and long-wheelbase versions, the 740e has the option of four-wheel drive in the extended 740Le xDrive model. Again, as with the 330e, the hybrid system currently in the X5 xDrive40e is used. Its vital statistics are 321bhp, 369lb ft, 134.5mpg and 49g\/km. 
 
New BMW chairman Harald Krüger has promised more petrol-electric cars to come through 2. BMW on Journey to Transform Signature M3 Sedan. Few cars have a more loyal following than the BMW M3. The high-performance version of the 3-Series sedan gives definition to the Bavarian maker's slogan, ""The Ultimate Driving Machine."" But what happens if BMW decides to redefine the M3? We'll find out later this decade when BMW will take the radical and risky step of switching from a conventional, twin-turbo V-6 to a new plug-in hybrid powertrain, a plan that senior company officials have confirmed. It will join an expanding array of battery-based products, including a plug-in version of BMW's new flagship, the 740e, set to launch next year. ""We have to go that way,"" said Ludwig Willisch, the CEO of BMW of North America. The BMW M4 coupe, right, and the M3 sedan are presented at a press preview at the North American International Auto Show on Jan. 13, 2014 in Detroit. STAN HONDA \/ AFP - Getty Images BMW is by no means alone. Mercedes-Benz has announced plans to have 10 plug-in hybrids, or PHEVs, in its line-up by 2017, along with pure battery-electric vehicles, standard hybrids and even a hydrogen car or two. Audi, Cadillac, even Bentley, also will be adding ""electrified"" models. advertisement There are several reasons why, explained Ian Robertson, a senior member of the BMW management board. Among them, tough new federal fuel economy and emissions standards that will be difficult to meet with even the most advanced conventional, gas-powered technology. Meanwhile, California, one of the world's largest markets for luxury vehicles, has set strict new standards that will require all makers to include so-called Zero-Emissions Vehicles, or ZEVs, to their fleets. China, in a number of cities including Beijing and Shanghai, has begun restricting new vehicle registrations, while giving qualifying battery vehicles an exemption. The 2016 Model A? Automakers Rescue Retired Brands from Scrap Heap And in Europe, a growing number of cities are considering outright bans on the gas engine or, like London, exempting zero-emissions vehicles from hefty tolls meant to discourage central city traffic congestion. advertisement Even a couple years ago, the idea of opting for battery power might have seemed absurd, Robertson said recently in an interview in New York where the latest 7-Series line was being introduced. Now, however, ""We believe hybrid technology is now advanced enough to be an attractive proposition,"" he said. Plug-in technology has evolved rapidly since General Motors put the first mainstream model, the Chevrolet Volt, into production six years ago. Sibling brand Cadillac, for example, will launch a PHEV version of its new CT6 flagship next year and Caddy officials promise it will match the performance of the twin turbo V-6 that will otherwise power the brand's new flagship sedan, the CT6. But a big sedan is not a compact performance car known for tearing up both street and track. Can a plug-in hybrid really meet the demands of an M3 buyer? advertisement For more than a century, said Robertson, ""the definition of performance was how big an engine and how many cylinders your car had."" No longer. BMW has already begun migrating to smaller, high-tech engines, such as the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 in the 750i. And with ""the next generation, with hybrid technology, the power-to-engine-size formula will not be relevant anymore."" In fact, proponents suggest that performance fans will be shocked by what a plug-in M3 can deliver. While the next model is still a work in progress, a senior member of the development team revealed that the target is to deliver about 75 extra pound-feet of tire-spinning torque out of the battery side of the new powertrain. And unlike a gas engine that needs to rev up, electric motors create maximum torque the moment they start to spin. Financially Speaking, Here Are the Best and Worst States for Driving Tesla provides a case in point. The P85d version of its Model S battery-electric sedan can launch from 0 to 60 in as little as 2.8 seconds. BMW promises the next M3 will not only be fast but will allow a driver to switch to electric mode and get an estimated 20 miles in battery mode alone. And unlike a pure electric vehicle like the Tesla, it will be able to switch back to gas power when the battery runs down. advertisement There remain technical challenges. For one thing, batteries are bulky, heavy and costly. But BMW's Robertson notes they're getting lighter, smaller - and less expensive. In 2010, a kilowatt-hour of lithium-ion batteries cost about $1,000, but by the launch of the next M3, BMW expects that will fall to somewhere between $200 and $300, said Robertson. Meanwhile, to offset the added mass, BMW is increasing the use of alternative materials, including high-strength steels and aluminum. The maker turned to carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, or CFRP, for the two battery-based vehicles sold by its new sub-brand, BMW i, and it is in a partnership setting up the world's largest carbon fiber production plant in Washington state. Will traditional buyers accept the new definition of the Ultimate Driving Machine? For BMW, the good news is that both the i3 and i8 battery models are generating positive reviews and solid sales even at a time when gasoline is cheap. The redefinition of BMW doesn't end with battery power. The carmaker also has been pushing to take a lead in the introduction of autonomous driving systems. The new 7-Series has an emergency crash avoidance system that will not only brake but steer around a potential collision if the driver doesn't act quickly enough. It will allow a motorist to take hands off the steering wheel for up to 15 seconds at a time on a well-marked freeway. And, in Europe, drivers will be able to exit the big sedan, tap a button on the new touchscreen key fob and the 7-Series will park itself in the garage. The Bavarian maker's increasing dependence upon technology is certain to shock some traditionalists, company officials concede, but they are betting that BMW can retain what Robertson calls its unique performance DNA no matter how high-tech its products become.

BMW stands for sheer driving pleasure – something that everyone enjoys in their own individual way. The 6 Series is a well-established favourite within BMW’s fleet of sleek and sporty vehicles - of course, some members of the series are sleeker and sportier than others but each offers the promise of quality performance and eye-catching style. But one thing is for certain: each of the 3 styles’ appearance captures the attention and they certainly captured our attention whilst driving them in Marseille and at the BMW test track last month. The bright minds at BMW have decided to revamp their entire 6 Series range at once and make available three new cars from the same family simultaneously. So there is plenty to admire and assess if you’re thinking about making a purchase in the category. But after spending an adrenaline fuelled day at BMW’s secret test track, here’s what we think...640d Convertible 
Perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing of the three new cars is the convertible, which BMW quite accurately describes as its “scene stealer”. With a broad range of colours to choose from and some of the latest Bang & Olufsen surround sound technology, there is plenty to be taken with. Luxurious. Sporty. Elegant. These are the values that make each BMW 6 Series model unmistakable and also unique in themselves. This convertible in Mediterranean Blue was equipped with a special leather called “Dakota” in Cinnamon Brown – it features sun reflective technology which came in very useful as we drove with the top down around the test track on a hot day. We felt free and satisfied driving with the breeze and sound of the roaring engine. The exterior which was actually inspired by sports boats is everything you might expect from a top class convertible with a TwinPower Turbo 6-cylinder diesel engine. The engine delivers significantly more dynamic power development and excellent responsiveness (which really impressed us), even at low engine speeds, while being exceptionally fuel efficient with low emissions.Connectivity at BMW’s 6 Series is superb: With access to information, concierge services, communication, traffic updates and apps including for example Spotify or Twitter (as bloggers, this came in useful in-between laps) where we could provide our social followers with pictures of the cars on the track. The Head-up display became once again pretty useful: It projects navigation and information directly onto the driver’s field of vision which is the stand out feature. MWS Craig comments: “I wondered if it would be distracting whilst driving laps but it is clever how you don’t notice it until you want to see it. I was very impressed with this.” Whilst on the test track this model was also very easy to control with great agility and airstream. A BMW instructor took us around the track with the top down which was certainly something which raised our blood pressure since he drives so fast. However, having the top down meant we could hear the engine for added effect. After this lap we used another stunning technology: the Parking Assistant which is great. MWS Craig comments: “I’d really like this in London. It’s a bit of technology in the car which basically makes parallel parking easier. It actually judges whether you’ll fit into a space whilst driving down a street.”650i xDrive Gran Coupé 
The Gran Coupé is powered by a set of TwinPower turbo engines. This Space Grey model had the M Sport Package and was incredibly well-equipped with all the latest driving support and energy management technologies – perfect for test track driving. BMW calls the Gran Coupé its “performance artist” and it is easy to see why, with the 6 Series delivering a very complete driving experience and a hugely appealing combination of speed, sophistication and comfort. Whilst on the BMW track the M leather multifunction steering wheel came in handy. It features extra grip when turning to give the finest driving corrections aiding that all important racing line. We were truly amazed at how quick and nippy this car was for its size. Due to the vehicles xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive system, keeping control of it on the track was surprisingly easy, even for the most novice of drivers like us. Craig comments “It was the biggest of the three cars so I was a little nervous but that soon turned to confidence. I liked the Green Stripe Climate Control Windscreen which helps keep the car at a comfortable temperature by reducing the effects of direct sunlight. It also had those amazing cooling seats to keep me cool under the pressure when driving on the narrow test track section.”The main luxury of this model is certainly the spaciousness. We actually gave it the name ‘The Presidential car’, and the engine sound can certainly make the hairs stand up. The size also means that the surround view feature which gives you top, side and rear view camera angles was particularly useful. During our track experience, we were given guidance and track driving tips from the instructor – and he absolutely loves driving at speed. What we really like about this vehicle? MWS Craig comments: “Well, the 6 Series for us is an elegant car with attractive lines and a modern style. Inside you discover comfortable seats and a high tech interior - you clearly have the feeling of a luxury, soothing and seductive car. The driving is fabulous and the powertrain is powerful – the vehicle is very efficient and easy to use too. The chassis keep the car low to the road and the steering is incredibly precise. You can appreciate the driving pleasure with very rigorous road feedback which gives you confidence in the 6 Series.” 650i Coupé 
Completing the set is the Citrin Black Coupé which is every bit as elegant and striking as any of its predecessors or indeed its counterparts. We felt that this is truly the trophy car that we’d like to own and suited the test track perfectly – It’s another sporty machine that more than meets any expectations that a potential buyer might have if they’re looking for a vehicle to blend poise and power. Craig mentions that when he first sat inside “I fell for it, the interior leathers and how the paintwork shimmers in the sunlight. True beauty!” This is the most exclusive way to drive a BMW - A joy to drive and fitted with a vast array of technological elements designed to improve both comfort and performance, the 6 Series Coupé genuinely leads the way in its class and among the latest of BMW’s newest offerings. We liked how this car was equipped with the ‘Character Package: Design Pure Experience’, “firstly the finish looked great in the sun, but the package gave focus to the athletic car body with high-gloss finishes,” said Craig. This model gave us the most thrilling of driving experiences whilst on the BMW track. This is due to the cars Driving Dynamics such as road holding, high-precision steering and immediate responsiveness. Craig comments: “At first I wasn’t adjusted to the power and ran off one of the early corners but after some very insightful driving tips and a couple of laps with the instructor I had confidence to push the speed up and gained a thumbs up from my expert tutor. I also really liked the Launch Control feature which enables maximum acceleration from standing to start. After all, no one wants to embarrass themselves when trying to look like a good driver.”Conclusion 
If you prefer more roominess than what an average car has to offer then the Gran Coupé will be the better option for you. However, for all out enjoyment and the sheer satisfaction of a dynamic driving experience then the Coupé option is tough to beat, not just in this range, but anywhere on the road. The Convertible – of course – is the perfect choice for a sunny road trip and driving pleasure. If you are a long-term BMW driver then you are sure to be impressed with the latest developments being made in relation to all aspects of the new 6 Series.

The plug-in hybrid drive has an overall system output of 165 kW\/224 hp. Average fuel consumption (combined) in the BMW 225xe is a frugal 2.1–2.0 litres\/100 km (134.5–141.2 mpg imp), which equates to CO2 emissions (combined) of 49–46 g\/km (in the EU test cycle). 

BMW EfficientDynamics: BMW eDrive technology paves the way for electric driving pleasure in four plug-in hybrid models from BMW. 

The introduction of BMW eDrive technology in BMW brand models opens up all-electric motoring with zero local emissions to new target groups. Coinciding with the world premiere of the new BMW 7 Series, the plug-in hybrid variant of the luxury sedan, the BMW 740e, is also being unveiled. The BMW 330e with plug-in hybrid drive is being added to the model line-up for the new BMW 3 Series. And it will also be possible to sample the pleasure of all-electric driving with zero local emissions in the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer in future – with the BMW 225xe. This means that, together with the soon-to-be-launched BMW X5 xDrive40e also on display at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, the BMW eDrive technology initially developed for BMW i cars will already be available for BMW models spanning four different vehicle segments in 2016. 

New performance athlete for endurance racing: the BMW M6 GT3. 

BMW Motorsport has chosen the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show as the setting for the world premiere of the new flagship model in the BMW customer racing range: the BMW M6 GT3 has been built for endurance racing and will make its debut on the starting grid in the 2016 season. The racing car designed on the basis of the BMW M6 Coupe is powered by a V8 engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology that has only undergone minor modifications for competition and comes with an aerodynamically optimised chassis. Crash structures and an outer skin made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) help to keep the overall vehicle weight below 1,300 kilograms.

BMW issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. WFMY 7:01 p.m. EDT September 24, 2015

A sudden wave of scrutiny over emissions threatened to engulf BMW after a German magazine reported Thursday that one of the luxury automaker's diesel vehicles emitted 11 times the amount of nitrogen oxides acceptable in Europe. 

The German automaker's shares tumbled about 5% Thursday following Auto Bild magazine's report that the International Council on Clean Transportation had discovered curiously high emissions on the BMW X3 crossover vehicle. 

BMW issued a forceful statement denying any wrongdoing, saying in an email to USA TODAY that it ""does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests."" 

""We observe the legal requirements in each country and adhere to all local testing requirements,"" BMW said. ""When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg. test bench situation) or on the road."" 

The news comes after an ICCT investigation conducted in cooperation with West Virginia University researchers uncovered irregularities in the emissions performance of Volkswagen diesel cars . 

That prompted a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation that caused Volkswagen to admit it had rigged 11 million cars worldwide with cheating software , a scandal that has crushed the German automaker's stock, severely damaged the VW brand and triggered costs of more than $7 billion. 

To be sure, while Volkswagen intentionally misled regulators by installing the so-called ""defeat device"" on diesel vehicles, it's far from clear whether BMW or other automakers have used similarly deceptive software. 

BMW said it is ""not familiar with the test mentioned by Auto Bild"" but will ask ICCT ""for clarification of the test they carried out."" 

ICCT research has previously suggested that excessive nitrogen oxide emissions — which can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma — may not be exclusive to Volkswagen. 

In a report earlier this month , ICCT said that on-road testing of 32 European diesel cars from 10 automakers found that the average vehicle was generating nitrogen oxide emissions at twice the regulatory limit. 

Some ""manufacturers seem to be focusing on meeting emission limits over the current test cycle while neglecting real-world operating conditions,""ICCT study co-author Vicente Franco said in a statement.

Official Release: The innovative BMW eDrive technology in the new BMW 225xe and new BMW 2016 330e once again underlines BMW’s leading role in the premium segment when it comes to powertrain electrification. BMW eDrive technology includes a number of cutting-edge plug-in hybrid components and makes a significant contribution to reducing fuel consumption and emissions. BMW eDrive is one of the most cutting-edge elements of the groundbreaking BMW EfficientDynamics suite of technology. 
 

 
Locally emission-free driving. 
 
BMW eDrive is the new drive system technology used in all the electrically powered vehicles from BMW i and the plug-in hybrid models from BMW. As well as outstanding efficiency and seamless everyday practicality, BMW eDrive also delivers the highest standards in driving dynamics and quality, in keeping with BMW tradition. Alongside BMW TwinPower Turbo technology for combustion engines, intelligent lightweight design and optimised aerodynamics, BMW eDrive technology is therefore one of the most important elements in the EfficientDynamics strategy designed to increase power and further reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. In addition, BMW eDrive offers the option of driving on electric power alone and therefore with zero local emissions – yet at the same time reveals the ability to cover long distances when the two drive systems team up. 
 
Moreover, BMW eDrive technology ensures extremely dynamic acceleration off the line thanks to the instantaneous responses of the electric motor, which generates its remarkable torque from the word go. Plus, the eBoost function, which pools the torque of both drive systems under acceleration, serves up BMW’s signature driving pleasure, whatever the conditions. 
 

 
Designed for different vehicle concepts. 
 
The most important components of BMW eDrive technology are the synchronous electric motor (including the power electronics developed by BMW), the lithium-ion high-voltage battery and intelligent energy management. The latter ensures the electric motor and combustion engine in plug-in hybrid models work together as effectively as possible according to the situation at hand.
Developed initially for the all-electric BMW i3 and BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car – which duly led the way in electric mobility in the premium sector – the modular structure of BMW eDrive technology sets it up perfectly for use in various vehicle concepts and segments. BMW uses its plentiful technical experience and customer feedback in the development of the latest BMW eDrive models. The fine-tuning of vehicle-specific elements, such as the battery cells, cooling management, power electronics and operating strategy, has involved the transfer of knowledge from the BMW i3 and BMW i8 to the development of new BMW eDrive models. Here, all components are adapted precisely to the vehicle at hand and optimised in terms of performance, efficiency, safety and durability. Moreover, BMW eDrive technology enables the electrified xDrive concept first featured in the BMW i8 to be executed with great efficiency. 
 

 
BMW eDrive: familiar BMW character, flexible usage options. 
 
BMW eDrive technology essentially spans the electric motor, the lithium-ion high-voltage battery and the power electronics. Based on a shared eBoost strategy, all BMW plug-in hybrid models offer supreme power delivery by bringing together their two drive systems, and elevate the responsiveness of BMW TwinPower Turbo technology to another new level. BMW eDrive makes all-electric driving in urban areas and over cross-country routes a marketable proposition. An important element of the operating strategy is the need-oriented use of externally sourced and recuperated electric energy to maximise the vehicle’s efficiency. The components of the BMW eDrive architecture are tailored to each particular vehicle concept and can be combined with four- and three-cylinder petrol engines as well as with classical rear-wheel drive, BMW xDrive or electrified all-wheel drive. 
 
The eDrive components developed as part of the BMW i projects will soon be integrated into other model ranges from the core brands. This scalable architecture also provides the platform required to offer plug-in hybrid vehicles at attractive prices on a par with those of conventionally powered variants of similar output. This means customers who opt for this advanced drive concept encounter not only the environmental benefits of electric mobility, but also economic plus-points. 
 

 
Plug-in hybrid: energy management at its most intelligent. 
 
In plug-in hybrid vehicles, intelligent energy management ensures the combustion engine and electric motor work together to maximum effect in all driving situations. Their operating strategy is based on the vehicle starting up on electric power only. BMW’s plug-in hybrid vehicles prioritise electric mode at low and moderate speeds, which allows them to exploit the benefits of the locally emission-free electric drive system. Under greater acceleration and at higher speeds, however, the combustion engine also joins the action. The boost function pools the torque of both drive systems to maximise the car’s dynamic performance and lend it remarkable poise and assurance. BMW eDrive ensures that the combustion engine runs efficiently (electric assist) at higher speeds as well. This allows a reduction in fuel consumption on brisk cross-country or motorway runs, for example. And when the route guidance function of the car’s navigation system is activated, the proactive function initiates an anticipatory operating strategy which optimises efficiency and maximises the electric driving experience. 
 
Like the BMW i8, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, BMW 330e and BMW 740e can all – at the touch of a button in MAX eDRIVE mode – run on purely electric power up to 120 km\/h (75 mph), the BMW 225xe up to 125 km\/h (78 mph). Here, the combustion engine only comes into play when the accelerator’s kickdown threshold is passed. In SAVE BATTERY mode the battery’s charge can be maintained to enable electric driving later on in the journey. If the charge level drops below 50 per cent, the battery is replenished. If the selector lever is moved into the S gate, the combustion engine starts up regardless of the mode engaged, ensuring sustained availability of the combined maximum output of the two drive systems. In addition, the battery’s charge is raised to 80 per cent. 
 
With the addition of the BMW eDrive functions, the ECO PRO, COMFORT and SPORT driving experience modes are now even more clearly defined than on conventional vehicles. 
 

 
Fast and convenient battery charging. 
 
The high-voltage batteries of the new BMW plug-in hybrid models can be charged extremely easily, conveniently and quickly – both at home and while on the move – using BMW 360° ELECTRIC solutions. The battery can be powered up again from a domestic socket using the standard charging cable supplied or from a BMW i Wallbox (charging power: 3.7 kW). When it comes to topping up the battery during a journey, the BMW i mobility service, ChargeNow, gives customers access to the world’s largest public charging network of over 30,000 charging points run by partners in 22 countries. 
 

 
Higher performance, lower fuel consumption. 
 
The new BMW plug-in hybrid models with eDrive technology – such as the new BMW X5 xDrive40e, the BMW 225xe and BMW 330e currently making their debuts, and the BMW 740e due for launch in the near future – are once again setting the benchmark in the various corners of the premium segment when it comes to reducing fuel consumption, and will also meet the stipulations of international legislation in the future regarding CO2 emissions. Moreover, their all-electric and therefore locally emission-free driving mode will also allow them to drive into city centre zones where entry is regulated. And yet the BMW plug-in hybrid models also deliver the hallmark BMW attributes of dynamic excellence, sporting ability and driving pleasure while offering the best performance in their respective segments. 
                                                                                                                         
The post BMW Debuts The 2016 330e and 225xe Plugin Hybrids (w\/Gallery) appeared first on BimmerFile .. U.S. Stocks Fall For Third Session. U.S. stocks extended their selloff into a third straight session Thursday, dragged down by declines among big industrial firms and auto makers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 195 points, or 1.2%, to 16085 in early afternoon trade.

Shares of Caterpillar Inc. posted the biggest decline in the Dow after the maker of heavy equipment cut its revenue outlook and announced up to 10,000 job cuts as part of a cost-cutting plan. Shares fell 6.3%, knocking 28 points off the index.

The S&P 500 lost 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2%.

Investors sought shelter in assets perceived as safe, including U.S. government debt. Rising prices sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to its lowest level in nearly a month, recently falling to 2.098%.

""When a bellwether like Caterpillar says something like that, it's going to take its toll on the sector for sure,"" said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird. ""There's a flight to things that aren't stocks.""

Industrial companies in the S&P 500 fell 1.4%.

The declines in the U.S. followed steep falls in Europe, where the scandal enveloping Volkswagen AG hit autos shares again. The Stoxx Europe 600 shed 2.1%. Germany's DAX declined 1.9% and France's CAC 40 fell 1.9%.

BMW AG shares fell 5.2% in Frankfurt after a magazine reported that emissions of a model of the German car maker were higher than allowed under standardized testing conditions. BMW said it hasn't manipulated test results.

Shares of U.S. auto makers also lost ground. General Motors Co. fell 1.6%, while Ford Motor Co. declined 1.3%.

U.S. stocks have yet to bounce back meaningfully from a steep selloff that began in late August. Last week's announcement that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep interest rates near zero has failed to give shares a lift. The Dow is up 2.7% from its Aug. 25 low, but remains down 12% from its most recent record of 18312 reached in May.

The Federal Reserve's decision last week to keep short-term interest rates near zero has failed to give stocks much of a lift. Many investors say the central bank's decision to stand pat instead affirmed worries that global growth was slowing.

Investors remained cautious ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen later in the day at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, which could offer clues on the timing of a rise in rates.

In economic news, initial jobless claims rose by 3,000 to 267,000 in the week ended Sept. 19, the Labor Department said Thursday, a level consistent with an improving labor market. Economists had expected 275,000 new claims.

Orders for big-ticket items fell in August, a sign that the strong dollar and economic weakness overseas may be crimping demand for American goods. New orders for durable goods fell 2% in August from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists had expected orders to fall 2.5%.

""Investors' confidence is fragile. Markets are uncertain post the Fed decision,"" said James Barty, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

In commodities, crude oil in New York rebounded from early losses, rising 0.7% to $44.76 a barrel. Gold futures gained 1.8% to $1,152.10 a troy ounce.

Shares in Japan fell sharply as trading resumed after a three-day holiday. The Nikkei Stock Average closed down 2.8% , catching up with declines in global markets over recent sessions. China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.9% higher.

The euro rose 0.5% against the dollar to trade around $1.1240, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Wednesday the central bank is ready to expand its quantitative easing program, but that there is no urgency to do so.

SOURCE  Greenlots. BMW X3 Diesel Also Emits More Than Legal Limit. “Specifically, we do not have “defeat devices” in vehicles we engineer and manufacture”. 
 

 
 
 
On Monday, German carmaker Volkswagen admitted it had been using software in 11 million diesel cars worldwide aimed at deceiving regulators measuring toxic emissions. 
 
Authorities in Europe are calling for wider investigations, even though the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said “there is no evidence that this is an industry-wide issue”. Hackenberg was previously responsible for VW brand development and Hatz ran the nameplate’s motor development. 
 
Peugeot: “We do not comment on the VW case”. Competing ratings service Fitch said Thursday it as was also weighing a cut. 
 
BMW has been brought into the vehicle emissions scandal that has resulted in Volkswagen losing £18 billion of its value. 
 
Auto Bild , a German-based automotive publication, said Thursday in a pre-release of an article to be published later this week that BMW’s X3 xDrive 20d sports utility vehicle, powered by a diesel engine, emitted more than 11 times more nitrogen oxide than permitted by the European Union under standardized conditions. 
 
ICCT also found a gap between real-world and lab performance in BMW’s X3, Germany’s Autobild magazine reported. 
 
A spokesperson for BMW said: “There is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on (test) rollers or on the road”. 
 
A statement issued after the report said: “The BMW group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests. As far as we are concerned, PSA Peugeot Citroën complies with the existing homologation procedures in all countries where the Group operates”. An analyst in Frankfurt told Bloomberg that there is nothing to suggest that BMW did anything wrong, but there is new concern about the damage that could be done to sales of all diesel cars from any automaker. 
 
The ICCT released a white paper earlier this month on nitrogen oxide control technologies used in European diesel passenger cars. 
 
Volkswagen’s supervisory board is due to meet Friday to discuss a successor to former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down Wednesday. It is also expected to name the executives responsible for the scandal, with media reports that directors from Porsche, Audi and the company’s USA division are set to leave. 
 

 
The logo of German luxury car maker BMW-Mini. BMW shares plunge on report it broke pollution limit. (CNNMoney) -  
Another German automaker was dragged into the scandal over harmful emissions from diesel engines Thursday -- at least on the stock market. 
 
Shares in BMW slumped 8% to their lowest level in two years after a German magazine reported that at least one model had breached European pollution limits by a huge margin in road tests. 

Auto Bild said the BMW X3 xDrive 20d had produced 11 times as much nitrogen oxide as permitted in independent road tests conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation. 

The scandal erupted Friday when U.S. regulators revealed Volkswagen had cheated pollution tests on 500,000 vehicles by programming them to produce fewer emissions than they do in normal driving conditions. 

Since then, the world's biggest carmaker has admitted there could be problems with emissions in 11 million vehicles worldwide. Its shares have been slammed, CEO Martin Winterkorn has resigned, and prosecutors in the U.S. and Germany are considering legal action. 

The action by federal and California state regulators against Volkswagen had its origin in research conducted by the ICCT into emissions from three vehicles: a VW Jetta, a VW Passat, and a BMW X5. 

The Jetta and Passat cars produced way more nitrogen oxide than permitted. The BMW X5 was ""generally at or below the standard, and only exceeded it during rural uphill operating conditions,"" according to the ICCT. 

Auto Bild appears to be referring to a separate set of tests. 

""All the results indicate that this problem is not specific to VW,"" Auto Bild quoted ICCT expert Peter Mock as saying. 

BMW said it was not familiar with the BMW X3 road test mentioned in the article. 

""No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results. We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the test they carried out,"" it said in a statement. 

The company also repeated that it does not manipulate or rig any tests on its cars. 

""When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg. test bench situation) or on the road,"" BMW said. 

It's a measure of how nervous investors are about the potential fallout for European automakers that the stock was so hard hit in early dealing. It has lost about 40% since March. 

""Shares in BMW are weak again today on speculation that its diesel emissions test results may also have been doctored to appear eco-friendly and thus saleable in the world's second largest but arguably the most important car market, the U.S.,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.. BMW X1 walks tall into the SUV market. HIGH, wide and handsome is the promise being made to company car user-choosers by the new taller BMW X1 compact SUV. 
 
It’s grown upwards by a full 53mm to give a more commanding presence in the corporate car park and offer more internal loading space. 
  X1 highlights   Roof height raised by 53mm to boost space and presence;  Near 50:50 weight distribution;  Efficient petrol 2.0-litre claims 44.8mpg and 146g\/km CO2 emissions;  Most frugal diesel BMW X1 sDrive18d boasts 68.9mpg and 109g\/km CO2 emissions;  On sale in UK from end of October.    
Despite the higher roofline, the car’s centre of gravity has been lowered and it enjoys a virtually perfect 50:50 weight distribution, a wide track, short overhangs and claims optimised weight and the impressive rigidity of the body and chassis. 
 
For the BIK conscious business driver, the X1 will be available with one petrol and three diesel units, each of 2.0-litres with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology. 
 
The petrol X1 xDrive20i will enjoy 192hp and a peak torque of 280Nm which comes in from just 1,250rpm and features, as standard, an eight-speed Steptronic transmission. 
 
It claims acceleration from 0 to 62mph in 7.4 seconds, with an average fuel consumption is 44.8mpg and CO2 emissions come in at 146g\/km. 
 
Diesel versions include the new BMW X1 xDrive25d, multi-stage turbocharging with 231hp, making it the most powerful four-cylinder diesel ever fitted in a BMW bolstered by a peak torque of 450Nm. 
 
With the standard-fit eight-speed Steptronic transmission it will sprint from 0 to 62mph in 6.6 seconds and claims an average fuel consumption of 56.5mpg and CO2 emissions of 132g\/km. 
 
For even cheaper tax rates there’s the X1 xDrive20d and BMW X1 sDrive18d which boast 190hp and 150hp respectively resulting in 0 to 62mph sprint in 7.6 seconds and 9.2seconds. The X1 xDrive20d claims 57.6mpg and 128g\/km, while the X1 sDrive18d boasts 68.9mpg and 109g\/km. 
 
On the inside, the iDrive operating system’s Control Display comes in the form of a 6.5-inch or, optionally, 8.8-inch freestanding monitor. Navigation is standard on the new X1, as it is on all BMWs from September onwards, and the rear seat bench comes as standard with a three-section split\/folding backrest and is available as an option with the ability to slide forwards and backwards by 13cm. 
 
Standard specification in the UK for the new BMW X1 includes cloth seat surfaces in the colour combination Anthracite\/Black, and interior trim strips in Oxide, Silver dark matt with accent strips in high-gloss black. Dakota leather trim in Black or Canberra Beige are options. 
 
The new BMW X1 uses completely new front\/transverse-mounted four-cylinder engines and a newly developed BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system or an advanced front-wheel-drive configuration, depending on the model. 
 
The DSC stability system includes features such as the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), Cornering Brake Control (CBC), Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), Brake Assist system, Fading Compensation, a Dry Braking function and a Start-Off Assistant. 
 
Other technology available to customers includes the trailer stabilisation function, Active Differential Brake (ADB) function and Performance Control. When DSC is deactivated, an electronic locking function for the front axle differential – known as Electronic Differential Lock Control (EDLC) – comes into play. 
 
Internet connectivity comes from BMW ConnectedDrive with a navigation option that assists route guidance on the standard-fitted Control Display with direction arrows and sophisticated map graphics, including views from various angles. A further option is BMW’s Navigation Plus system, which comprises a bigger – now 8.8-inch – Control Display, an instrument cluster with extended features, a split-screen function for the Control Display as well as the BMW Head-Up Display. 
 
The camera-based assistance systems available include the Driving Assistant with Lane Departure Warning, Speed Limit Info with No Passing Info display, the BMW Selective Beam anti-dazzle High Beam Assistant, as well as Collision Warning and Pedestrian Warning with City Braking function. 
 
In addition to these functions, the Driving Assistant Plus line- up also features the Active Cruise Control system with Stop & Go function – which maintains both a desired speed between 19–87mph as entered by the driver and the safety distance to vehicles travelling ahead – and the Traffic Jam Assistant. 
 
Park Distance Control and the rear-view camera, plus Parking Assistant are also available. 
 
BMW UK expects to sell 8,000 BMW X1s in its first full year of sales. The BMW X1 goes on sale 24 October, 2015, priced from £26,780 for two-wheel drive, from £29,830 all-wheel drive. 
 
The post appeared first on Business Car Manager .. Some BMW diesel cars exceed EU pollution limits by 11 times: Report. BERLIN: Some diesel cars of high-end automaker BMW produce dangerous gases that exceed EU anti-pollution limits by up to 11 times, German weekly Auto Bild reported Thursday. 

The claim came as Germany's powerful car industry was reeling over revelations that auto giant Volkswagen had installed software in up to 11 million cars that could cheat pollution tests. 

""Volkswagen is not the only carmaker whose cars produce high levels of nitrogen oxide,"" said the magazine, accusing certain vehicles of the BMW group of the same. 

It quoted road tests carried out by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) which found that BMW's X3 xDrive equipped with 20d diesel motors produce gas emissions that are 11 times higher than European limits. 

""All these data show that the problem is not specific to VW,"" Peter Mock from ICCT was quoted as saying. 

The ICCT had been at the origin of the stunning revelations of cheating by Volkswagen, which went public last Friday when the United States announced a probe. 

Amid investor jitters over the widening VW scandal, the report immediately sent BMW shares down by almost 10 percent, to an intraday low of 72.05 euros in late morning trade.. BMW caught cheating with nitric oxide levels, shares down by 8% [UPDATED]. BMW caught cheating with nitric oxide levels, shares down by 8% 2014 BMW X3 facelift X3 records more than eleven times higher nitric oxide levels [update]: AutoBild revised it's article, saying there's no real evidence BMW is using a device to cheat the emission tests. A spokesman of the Bavarian company told the magazine “there is no function to recognize emissions testing cycles at BMW"" and ""all emissions systems remain active outside the testing cycles”.
Hot on the heels of Volkswagen’s huge diesel scandal, BMWcould also get into trouble as it seems they were also cheating on emissionstests.
AutoBild reports the X3 xDrive 20d has failed during a streettest performed by the International Council on Clean Transportation, showingmore than eleven times higher emissions of nitric oxide than permitted by theEuropean Union.
The information is still not confirmed by the Bavarianmanufacturer, but the shares of the company have already fallen with more than8% since Thursday morning.
Full details about the research are expected tomorrow withthe next issue of the AutoBild magazine. Source: AutoBild and WSJ

Can Electric Cars Shed Their Elite Reputation?. Tesla Model X 
  
On June 25, the California Air Resources Board approved changes to plug-in car incentives to limit rebates for high-income consumers, and increase rebates for low- to moderate-income buyers. Those changes will take effect in the coming months, just as a wave of luxury EVs and plug-in hybrids come to market—most noticeably the Tesla Model X all-electric SUV. 
 
The Model X is one of the most anticipated electric vehicles of the past couple years. The type of doors used in the Model X—so-called falcon doors that rise up and above the vehicle—are usually reserved for the most expensive supercars. 
 
CARB’s decision in June set a cap at $250,000 per year for an individual, and $500,000 per year in annual household income. The Golden State offers a $2,500 rebate on top of the $7,500 tax credit granted by the federal government for battery-only EVs, and an additional $1,000 for plug-in hybrids. (For more information on plug-in vehicle incentives in your state, check out our Incentives page .) 
 
Buyers with incomes less than 300 percent of the Federal Poverty Limit will get up to $3,000 for a plug-in hybrid, and $4,000 for an electric car. 
 
Critics of government support for electric vehicles sometimes characterize them as “high-priced toys for the rich.” While most high-earners would still be eligible to receive the subsidy, CARB chair Mary Nichols told the Los Angeles Times in late August that the cap is being set to apply only to “super-rich” EV buyers. “Our policy objective here is to rapidly increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles in the state,” she said. 
 
So far, the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project has provided $242 million in reduced EV costs to nearly 115,000 buyers. According to the Center for Sustainable Energy, only about six percent of households receiving the subsidy earn more than $500,000 per year. An additional 34 percent of EV buyers who were granted the tax earn $200,000 or more, while 77 percent earning more than $100,000 per year. 
 Who Benefits?  
While those numbers may give the impression that the credits will still find their way mostly into the pockets of the wealthy, the primary beneficiaries of the subsidies have always been the automakers, who are required by CARB mandates to sell a minimum number of electrics and plug-in hybrids—or face fines. Without the subsidies, CARB officials believe carmakers would have a more difficult time finding buyers. In other words, the credits are primarily targeted at making the EV market viable while automakers find ways to cut production costs, and thereby reduce purchase prices. 
 
At face value, CARB’s rule change seems targeted at makers of relatively expensive EVs, such as Tesla, BMW and Mercedes. But the effect of the incentives on these buyers, and the broad market, is not entirely understood.  The Tesla Model S, and upcoming Model X, commonly sell for around $100,000. Models from BMW, Audi and Mercedes—while not as highly priced as Tesla vehicles—are certainly in the luxury category, tens of thousands of dollars higher than the most affordable EVs on the market. 
 
The federal tax credit remains open to all.  The State of Washington is also considering limits to EV incentives, but instead is targeting the purchase price of the vehicle—by disallowing cars that cost more than $35,000. 
 
California hopes that the cap will have the effect of quieting critics of CARB’s rabate, without significantly discouraging EV adoption. Several other incentives like single-occupancy access to carpool lanes and local parking perks in some towns and cities, would still benefit all buyers, regardless of income. 
 
Last year, state Sen. Kevin de León, of Los Angeles, now the state Senate leader, had legislation signed into law by the governor that directs the state to put 1 million low- and zero-emission vehicles on California roads by 2023. 
 
Of course, the other beneficiaries of the California tax credits are those who breathe air—namely, everybody. Pure electric cars—regardless of their price tags—have no tailpipes, and therefore emit no pollution.. BMW Group statement concerning the current discussion of diesel engines - updated Friday, September 25, 2015.. WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J. , Sept. 25, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- BMW Group is committed to observing the legal requirements in each country and fulfilling all local testing requirements. 

In other words, our exhaust treatment systems are active whether rolling on the test bench or driving on the road. 
   
Clear, binding specifications and processes are in place through all phases of development at the BMW Group in order to avoid wrongdoing. 

Two studies carried out by the ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation) have confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested comply with the legal requirements concerning NOx emissions. No discrepancies were found in the X5 between laboratory-test and field-test NOx emissions. 

The German magazine Auto Bild has published a clarification of their article released yesterday ( September 24 ) concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 stating: ""No evidence of emission manipulation by BMW…. The values mentioned in the document were only generated in a single, one hour-long road test. Auto BILD has no access to the details of this test trail, which might explain the discrepancies to the test cycle NEDC.""  (NEDC stands for New European Driving Cycle) 

BMW Group is willing to discuss our testing procedures with the relevant authorities and to make our vehicles available for testing at any time. 

The importance of diesel engines in achieving CO2 targets 

Policymakers worldwide, and in particular in the European Union, are setting tough standards for CO2 and other emissions. The 2020 targets in Europe can only be fulfilled through extensive use of modern diesel engines and further electrification. 

The progress achieved so far in CO2 reduction in Europe is largely due to the use of diesel technology. Meeting future requirements will not be feasible without diesel drive trains, since a diesel engine emits roughly 15 to 20 per cent less CO2 on average than a comparable petrol engine.  

At the BMW Group, we have invested a great deal in recent years in refining and optimizing diesel technology. 

At BMW, diesel vehicles accounted for 38% of vehicles sold worldwide last year: Europe 80%; Germany 73%; US 6%. This represents approx. 20,000 vehicles in the US in 2014. 

The Euro 6 emissions standard, which took effect on 1 September 2015 and is binding for all new vehicle registrations, improves both environmental and consumer protection. 

To bridge the gap between test results and real-life fuel consumption and emissions, the European Union is working on a new test cycle (WLTP) and an emissions test for real driving situations, known as ""real driving emissions"" or RDE. We support the swift introduction of the new regulations to create clarity for consumers and the industry as quickly as possible.

Stars: 3.5 

It's a quirk of modern life that for so long we can live without something, but as soon as a new invention comes along to fill a niche we suddenly decide we can't live without it. 

Like the tablet or fitness tracker it seems modern consumers are suddenly fascinated by the idea of a coupe–style SUV. 

Audi wants to add a pair – a small one based on the Q5 and wearing a TT badge and another, likely called Q6, based on the new Q7 – and Mercedes-Benz is doing the same – the new GLC and GLE coupes. 

Both brands are reacting though to the original brand that answered the question nobody asked. 

BMW began the trend for SUVs blended with a coupe in 2008 with the launch of the X6. Effectively a swoopy roofed version of the X5 it broke the rules of convention (and arguably common sense) by offering coupe styling and cramped rear seat accommodation in a full-size SUV. 

Since then the smaller X4 has followed but for 2015 the X6 has reached mid-life and has been given a freshen-up. 

What do you get? 

For 2015 BMW have focused on adding equipment and just made some cosmetic changes to spruce up the car. 
 
Leather on the instrument panel, adaptive LED headlights, driving assistance technology and standard 20-inch alloy wheels across the range are some of the big ticket changes. 

The range starts at $115,400 (plus on-road costs) for the xDrive30d we're testing here and steps up through the xDrive35i ($120,700), xDrive40d ($128,400), xDrive50i ($151,600) and tops out with the M50d ($157,900). Later this year the X6 M will join, priced from $194,700 (plus costs) and packing a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8. 

Standard equipment on the xDrive30d includes heads-up display, auto tailgate, front and rear parking sensors plus surround view parking cameras, dual-zone climate control aircon, 10-inch colour screen, in-built DVD player, Bluetooth, satellite navigation and leather trim. 

You can customise the X6 to your personal taste with BMW's lengthy list of optional features. 

What's inside? 

BMW have made a concerted effort to make the X6 cabin feel more special, befitting the car's place near the top of the German brand's range. 

At first glance the interior of our test car looks and feels more premium than the previous model. It still has the trademark BMW touches though, iDrive and big, tablet-style screen at the top of the centre console, and a thick rimmed, leather-wrapped steering wheel. 

But the new leather finish to the top of the dashboard lends the X6 a more premium feel. It's a subtle change but it makes a big impression, especially when coupled with the aluminium-look trim highlights. 

Other highlights are the thick rimmed steering wheel, large colour infotainment screen and easier-to-use iDrive system. 

The front seats are also finished in leather and are both comfortable and supportive but the sloping roofline continues to compromise rear headroom for adults – and even tall teenagers. 

Boot space has increased by 75 litres over the old model to 585 litres. 

Under the bonnet 

The xDrive30d is the efficiency leader in the X6 family using 6.0 litres per 100km on the combined urban\/extra urban cycle. That is the sort of return you can expect from some small cars. 

That alone is impressive but the 30d backs up that economy with some equally impressive performance figures. The 3.0-litre six-cylinder turbocharged diesel produces 190kW of power and a hefty 560Nm of torque. 

That's enough to haul the 30d from 0-100km\/h in just 6.7secs, another impressive number given the size, weight and luxury of the X6. 

It imbues the X6 with a feeling of effortless; overtaking is easy, it can cruise comfortably and it can also become a sporty performer when called upon. 

It is supported by a smooth, efficient eight-speed automatic gearbox that does a great job of ensuring the engine stays in the sweet spot but also sips fuel sparingly. 

On the road 

BMW built its reputation as the ""ultimate driving machines"" on the back of fun-to-drive sedans and coupes over decades. The company has managed to transfer that engagement into its SUVs, particularly the X6. 

It still feels big and heavy when you throw it into some corners but the suspension is very well controlled and keeps the X6 sitting relatively flat and stable. The steering is also very responsive and gives the driver a feeling of confidence. 

The 20-inch alloys are wrapped in plenty of rubber so there is good grip in the corners too. 

However, the downside of the firm suspension tune and big wheels is a ride that can crash sharply over large bumps. 

Verdict 

The merits of the X6 vary greatly depending on how you look at it and intend to use it. If you're after a family-friendly but sporty SUV it is compromised by its swooping styling and simply doesn't make sense when compared to cheaper, more spacious and more conventional X5. 

However if you want a performance biased SUV, and intend on using the front seats primarily, then the X6 offers up impressive dynamics and – for now at least – a unique sense of style.

German premium brand was hoping to show off its two new plug-in hybrids, the 225xe Active Tourer and the 330e Video Images German luxury carmaker BMW's new chief executive, Harald Krueger, faints on stage at the Frankfurt auto show. BMW later confirmed Krueger is stable and recovering well. Video: Reuters BMW chief executive Harald Krueger falls to the ground during the opening press conference for the Frankfurt motor show Michael Taylor Frankfurt

Topics: Life & Style Motors Harald Krueger Maximilian Schoeberl Norbert Reithofer BMW Germany More Topics Tue, Sep 15, 2015, 10:27 First published: Tue, Sep 15, 2015, 10:21 BMW is denying any long-term implications after its CEO Harald Krueger collapsed on stage while giving a speech in Frankfurt on Tuesday.

The 49-year-old Dr Krueger was treated by a doctor after he collapsed in a “moment of dizziness”, BMW spokesman Maximilian Schoeberl said.

Mr Schoeberl insisted the CEO was already feeling unwell before the early morning presentation after recently returned from a series of intercontinental business trips. 

He explained Dr Krueger was stable and recovering well after grabbing his head and collapsing to the floor. 

Dr Krueger was able to walk off the stage with help from to BMW staffers, though the presentation was thrown into disarray and the Bavarian company never had the chance to properly present its two new plug-in hybrids, the 225xe Active Tourer and the 330e.

Dr Kreuger was only recently promoted to the top job at BMW following the departure of his predecessor, Norbert Reithofer, to the position of BMW Group Supervisory Board Chairman, in May this year.

It was Dr Kreuger’s first presentation as BMW CEO at the company’s biennial home motor show. He was previously BMW’s director of production.

Mr Schoeberl would not comment on any potential share-market implications on the high-profile incident at Germany’s largest trade show, though insiders suggested any fallout would be cushioned because an unusually large percentage of BMW’s shares are tied up within the Munich-based Quandt family.

The 330e is a production-ready, rear-drive, plug-in hybrid version of the 3-Series, which gives its heartland sedan 185kW of combined system power and 420Nm of torque.

While it quotes an official NEDC combined fuel economy figure of 1.9 litres\/100km and a CO2 emissions figure of 44 grams\/km, it is still good for a 0-100km sprint in 6.1 seconds.

The 1660kg sedan has a 225km\/h top speed and can run for up to 40km as a pure-electric car, at speeds of up to 120km\/h.

It combines a 135kW\/290Nm version of the 2.0-litre, four-cylinder, twin-scroll turbo petrol motor with a 65kW\/250Nm electric motor, which is mounted between the engine and the eight-speed automatic transmission.

Though the lithium-ion battery only 7.6kW\/h of energy, it also shrinks the luggage capacity down to 370 litres because it raises the height of the boot floor.

The 225xe is an all-wheel drive, plug-in hybrid version of the 2-Series Active Tourer, which effectively runs the powertrain of the i8 sports car, but turned around backwards.

It’s a rear-wheel drive car when it runs in electric mode, front drive when the 1.5-litre, three-cylinder petrol motor is doing the driving or all-wheel drive when both motors are called on.

Based on the UKL architecture (and, therefore, likely to come in the next generation MINI Countryman and Cooper, plus the next X1 and X2 BMWs), the 225xe does away with any mechanical links between the front and rear axles.

It reaches 100km\/h in 6.7 seconds and has a 202km\/h top speed, but delivers a 2.0-litre\/100km (46 grams\/km) economy figure on the NEDC cycle.

The 1660kg five-door hatch has the potential, BMW said, of 41km of pure electric range. The extra 150kg comes from the 7.7kW\/h lithium-ion battery, the steel fuel tank (it’s usually plastic), the electronics controller and the need to run a two-speed transmission at the rear for the electric motor as well as the traditional six-speed automatic.

It has 165kW and 385Nm, with 100kW and 200Nm of that coming from the 1.5-litre, direct-injection turbo petrol engine up front. It also has a 15kW electric motor attached directly to its petrol engine, which acts as the starter motor, the generator and acts as an overbooster on hard acceleration.. BMW to expand hybrid range at Frankfurt. The centerpiece of BMW's Frankfurt motor show stand will undoubtedly be its all new ultra-luxurious, very connected 7 Series. However, the German carmaker will also be using the event to continue honoring its commitment to greener, more environmentally conscious motoring with the launch of two new cars that use the company's ‘eDrive' plug-in hybrid technology -- the 330e compact executive sedan and the 225xe Active Tourer equally compact MPV. 
 

 
The BMW 225xe and 330e 
 
What sets BMW's hybrids apart from say a Toyota Prius, is that as well as enabling greater fuel economy and electric-only driving for emissions-free traversing of urban areas, eDrive also enhances performance. 
 
Just like in the current crop of hybrid hypercars -- the Ferrari LaFerrari, the McLaren P1 and the Porsche 918 Spyder -- in BMW's family-oriented vehicles the electric and traditional motors work together for increased horsepower, faster acceleration off the line and for smooth progression right around the rev counter. Turbocharging an engine makes it more powerful without making it drink more fuel. 
 
However, there is often a lag between depressing the accelerator and the car jumping into action as the turbos need time to spool up. With eDrive, the electric motor fills in these gaps so everything is always instantaneous and seamless. The technology also offers a boost function which, like in Formula One, will dump all power available to the driven wheels when immediate extra speed is a necessity, such as for motorway overtaking. 
 
Yet both cars are capable of traveling at speeds of over 70mph (112km\/h) on battery power alone and over a distance of over 30km before the lithium ion cells need recharging. This can be done via a standard socket at home or a dedicated charging station. Power from the traditional engine and energy recuperated under braking can also be used to top up while on the go, but not to fully replenish the cells during longer drives. 
 
BMW was one of the first mainstream premium marques to start investing heavily in alternative fuel technology, from hydrogen fuel cells to full battery power and hybrid systems. However it is only over the past 18 months that the company has been bringing these developments to market in its cars. 
 
This lateness to the party was due to solving the puzzle at the heart of the BMW brand -- how to build cars that are kinder to the environment but that still offer the serious driving dynamics on which the company's reputation was built? 
 
It would seem that eDrive, which also incorporates weight-saving materials in vehicle construction and turbocharging technology is the solution to this quandary and by the end of the year there will be four eDrive hybrid cars available in the mainstream BMW range including an eDrive version of the new 7 Series.

The Fast and The Friendly: Must Have Hybrid Supercars. U.S. stocks set to jump at open; Europe surges as VW board meets. U.S. stock futures shot higher Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said improving economic conditions would allow policymakers to begin raising interest rates this year.

Yellen suggested in a speech after markets closed Thursday that global economic weakness won’t be significant enough to alter the central bank’s plan to raise its key short-term rate from near zero by December. Uncertainty over the Fed’s timetable for raising rates has been weighing on the market.

Here is where major market index futures stood ahead of the start of regular trading: European markets rebounded Friday, ahead of the announcement of a new CEO at scandal-hit Volkswagen.

France’s CAC 40 surged 3.5% and Britain’s FTSE 100 index rose 2.6%. Germany’s DAX index rose 3%, helped by a 4% rise in shares in BMW. The company saw a big drop Thursday on a report that one of its models exceeded European emissions limits. The report did not allege any cheating by BMW.

In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index gained 1.8% to close at 17,880.51 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.4%. The Shanghai composite index lost 1.6%, closing at 3092.35.

Stocks back in correction territory. (CNNMoney) -  
America's stock market is back in correction territory. 

The S&P 500 on Thursday dropped 10% below its most recent intraday high set on May 20. 

The markets have had a bad week on a slew of confusing and negative news. The S&P 500 has suffered losses every day this week while the Dow -- which is still in correction mode from its May 19 intraday high -- has lost 600 points since last Thursday. The Nasdaq, which is also in a correction, is down 3% so far this year week too. 
 
Several members of the Federal Reserve's committee spoke publicly earlier this week to clarify why the central bank didn't raise its key interest rate last week. But their comments only confused investors more. 

Investors could get more clarity when Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks Thursday evening in Amherst, Mass. 

Negative news dominated headlines. China's manufacturing index dropped to a 78-month low. It's another sign that China's economy, the world's second largest, could be slowing down more than previously. That would weaken the global economic outlook even further. 

Corporate news has also been a downer. The Volkswagen emissions scandal has led to the resignation of its CEO, Martin Winterkorn, and its stock has plunged 30% since the news broke. 

On Thursday, another report found that BMW too was cheating on its emissions standards. 

And in the U.S., one of America's largest companies Caterpillar announced it was lowering its earnings outlook and that it will cut more than 10,000 jobs by 2018. 

It's still important to note that most Wall Street experts believe the S&P 500 will finish this year with gains. That's looking like a tough target now -- the S&P 500 is down 7% so far this year.. BMW Loans a i3 to Los Angeles Police Department for Evaluation. BMW i today announced that it will loan the Los Angeles Police Department a BMW i3 electric vehicle for twelve months in the first US test of the innovative EV in an authority fleet. The BMW i3 test vehicle, which sports the famous LAPD black and white livery, complete with rooftop light-bar, will undergo a year of rigorous testing. It will also be featured at public events throughout the loan period. 
 
“The decision by the Los Angeles Police Department to undertake this evaluation highlights the compelling nature of the BMW i3 as a versatile, sustainable vehicle,” noted Christine Fleischer, Manager – BMW i for BMW of North America. “By virtue of its innovative design and construction from leading-edge materials, the i3 is a brilliant fit with the technology-driven research philosophy of the LAPD. This will be a valuable learning experience for both BMW and the Department.” 
 
The LAPD will benefit from the compact size and agility of the vehicle, thanks to the light-weight Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic construction of the BMW i3. The very tight turning circle of the i3 will make maneuvring around the streets of Los Angeles a breeze. The LAPD will have access to the large, conveniently located network of BMW i Centers, making servicing of an i3 fleet convenient and cost effective. 
 
Watch for the “LAPD” BMW i3 on the streets and at events around Los Angeles over the coming months. 
 About the BMW i3, the company’s first-ever production electric vehicle  
The BMW i3 is the first of the BMW i vehicles constructed from the ground up primarily of carbon fiber to enter the US market. With 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque hybrid-synchronous electric motor, the fully electric BMW i3 is electrified by a 22-kWh lithium-ion battery, good for 80-100 miles of emission-free driving. Agile and engaging to drive, the BMW i3 is ideally suited for dense urban areas. Every aspect of the BMW i3 has been conceived for sustainability. The carbon fiber used to create the i3 is produced using hydro-electric power. The BMW i production facility in Leipzig, Germany draws much of its power from wind energy. Even the interior of the BMW i3 was created using sustainably-sourced materials. 
 
The BMW i3 has a base MSRP of $42,400 and the range-extender model starts at $46,250, before any federal or applicable state incentives.

Have you heard the one about the cop car that cost $105,000? You may see one soon being driven by an officer from the Los Angeles Police Department, so it isn’t a punch line by any means. In fact, even pricey electric vehicles from Tesla and BMW can teach city fleet managers about cutting municipal waste and making operations greener (not to mention quieter). The LAPD is about to see how these two cars and hundreds of other EVs hold up to the rigors of police work. 
 
At a September 11 press conference, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck (a 1970s Tom Selleck ringer, according to some) announced they would have a Tesla Model S P85D ($105,000) and BMW i3 ($42,400) on loan from the automakers for the next year. In addition, LA will lease 160 pure electric vehicles and 128 plug-in hybrids to handle municipal services.

Had LA paid for it, the i3 would cost below $35,000 before California incentives, bringing it close to the cost of a standard police cruiser. Factor in the $5,000 in fuel savings over five years compared to a car running at 24 miles per gallon and it actually would be a reasonable buy. (Presumably, the 288 models LA will lease have much lower sticker prices .) 
 
The city’s EV binge is a continuation of policies laid out in Garcetti’s Sustainable City pLAn that will make 50% of municipal vehicle purchases electric by 2017. In a city with so many vehicles spewing smoke from tailpipes every day, these initiatives are essential for controlling air quality standards, but Garcetti and Chief Beck can sell this policy to Angelenos in other ways. 
 
For starters, the city says it will cut vehicle operating costs by 41% by going electric ($0.21 per mile in EVs versus $0.37 in gas cars). That will free up resources to invest in infrastructure improvements in various municipal agencies. Impacts on the quality of life in LA may be more subtle but should be just as appealing to Angelenos.

The silent operation of pure electric vehicles makes patrolling cop cars less offensive to city residents late at night and early in the day. Likewise, any emissions from electricity generation stay out of the local environment and remain at the site of area power plants. So Angelenos can’t blame the noise or poor air quality on the cops. 
 
As for police work, the LAPD has several advantages when turning to a BMW i3, the most economical car on the U.S. market at 137 miles per gallon equivalent in city driving. The small frame and tight steering capabilities  of the i3 make it a smarter vehicle for handling traffic violations and similar city patrols. Being able to sneak up on perpetrators is an edge the LAPD has already enjoyed with electric motorcycles and electric scooters in the fleet. 
 
For its part, Tesla’s wicked Model S P85D offers 713 pounds-feet of torque and performance worthy of its price tag. Speeding perps in any type of car will have a hard time outracing a P85D that can sprint to 60 miles in 3.1 seconds and cover a quarter-mile in under 11 seconds. It’s not even fair. 
 
There is likely no police force that can justify expensing a six-figure cruiser for its fleet, but future reductions in battery costs may allow Tesla to provide municipalities with cop cars that deliver fierce acceleration for less. Imagine what fleet sales could do for a company currently focused on the luxury market. (Or recall what the fleet business has done for Detroit automakers.) 
 
With so many available charging stations around the city and such a clean grid, Los Angeles is also the ideal place to manage an electric vehicle fleet. The city is already sold on plug-ins for administrative services, detective work, and other low-impact police duties. A pricey Tesla and BMW should serve as a peek into the future where EVs will be the only cars the force needs. In the meantime, the Nissan Leaf ($21,510 post-incentive) and Ford Focus Electric ($21,670) can serve as the workhorses.

   Big business supports lobby groups that block climate action     
 A new study has found 45% of the 100 largest global industrial companies are blocking climate change legislation, while 95% of these companies are members of trade associations demonstrating the same obstructive tactics. 

The findings were published by the newly formed London-based, non-profit InfluenceMap, using a unique research methodology developed with US based Union of Concerned Scientists. 

Gretchen Goldman, lead analyst at the Union of concerned Scientists, said big business was often hiding behind lobby organisations to dampen down climate action regulations. 

She added: “More and more, we’re seeing companies rely on their trade groups to do their dirty work of lobbying against comprehensive climate policies. Companies get the delay in policy they want, while preventing nations from acting to fight climate change.  It is unacceptable that companies can obstruct climate action in this way without any accountability.” 

The research also shows that corporate influence over climate extends beyond the activities normally associated with lobbying, including intervention in the public discourse on climate change science and policy via advertising, PR, social media, and access to decision makers, as well as the use of influencers, such as trade associations and advocacy groups. 

Breaking this obstructive trend, Unilever (owners of Dove, Knorr, Flora and other brands) are ranked as leaders in InfluenceMap's scoring system, supporting multiple strands of climate policy globally.  This contrasts with rivals Procter & Gamble (owners of brands Gillette, Wella and Ariel), which, despite their stated support for action on climate change, are members of BusinessEurope (recently under attack in the UK media for their obstructionist stance towards climate legislation) and the secretive US industry group, NEDA\/CAP, who have been suing the US EPA to prevent them using the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. 

Other trade associations, including the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the American Petroleum Institute, National Association of Manufacturers, US Chamber of Commerce, Business Council of Australia, and the all-powerful Japan Business Federation, which counts almost every major Japanese firm as a member, have all strongly opposed most climate legislation for years. 

InfluenceMap's research found that despite their public communications, few corporations have actually supported the progressive climate policies being proposed by governments globally. There also remains a lack of transparency around their relationships with trade associations, with very few companies willing to publicly challenge them despite clear misalignment between their climate positions and the actions of the associations. 

That said, almost half of the world’s largest companies have also recently been involved in directly advocating against climate policy, including BMW, BASF and Boeing, all companies which highlight their own sustainability credentials. 

Paul Dickinson, Executive Chairman of CDP, commented: “There is a lack of detailed analysis available in this area and sadly great companies sometimes do bad things by lobbying against government action to avoid dangerous climate change."" 

Investors are increasingly using sustainability ratings to inform their decision-making processes. Dylan Tanner, InfluenceMap, Executive Director, said: “Mainstream fund managers are now attaching climate-lobbying criteria to their investment decisions, such as the $850 billion Norwegian Government Pension Fund, which in April of this year announced new standards allowing it to exclude companies responsible for unacceptable levels of greenhouse gas emissions, criteria that are likely to include obstructive influence over climate policy.”

Clear, binding specifications and processes are in place through all phases of development at the BMW Group in order to avoid wrongdoing. 

Two studies carried out by the ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation) have confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested comply with the legal requirements concerning NOx emissions. No discrepancies were found in the X5 between laboratory-test and field-test NOx emissions.

The German magazine Auto Bild has published a clarification of their article released yesterday (September 24

©2015 PR Newswire. All Rights Reserved.. BMW, Mercedes deny emissions rigging. BMW Group and Mercedes-Benz's parent company Daimler have officially distanced themselves from the diesel emissions rigging scandal engulfing German compatriot Volkswagen Group, following speculation that their vehicles also exceed legal emissions limits.

The luxury car giants have both issued statements over the weekend denying that they manipulate emissions figures to meet regulations.

German magazine Auto Bild has been forced to publish a clarification on an article claiming the NOx (oxides of nitrogen) emissions of a BMW X3 were 11 times higher than the legal limit, and Daimler has publicly hit back at speculation from non-government organisation German Environmental Aid (DUH).

BMW's statement said the company is ""committed to observing the legal requirements in each country and fulfilling all local testing requirements"".

""In other words, our exhaust treatment systems are active whether rolling on the test bench or driving on the road.""

Meanwhile, Daimler ""categorically denies the accusation of manipulating emission tests regarding our vehicles"".

""A defeat device, a function which illegitimately reduces emissions during testing, has never been and will never be used at Daimler,"" said the company in a statement. ""This holds true for both diesel and petrol engines. Our engines meet and adhere to every legal requirement.""

In defending itself against the Auto Bild accusation, BMW cited two studies performed by the International Council on Clean Transportation (which discovered the discrepancies in VW vehicles ""confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested comply with the legal requirements concerning NOx emissions"".

Auto Bild was made to publish the following clarification: ""No evidence of emission manipulation by BMW…. The values mentioned in the document were only generated in a single, one hour-long road test. Auto Bild has no access to the details of this test trail, which might explain the discrepancies to the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) test.""

BMW also pointed out that ""no discrepancies were found in the X5 between laboratory-test and field-test NOx emissions"".

""Clear, binding specifications and processes are in place through all phases of development at the BMW Group in order to avoid wrongdoing,"" said the company.

Referring to seven questions posed by DUH, demanding answers within just a few hours, Daimler confirmed ""that none of the allegations apply to our vehicles. The technical programming of our engines adheres to all legal requirements"".

""We have no knowledge of measurements that indicate our vehicles did not meet legally required standards … we work closely and constructively with the responsible authorities in Germany, Europe and the United States and will willingly provide any vehicle for testing.""

Daimler also pointed out that it is ""evaluating legal options pertaining to the approach taken and the public assertions made by the DUH"".

DUH has also implicated Ford and Opel in its accusations of widespread noncompliance with European emissions legislation, but neither company has yet responded publicly.

However responses to its requests were published on the DUH website, with Ford denying use of a ""so-called defeat device"".

""Our vehicles and engines – including the highly modern diesel engines – comply with the European low emission,"" said the response from Ford (translated from German).

Opel said that ""GM developed software does not have any features that detect whether a vehicle is just in emission test cycles"" (also translated from German).

""Modern Diesel driving is indispensable for the achievement of European climate change objectives.""

BMW echoed Opel's sentiment about the importance of diesel engines in achieving CO2 emissions reduction targets.

""Policymakers worldwide, and in particular in the European Union, are setting tough standards for CO2 and other emissions. The 2020 targets in Europe can only be fulfilled through extensive use of modern diesel engines and further electrification,"" it said.

""The progress achieved so far in CO2 reduction in Europe is largely due to the use of diesel technology. Meeting future requirements will not be feasible without diesel drive trains, since a diesel engine emits roughly 15 to 20 per cent less CO2 on average than a comparable petrol engine.""

Both BMW and Daimler pledged to assist with European efforts to develop new testing methods that will more accurately replicate the emissions and fuel consumption of real-world driving.. BMW's the Next German Automaker Under Fire Over Emissions. RSS News Feeds

DEKRA Announces BMW Team RLL's BMW Z4 GTE Green Challenge Winner of TUDOR Championship Race in Austin, TX. ATLANTA, GA -- (Marketwired) -- 09\/21\/15 --  DEKRA North America, Inc. congratulates #24 BMW Team RLL's BMW Z4 GTE as the winner, for the second time, of the DEKRA Green Challenge Award in the Lone Star Le Mans at Circuit of the Americas race held in Austin, TX on September 19, 2015. DEKRA is the sponsor of the DEKRA Green Challenge Award, which is presented to the most environmentally clean, fast, and efficient GT Le Mans (GTLM) competitor in each TUDOR United SportsCar Championship Race. 

The DEKRA Green Challenge Award is a centerpiece of the Green Racing partnership between the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). DEKRA consults with IMSA to review Green Challenge results to ensure they conform to the established scoring criteria. 
   
""DEKRA has a long tradition of involvement with elite motorsports events and series, and we are very excited to be partnering with IMSA and the TUDOR Championships,"" said Donald O. Nicholson, CEO and President of DEKRA NA. ""As a leader in automotive emissions and safety testing and sustainability, we are proud to sponsor the DEKRA Green Challenge Award, which recognizes these elite green racers."" 
  
All of the GTLM class teams competing in the TUDOR Championship must utilize alternative fuels, either E85, E10 or biodiesel. E85 and E10 are made from 85 and 10 percent ethanol respectively and are derived from products grown by U.S. farmers. The GTLM Class is the only class within the TUDOR Series that uses E85. Currently, all but one of the GTLM teams uses E85. These alternative fuels are relevant to the world's automotive manufacturers and energy companies as they develop transportation solutions for the future that are sustainable and have a low environmental impact. 

The Green Challenge scores are calculated each lap of the race from data provided by the timing and scoring system plus the observed energy consumption -- or fuel used -- of each car from refueling tank sensors. The score for ""clean"" is based on a rating of each car's environmental impact determined by adding together the greenhouse gases emitted and non-renewable energy (petroleum consumed) by each car during the race. ""Fast"" describes the average on-track speed of each car compared to the leader (recalculated for every lap) in kilometers per hour. ""Efficiency"" is measured by how well each car used the energy it consumed based on the car's observed fuel consumption and performance, corrected to the performance profile and weight of the leader. 

""Much of the interest in ethanol as a vehicle fuel is its ability to replace gasoline made from imported oil,"" said Nicholson. ""E85 fuel also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it is made from ethanol produced in the U.S. from corn grown by American farmers. DEKRA is excited to be part of this new vision for the future."" 

DEKRA also serves as IMSA's Official Technical Partner, operating in conjunction with IMSA during the TUDOR Series technical inspection process of each race car to ensure IMSA regulations and standards are being followed. As unbiased, third-party experts, DEKRA adds credibility to IMSA's technical and safety inspection process. 

Every TUDOR Championship race car is inspected at the DEKRA Technical Center and receives a DEKRA decal showing that it has met IMSA's regulations and technical standards. While IMSA's specs are unique, DEKRA has a similarly rigorous process for the safety and quality inspections it offers corporate and consumer clients. DEKRA is the leading consumer and commercial vehicle testing organization in the world with 26 million inspections conducted annually. 

The 2015 TUDOR Championship season opened at Daytona International Speedway with the 53rd Rolex 24 At Daytona. There are 12 races each year across the U.S. and Canada, which attract over a million fans and include racers from Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Corvette, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Porsche, SRT, Ferrari, and Lamborghini. 

About DEKRA 
DEKRA has been active in the field of safety for 90 years. Founded in 1925 in Berlin, Germany, the company is one of the world's leading expert organizations today. DEKRA generated sales of around EUR 2.5 billion in 2014. The company currently employs around 35,000 people in more than 50 countries on five continents. DEKRA North America is headquartered in Marietta, Georgia. DEKRA's qualified and independent experts work for safety on the road, at work and at home.

BERLIN, Sept 24 (Reuters) - BMW said it has not manipulated emissions tests, denying a magazine report saying some of its diesel cars were found to exceed emissions standards. 

""There is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on (test) rollers or on the road,"" the German luxury-car maker said on Thursday. 

German trade magazine Auto Bild said earlier on Thursday that BMW's X3 xDrive 20d model exceeded ""Euro 6"" emissions limits more than 11-fold in road tests by the International Council on Clean Transportation…. LA police commit to a greener future with electric cop cars, even a Tesla. The city introduced a fleet of 160 purely battery-powered electric vehicles and 128 hybrid cars for use by city departments on Friday, saying it will help reduce operating costs Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, right and Police Chief Charlie Beck sit behind the wheel of an electric car which will be used the city's police department, on Friday. The city will begin leasing 160 battery-powered vehicles and 128 plug-in hybrid cars as part of an effort to cut costs and focus on sustainability. (Nick Ut\/AP) Moving forward with a vision to make Los Angeles a more sustainable city and perhaps reduce its infamous smog, Mayor Eric Garcetti revealed on Friday that the city will begin leasing a raft of electric cars, including 160 fully-battery powered vehicles, for use primarily by the Los Angeles Police Department. The move, announced on a sweltering day outside police headquarters, will give the city the largest number of purely electric vehicles in the country, Mr. Garcetti said. Describing electric cars as “the future,” he said the new vehicles made sense for environmental and economic reasons. “Our goal is to one day go from gas-powered to battery electric in our squad cars. And if we do that, the impact could be national in scale. LA could once again the lead the way to help transform not just our department, but other departments and cities around the country,” Garcetti said at Friday’s announcement, according to the Los Angeles Times. The city will also add 128 plug-in hybrid cars, along with a loaned Tesla Model S P85D and BMW i, which the mayor showcased on Friday. One hundred vehicles will be used exclusively by the police department, shared among detectives, investigators, and administrative employees, the mayor’s office said in a statement. It’s still unclear how the police department will actually use the new electric vehicles. Some sources have suggested (with various levels of seriousness) that the cars’ nearly silent engines could be an advantage for police hoping to catch a crime in progress. Observers on Twitter have pointed out that the Tesla – which can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds, a feature the company calls “insane mode” – could be used to chase fleeing suspects: LAPD pulls up behind you in a P85D Tesla you just gotta give up right then and there. Don't even try and run. While Mayor Garcetti did suggest that the new cars were “quick” and “quiet enough to sneak up on someone,” on Friday – which prompted a smile from Police Chief Charlie Beck, according to the Times – the city’s official explanation about how the police will use the expensive loaner vehicles is more benign. “These vehicles will be used for testing and research by LAPD technical experts to determine how this technology can support their future needs,” the mayor's office said in the statement. The department’s purchase comes on the heels of an ambitious citywide environmental plan released earlier this year. Known as the Sustainable City pLAn, it aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 and eliminate the water and power department’s use of coal entirely by 2035. But charging the new vehicles may prove to be a concern, partly because of the environmental impact of using electricity generated by traditional coal-based plants as opposed to less widely-available wind and solar energy. Charging a typical midsize sedan using coal-based electricity results in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to driving a similar distance in a gas-based car rated at 30 miles per gallon, according to a 2012 report by researchers at the Union of Concerned Scientists. But the report notes, many gas-based cars typically have lower fuel economy, making electric and hybrid cars more efficient even if they are charged using electricity from coal-fired plants. Los Angeles has been slowly building a fleet of electric vehicles over time, with the new cars joining 67 existing vehicles, including 23 electric scooters and three electric motorcycles previously purchased by the police department, according to the mayor’s office. The 288 new vehicles will be shared by other city agencies, with the fully-electric vehicles leased by the Police, Fire, and General Services departments and the hybrid vehicles shared by the Water and Power Department and the General Services Department. Mr. Beck, the police chief, said the department’s purchase will both save the city money – cutting the operating costs for police vehicles by 41 percent, to 21 cents a mile – and provide an example for other cities about the many uses for electric cars. “I think that today, this announcement, will trickle across the nation as a challenge to other cities, other police departments, other fire departments to look at what you're doing and to take a step that makes a change for the positive,"" he said on Friday, according to the Times.

1920x1440	The new BMW 4 Series Convertible
The new BMW 4 Series Convertible heralds a new era in the premium mid-size range of open cars offered by BMW. The new design language introduced with the BMW 4 Series Coupe is even more evident in this second model of the series, enhancing the appearance of the BMW 4 Series Convertible while setting new standards in terms of dynamics, elegance and extraordinary driving pleasure – with the top up or down. In addition to having its own distinct design, the BMW 4 Series Convertible sets itself apart from its BMW 3 Series cousins through a number of distinguishing technical features. The new BMW 4 Series Convertible is visibly larger in width, track and wheelbase than the BMW 3 Series Convertible. The vehicle’s impeccable balance of proportions and characteristic flowing lines stem from the typical BMW short overhangs front and rear, the stretched bonnet and set-back passenger compartment. The striking BMW design features up front – such as the double-kidney grille, twin circular headlights and the large air intakes in the front apron – are keen to display this convertible’s family ties with the BMW 3 Series. However, the dynamic convictions of the BMW 4 Series Convertible are expressed by elements such as the so-called Air Breathers positioned rearward of the front wheel arches. Together with the Air Curtains, these elements reduce turbulence and aerodynamic drag at the front wheels. The markedly flat design of the boot area at the rear underlines the flowing harmony of the overall vehicle silhouette. Horizontal lines and muscular wheel arches combine to accentuate the car’s wide track and rear-wheel drive concept. Improved roof design and construction. Extra comfort. More functionality. The design language of the new BMW 4 Series Convertible is reflected in the car’s unmistakable and elegant silhouette with balanced proportions when the top is down, and in the sleek look of the roofline – without a B column – when the hardtop is closed. The three-piece retractable hardtop of the BMW 4 Series Convertible is distinguished by advanced soundproofing with its “noise-absorbing” headliner, ensuring quietness and genuine passenger comfort under all weather conditions – even in winter. The interior roof is fully lined and features lamps that add to the ambience expected of a premium sport coupe. When the top is down and stored in the boot, the standard load and unload assistance function pivots the folded roof in the luggage compartment upwards to provide ample storage space and easy access. Thus even large and bulky items and luggage can be conveniently stowed when the top is down. The low and sporty seats ensure more headroom as well as added rear legroom in comparison to the predecessor model. Individual equipment lines and exclusive details. The interior of the BMW Series 4 Convertible presents a stylish fusion of sporty allure, elegance and exclusivity. All of the controls are arranged ergonomically around the driver to provide optimum access to all functions. The doors are designed so that all the lines converge towards the rear, and bright colour combinations featuring a two-tone effect for the door and side panels contribute in combination with the hardtop cover to the “boat deck” look. This wrap-around interior design provides for a seating ensemble that allows all passengers to share the open-sky driving experience. The design of the seats is new and includes integrated seatbelts. The seats are electrically adjustable as standard. If desired, the standard seats and the optional sport seats with recessed head restraints can be equipped with neck warmers for the driver and front passenger, an optional extra available for the first time. When the top is down, the temperature setting is automatically controlled in relation to the outdoor temperature and the speed of the vehicle. In addition to the standard model, three specially equipped lines and an M Sport package are also available. The Sport Line, Modern Line and Luxury Line versions can be selected to personalise the new convertible with special interior and exterior accents. The fine materials and meticulous craftsmanship underline the premium ambience of the BMW 4 Series Convertible. Driving dynamics from the top drawer. In addition to the enjoyment of the unrivalled open-air driving experience at the push of a button, the BMW 4 Series Convertible also impresses with exhilarating performance and sovereign handling. BMW engineers have succeeded in making key improvements in areas such as steering accuracy, precision and agility. Sophisticated chassis technology, torque-steer-free Electric Power Steering, 50:50 weight distribution, a programme of fine-tuning in the wind tunnel and a lightweight construction concept enabled them to build an unadulterated driving machine. The sporty look of the convertible is evident in the longer wheelbase, wider track and standard lower suspension when compared with its predecessor model. Among many factors, the extremely low centre of gravity also accounts for the remarkable performance and handling of the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. Two petrol engines and one diesel available at model launch. At model launch the BMW 4 Series Convertible can be delivered with an in-line six-cylinder petrol engine (BMW 435i Convertible), a four-cylinder petrol engine (BMW 428i Convertible) and a four-cylinder diesel (BMW 420d Convertible). These engines cover the performance range from 135 kW\/184 hp to 225 kW\/306 hp and feature the latest BMW TwinPower Turbo technology. These state-of-the-art engines imbue the BMW 4 Series Convertible with outstanding acceleration and elasticity while intelligently reducing fuel consumption in compliance with the EU6 standard. Six-speed manual, eight-speed automatic or eight-speed Sports automatic transmission. The power from the engines is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual gearbox as standard. BMW also offers all engine variants with an optional eight-speed automatic transmission or an eight-speed Sports automatic transmission that allows the driver to change gears manually by using shift paddles on the steering wheel. All transmissions are equipped as standard with the Auto Start Stop function. And from the spring of 2014, intelligent four-wheel drive technology BMW xDrive will be available for the 428i Convertible. BMW EfficientDynamics. The sheer driving pleasure of the BMW 4 Series Convertible is accompanied by outstanding economy. The source of this low fuel consumption can be traced to BMW EfficientDynamics, with innovations that can be found throughout the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. In addition to the optimised fuel economy of the petrol and diesel engines, the intelligent lightweight construction concept and honed aerodynamics – headlined by the Air Curtains and Air Breathers – also help to maximise efficiency. Other features such as the Auto Start Stop function, Brake Energy Regeneration, the gear shift indicator, on-demand operation of ancillary units and the innovative Proactive Driving Assistant all do their part to ensure low fuel consumption and reduced emissions, without compromising driving performance. The ECO PRO mode can even lead to fuel savings of 20 per cent. In conjunction with the automatic transmission, the new convertible – like the BMW 4 Series Coupe – also features a coasting mode for the first time. BMW ConnectedDrive. BMW was early in recognising the significance of connecting the automobile with its environment through intelligent networking technologies and thus is able to offer unique mobility services and driver assistance systems. These innovations are available from the Connected Drive product range as standard or optional equipment for the BMW 4 Series Convertible and, for a limited time, some can even be ordered after the initial vehicle purchase. With these innovations, the new BMW 4 Series Convertible is setting standards in terms of safety, convenience and infotainment. Among the highlights are a new generation of the Navigation System Professional, the full-colour BMW Head-Up Display, the Driving Assistant, which warns the driver of a potential collision with a pedestrian, the intelligent, glare-free LED High Beam Assistant, Active Protection with Attentiveness Assistant and the latest development stage of the Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function.

Exotic Cars. BMW shares plunge on report it broke pollution limit. Another German automaker was dragged into the scandal over harmful emissions from diesel engines Thursday -- at least on the stock market. 
 
Shares in BMW slumped 8% to their lowest level in two years after a German magazine reported that at least one model had breached European pollution limits by a huge margin in road tests. 

Auto Bild said the BMW X3 xDrive 20d had produced 11 times as much nitrogen oxide as permitted in independent road tests conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation. 

The scandal erupted Friday when U.S. regulators revealed Volkswagen had cheated pollution tests on 500,000 vehicles by programming them to produce fewer emissions than they do in normal driving conditions. 

Since then, the world's biggest carmaker has admitted there could be problems with emissions in 11 million vehicles worldwide. Its shares have been slammed, CEO Martin Winterkorn has resigned, and prosecutors in the U.S. and Germany are considering legal action. 

The action by federal and California state regulators against Volkswagen had its origin in research conducted by the ICCT into emissions from three vehicles: a VW Jetta, a VW Passat, and a BMW X5. 

The Jetta and Passat cars produced way more nitrogen oxide than permitted. The BMW X5 was ""generally at or below the standard, and only exceeded it during rural uphill operating conditions,"" according to the ICCT. 

Auto Bild appears to be referring to a separate set of tests. 

""All the results indicate that this problem is not specific to VW,"" Auto Bild quoted ICCT expert Peter Mock as saying. 

BMW said it was not familiar with the BMW X3 road test mentioned in the article. 

""No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results. We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the test they carried out,"" it said in a statement. 

The company also repeated that it does not manipulate or rig any tests on its cars. 

""When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg. test bench situation) or on the road,"" BMW said. 

It's a measure of how nervous investors are about the potential fallout for European automakers that the stock was so hard hit in early dealing. It has lost about 40% since March. 

""Shares in BMW are weak again today on speculation that its diesel emissions test results may also have been doctored to appear eco-friendly and thus saleable in the world's second largest but arguably the most important car market, the U.S.,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.. BMW 4 Series Coupe Facelift Rendered: Looks Like the Real Deal. ⌖   2 Photos 
  
A-  A+ 
 
The BMW F30 3 Series facelift will soon reach customers around the world, with the new model bringing more technical updates than visual ones. BMW even brought out the revised version at Frankfurt and we have to admit it does look better than the original. 

The thing is, only the Sedan and the Touring models were on the receiving end of BMW’s attention span while the Gran Turismo and 4 Series range were left out. While we can understand why the 4 Series was left hanging, the GT is still a bit of a mystery. 
Since they decided to separate the 4 Series from the 3 Series, it was only natural for BMW to keep the facelifts for the two separated. There are more discrepancies between the Coupe\/Convertible\/Gran Coupe 4er and the 3 Series than you might imagine at first. 
 
Furthermore, the 4 Series was launched back in 2013 and it’s still too early to give it a facelift. The 3 Series, on the other hand, was launched back in 2011 and it was about time it received some new power plants and new tech to keep up with the competition. 
 
The 4er will be getting its own upgrades somewhere in 2017 and by then we might as well see the same headlight and taillight design being used on it. That’s why this rendering coming from RM Design is pretty much dead on in terms of details. 
 
The question that remains though is whether BMW will wait until then to upgrade the engine range or if they will replace the 428i and 435i models with new 430i and 440i versions earlier. As you may very well know, the 328i and 335i were pulled out of production along with the old generation of the 3 Series, the Germans offering us the 330i and 340i in their place. 
 
Our guess is that yes, they will provide a technical update before 2017 but it will be because of CO2 emission laws that are now demanding all manufacturers use EU6 engines on their new cars and the B48 and B58 mill are offering just that. Until an official confirmation comes, though, we still have to rely on sources and rumors. Let’s just hope that we won’t see the day a 4 Series uses a 3-cylinder engine as is the case on the 318i.

Gap between official fuel economy and real-world performance has become ‘chasm’, says T&E. The gap between official test results for CO2 emissions\/fuel economy and real-world performance has increased to 40% in 2014 from 8% in 2001, according to research by Transport & Environment (T&E). 

As a result, the campaign group gap says the gap “has become a chasm and, without action, will likely grow to 50% on average by 2020"". 
 
T&E added that the gap in performance found in many car models has grown so wide that it cannot be explained through known factors including test manipulations and it is calling on EU governments to extend probes into defeat devices to CO2 tests and petrol cars too. 
 
The organisation says its research shows the gap in performance is up to 50% for some models. Mercedes cars have an average gap between test and real-world performance of 48% and their new A, C and E class models have a difference of over 50%. The BMW 5 series and Peugeot 308 are just below 50%. 
 
Greg Archer, clean vehicles manager at T&E, said: “This widening gap casts more doubt on how carmakers trick their customers in Europe to produce much better fuel efficiency in tests than can be achieved on the road. The only solution is a comprehensive investigation into both air pollution and fuel economy tests and all car manufacturers to identify where unfair and illegal practices, like defeat devices, may be in use. There must also be a comprehensive overhaul of the testing system.”. BMW Wants to Assure Drivers it Isn't Fudging Emissions Tests. After diesel cars and rising concerns about emissions were thrown into the limelight last week, BMW has released a statement assuring customers that they aren’t performing the same behavior as Volkswagen – although they might now have scored well on some European emissions tests. 
 
“BMW Group is committed to observing the legal requirements in each country and fulfilling all local testing requirements,” the company said in a press release. “In other words, our exhaust treatment systems are active whether rolling on the test bench or driving on the road.” 
 
BMW’s X5 and other vehicles were tested by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the same group that found Volkswagen to be cheating using emission software, in two different studies. They found that, although the BMW X3 emits more than eleven times more pollution than the European Union allows, it isn’t actually equipped with anything illegal. 
 
Some car companies fudge testing using a technique called cycle beating, meaning that the car is tested while it is warming up instead of during the full drive cycle. This isn’t illegal within the European Union, although it does tend to produce results different from those found during everyday driving. 
 
The German car site Auto Bild reported BMW’s numbers on Sept. 24. 
 
On Sept. 25 BMW replied, noting that the article had been edited to clarify that BMW had not manipulated their emission readings. The article did note that “The values mentioned in the document were only generated in a single, one hour-long road test. Auto BILD has no access to the details of this test trail.” 
 
Along with the X5, 13 other BMW vehicles were tested to show that they complied with the EU rules about NOx emissions. 
 
Diesel vehicles accounted for 38 percent of the total BMW vehicles sold worldwide last year. In the wake of the Volkswagen news, BMW continued to push for their own diesel efforts, noting that they are continuing to work on diesel engines with emission levels well within EU policy as well as on increased electrification. 
 
The EU is currently working on revamping its vehicle test cycle in order to assure that its test results match real-life fuel consumption and emissions. The Euro 6 emissions standard was put in place on Sept. 1, 2. EUROPE MARKETS: European Stocks Seesaw; German Shares Pare Gains. By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch 

BMW shares drop on talk of emission troubles 

European stocks flailed Thursday, with German blue-chip shares unable to sustain stronger gains after a closely watched business survey came in better than anticipated. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.3% to 346.03, swinging lower in mid-morning trade. Germany's DAX 30 was up 0.1% at 9,620.40, but it had been up nearly 1% after the Ifo think-tank's survey of business confidence unexpectedly rose (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/german-business-climate-improves-unexpectedly-2015-09-24-44853227), to 108.5 in September. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a decline to 107.9. 

German companies expressed optimism about their business outlook. Such sentiment is coming at a time when worries about China's economic slowdown have been a major source of uncertainty and volatility in markets worldwide in recent weeks. It's still too early to tell if the turmoil surrounding Volkswagen will hurt other German companies, IFO economist Klaus Wohlrabe told the Journal Thursday. 

On the DAX, shares of Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE) (VOW.XE) were up 7.2%. The shares ended Wednesday's session higher by more than 5%, holding to gains after Martin Winterkorn resigned as the chief executive of the auto maker, which is engulfed in an emissions-fraud scandal. 

But stock in auto maker BMW AG (BMW.XE) turned lower by 1.6%. German press was raising concerns about emissions in BMW X3 models Thursday. 

On other European indexes, France's CAC 40 was up 0.1% at 4,439.19 and Spain's IBEX 35 picked up 0.5% at 9,523.80. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.1% at 6,037.39. Norway's central bank cut its key interest rate to 0.75% from 1% (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/norways-central-bank-cuts-rates-2015-09-24-44852249), saying it may need to lower it again as the effects of falling oil prices take a toll on the country's economic prospects. The U.S. dollar jumped more than 1% against the Norwegian krone.

(END) Dow Jones Newswires. BMW X3 diesel also caught up European emissions scandal. BMW denies.. The fallout from the Volkswagen emissions scandal continued to spread across Europe Thursday as regulators found the German giant had also cheated on tests in Europe as well as the U.S. and other carmakers were caught up in speculation about further manipulations.

 BMW X3 diesel also caught up European emissions scandal. BMW denies.. Automakers’ Denials of Cheating Actually Faster Than Many of Their Cars. This week, Daimler , BMW , Jaguar Land Rover and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles issued statements on how their diesel cars don’t cheat like someone else you may’ve heard of . 
 
“The BMW Group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests,” BMW said in a statement Thursday. “We observe the legal requirements in each country and fulfill all local testing requirements.” 
 
BMW’s admission is notable  because the automakers’ X3 diesel model was targeted by the independent commission that discovered that Volkswagen’s cars illegally polluted. 
 

 
In separate statements, Daimler said its diesel sedans comply with regulations after a German group said it had evidence that the automaker cheated on emissions tests  (via AutoGuide). 
 
We sharply deny the allegation that we manipulated our cars during emissions tests. We never did and do not now use a defeat device. 
 
FCA told Cars.com that it  “works closely and continually with the EPA and CARB (California Air Resource Board) to ensure its vehicles are compliant with all applicable requirements. FCA U.S. does not use ‘defeat devices.'” 
 
And anyone else who’s ever tried diesel — even once in college, after parents’ weekend — is denying any wrongdoing.

A sudden wave of scrutiny over emissions threatened to engulf BMW after a German magazine reported Thursday that one of the luxury automaker's diesel vehicles emitted 11 times the amount of nitrogen oxides acceptable in Europe. 

The German automaker's shares tumbled about 5% Thursday following Auto Bild magazine's report that the International Council on Clean Transportation had discovered curiously high emissions on the BMW X3 crossover vehicle. 

BMW issued a forceful statement denying any wrongdoing, saying in an email to USA TODAY that it ""does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests."" 

""We observe the legal requirements in each country and adhere to all local testing requirements,"" BMW said. ""When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg. test bench situation) or on the road."" 

The news comes after an ICCT investigation conducted in cooperation with West Virginia University researchers uncovered irregularities in the emissions performance of Volkswagen diesel cars . 

That prompted a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation that caused Volkswagen to admit it had rigged 11 million cars worldwide with cheating software , a scandal that has crushed the German automaker's stock, severely damaged the VW brand and triggered costs of more than $7 billion. 

To be sure, while Volkswagen intentionally misled regulators by installing the so-called ""defeat device"" on diesel vehicles, it's far from clear whether BMW or other automakers have used similarly deceptive software. 

BMW said it is ""not familiar with the test mentioned by Auto Bild"" but will ask ICCT ""for clarification of the test they carried out."" 

ICCT research has previously suggested that excessive nitrogen oxide emissions — which can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma — may not be exclusive to Volkswagen. 

In a report earlier this month , ICCT said that on-road testing of 32 European diesel cars from 10 automakers found that the average vehicle was generating nitrogen oxide emissions at twice the regulatory limit. 

Some ""manufacturers seem to be focusing on meeting emission limits over the current test cycle while neglecting real-world operating conditions,""ICCT study co-author Vicente Franco said in a statement.

Report: BMW X3 Diesel Emissions Also Exceed Legal Limit. -Volkswagen's unfolding diesel emissions crisis may prove to involve other automakers as well: German magazine Autobild reports that ​a German-market, diesel-powered BMW X3 xDrive 20d put out 11 times the legal limit of pollution in a test commissioned by the magazine.-
Automotive News, which translated the Autobild report, explains that the BMW was tested by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the same group whose findings led U.S. regulators to investigate Volkswagen's U.S. diesel models.-
Over at Jalopnik, Máté Petrány reports that the Euro-spec X3 tested by the magazine put out 11.88 times the Euro 6 limit for NOx emissions—slightly worse than a U.S.-spec Passat TDI tested by the magazine, but almost half of the emissions produced by a U.S.-spec Jetta TDI and a Euro-spec Audi A8 3.0 TDI included in the test.-
BMW denied the report, saying in a statement that ""there is no function to recognize emissions testing cycles at BMW. All emissions systems remain active outside the testing cycle."" BMW shares dropped nearly 10 percent in European trading as a result of the report.---How Volkswagen Got Busted for Skirting U.S. Diesel Emissions Standards-Volkswagen Group CEO Martin Winterkorn Resigns in Wake of Diesel Emissions Scandal-BMW X3 Full Coverage: Tests, Reviews, Specs, Photos and More---
In the wake of the ongoing diesel emissions crisis, the European Union urged all 28 member-countries to open investigations into real-world vehicle emissions. The German transport ministry vowed to conduct spot-checks on Volkswagens and other manufacturers alike, Bloomberg Business reports.-
Meanwhile at Volkswagen, the resignation of CEO Martin Winterkorn seems to be only the first executive-level departure: Bloomberg reports that Audi development chief Ulrich Hackenberg and Porsche development head Wolfgang Hatz will leave the company. The VW Group will announce Winterkorn's replacement tomorrow.-
UPDATE: Reached for comment by Car and Driver, BMW said ""The BMW Group…compl[ies] with all local test requirements,"" adding that ""our vehicles…in the exhaust gas treatment, [there is] no distinction between [test mode] and road operation."" The company also noted that in the ICCT's test, the X5 and 13 other BMW models ""meet the legal requirements for NOx emissions.""-
As for the X3 road test in question, the company said: ""The facts…on the emissions of the BMW X3 in the course of [the] road tests are not described in detail, are not known, and therefore [are] neither understandable or explainable. We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the conducted road tests.""-

Postage Rates. BMW shares fall on emissions concerns. BMW AG shares fell more than 8 per cent early on Thursday, after magazine Auto Bild reported one of the German car maker's model's emissions on the street were much higher than allowed in Europe under standardised testing conditions. 

The sharp stock market reaction underscores the skittishness among auto-industry investors in the wake of accusations by the US Environmental Protection Agency that Volkswagen AG used software to manipulate emissions-test results for its US-sold diesel passenger cars. Almost 500,000 Volkswagen-made cars in the US are affected, along with another 10.5 million Volkswagen-made cars around the world, the company has said. 

Environmental groups have in the past reported on discrepancies in emissions levels between test performance and road performance, but the issue has become much more sensitive to investors and car buyers in the wake of last week's EPA accusations against Volkswagen. Volkswagen has apologized for the software and said it is taking measures to identify and fix affected cars. 

Auto Bild, a German-based automotive publication, said on Thursday in a pre-release of an article to be published later this week that BMW's X3 xDrive 20d sports utility vehicle, powered by a diesel engine, emitted more than 11 times more nitrogen oxide than permitted by the European Union under standardized conditions. The magazine said the results came through a street test conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research organization. 

BMW said Thursday it hasn't manipulated test results. ""At the BMW group, there are no specific activities or technical provisions which influence the emissions recorded during the test mode,"" said a spokesman. The company's exhaust treatment systems are active whether on the test bench or on the road, he added. 

BMW also said that two studies carried out by the ICCT had shown that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW models complied with the legal requirements concerning nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emissions. ""We are not familiar with the test mentioned by Auto Bild concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 during a road test,"" BMW said. ""No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results. We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the test they carried out."" 

Representative of the ICCT weren't immediately available for comment. 

The new report comes after BMW received an early boost to its reputation amid the Volkswagen scandal. Researchers at West Virginia University, who led some of the research that focused US regulatory scrutiny on Volkswagen in the first place, compared BMW and Volkswagen diesel models in road tests in California. In those test, emissions from a BMW X5 sports utility vehicle matched or came in under what the vehicle produced in laboratory tests, the researchers said they found. But two Volkswagen models, a Jetta and a Passat, far exceeded emissions levels from lab testing.. BMW eDrive technology: Setting a new benchmark. The innovative BMW eDrive technology in the new 225xe and new 330e once again underlines BMW’s leading role in the premium segment when it comes to powertrain electrification. eDrive technology includes a number of cutting-edge plug-in hybrid components and makes a significant contribution to reducing fuel consumption and emissions. BMW eDrive is one of the most cutting-edge elements of the groundbreaking BMW EfficientDynamics suite of technology. 
 

 BMW eDrive – Locally emission-free driving  
Moreover, BMW eDrive technology ensures extremely dynamic acceleration off the line thanks to the instantaneous responses of the electric motor, which generates its remarkable torque from the word go. Plus, the eBoost function, which pools the torque of both drive systems under acceleration, serves up BMW’s signature driving pleasure, whatever the conditions. 
 Designed for different vehicle concepts  
The most important components of BMW eDrive technology are the synchronous electric motor (including the power electronics developed by BMW), the lithium-ion high-voltage battery and intelligent energy management. The latter ensures the electric motor and combustion engine in plug-in hybrid models work together as effectively as possible according to the situation at hand. 
 
Developed initially for the all-electric BMW i3 and BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car – which duly led the way in electric mobility in the premium sector – the modular structure of BMW eDrive technology sets it up perfectly for use in various vehicle concepts and segments. BMW uses its plentiful technical experience and customer feedback in the development of the latest BMW eDrive models. The fine-tuning of vehicle-specific elements, such as the battery cells, cooling management, power electronics and operating strategy, has involved the transfer of knowledge from the BMW i3 and BMW i8 to the development of new BMW eDrive models. Here, all components are adapted precisely to the vehicle at hand and optimised in terms of performance, efficiency, safety and durability. Moreover, BMW eDrive technology enables the electrified xDrive concept first featured in the BMW i8 to be executed with great efficiency. 
 BM W eDrive: familiar BMW character, flexible usage options  
BMW eDrive technology essentially spans the electric motor, the lithium-ion high-voltage battery and the power electronics. Based on a shared eBoost strategy, all BMW plug-in hybrid models offer supreme power delivery by bringing together their two drive systems, and elevate the responsiveness of BMW TwinPower Turbo technology to another new level. BMW eDrive makes all-electric driving in urban areas and over cross-country routes a marketable proposition. An important element of the operating strategy is the need-oriented use of externally sourced and recuperated electric energy to maximise the vehicle’s efficiency. The components of the eDrive architecture are tailored to each particular vehicle concept and can be combined with four- and three-cylinder petrol engines as well as with classical rear-wheel drive, xDrive or electrified all-wheel drive. 
 
The eDrive components developed as part of the BMW i projects will soon be integrated into other model ranges from the core brands. This scalable architecture also provides the platform required to offer plug-in hybrid vehicles at attractive prices on a par with those of conventionally powered variants of similar output. This means customers who opt for this advanced drive concept encounter not only the environmental benefits of electric mobility, but also economic plus-points. 
 Plug-in hybrid: energy management at its most intelligent  
In plug-in hybrid vehicles, intelligent energy management ensures the combustion engine and electric motor work together to maximum effect in all driving situations. Their operating strategy is based on the vehicle starting up on electric power only. BMW’s plug-in hybrid vehicles prioritise electric mode at low and moderate speeds, which allows them to exploit the benefits of the locally emission-free electric drive system. Under greater acceleration and at higher speeds, however, the combustion engine also joins the action. The boost function pools the torque of both drive systems to maximise the car’s dynamic performance and lend it remarkable poise and assurance.  eDrive ensures that the combustion engine runs efficiently (electric assist) at higher speeds as well. This allows a reduction in fuel consumption on brisk cross-country or motorway runs, for example. And when the route guidance function of the car’s navigation system is activated, the proactive function initiates an anticipatory operating strategy which optimises efficiency and maximises the electric driving experience. 
 
Like the BMW i8, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, BMW 330e and BMW 740e can all – at the touch of a button in MAX eDRIVE mode – run on purely electric power up to 120 km\/h, the BMW 225xe up to 125 km\/h. Here, the combustion engine only comes into play when the accelerator’s kickdown threshold is passed. In SAVE BATTERY mode the battery’s charge can be maintained to enable electric driving later on in the journey. If the charge level drops below 50 per cent, the battery is replenished. If the selector lever is moved into the S gate, the combustion engine starts up regardless of the mode engaged, ensuring sustained availability of the combined maximum output of the two drive systems. In addition, the battery’s charge is raised to 80 per cent. 
 
With the addition of the eDrive functions, the ECO PRO, COMFORT and SPORT driving experience modes are now even more clearly defined than on conventional vehicles. 
 Fast and convenient battery charging  
The high-voltage batteries of the new BMW plug-in hybrid models can be charged extremely easily, conveniently and quickly – both at home and while on the move – using  360° ELECTRIC solutions. The battery can be powered up again from a domestic socket using the standard charging cable supplied or from a BMW i Wallbox (charging power: 3.7 kW). When it comes to topping up the battery during a journey, the BMW i mobility service, ChargeNow, gives customers access to the world’s largest public charging network of over 30,000 charging points run by partners in 22 countries. 
 Higher performance, lower fuel consumption  
The new plug-in hybrid models with eDrive technology – such as the new X5 xDrive40e, the 225xe and 330e currently making their debuts, and the 740e due for launch in the near future – are once again setting the benchmark in the various corners of the premium segment when it comes to reducing fuel consumption, and will also meet the stipulations of international legislation in the future regarding CO2 emissions. Moreover, their all-electric and therefore locally emission-free driving mode will also allow them to drive into city centre zones where entry is regulated. And yet the BMW plug-in hybrid models also deliver the hallmark BMW attributes of dynamic excellence, sporting ability and driving pleasure while offering the best performance in their respective segments.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors looking to invest in German equities but stay clear of VW and the broader autos sector as an emissions-test cheating scandal rages will have to pay for the privilege. 

For those who prefer the economy of passive funds that merely track stock indexes, no product that excludes VW in particular or German motor manufacturers in general is currently available. 

The only option so far is to shift to an active fund run by managers who can buy or sell stock at any time, aiming to back winners and ditch losers. But these may charge retail clients as much as 1.5 percent of their assets a year for their services, compared with less than 0.1 percent for some funds which track blue-chip indexes. 

VW faces billions of dollars in fines and law suits after it admitted cheating to make its diesel cars appear cleaner. Since the scandal erupted on Friday, its share price has dived 33 percent and its chief executive has quit, leaving investors to wonder what will happen next. 

With investors fearing the scandal might spread, some may want to avoid entirely the three big German motor manufacturers, which collectively make up around 14 percent of the German blue-chip DAX index.. 

On top of the VW dive, BMW has lost around 15 percent and Daimler around 16 percent since Friday - despite denying they have manipulated emissions tests - helping to drag down the DAX. 

This fall has hit passive investors worse than those who paid more to a fund manager to pick winning bets actively. 

From the close on Sept. 17 to the close on Sept. 23, equity-focused exchange-traded funds with a focus on the DAX 30 lost around 6 percent, Lipper data showed, in line with the index. 

Of the $19 billion (£12.4 billion) invested in DAX equity ETFs, the bulk, $9.4 billion, is in BlackRock's iShares DAX fund. 

While most of the ETFs track the market-capitalisation weighted index of the underlying DAX, other ""smart beta"" products have been created to exclude certain sectors, focus on other investment factors such as a stock's cheapness or use leverage to boost returns. 

The biggest winners, though, were those ETFs which bet on the index falling. Such funds, collectively managing about $871 million, were up an average 10.5 percent between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23, data from Lipper showed. 

The biggest of them, db x-trackers ShortDax Daily UCITS ETF 1C, which manages $435 million but without using leverage, counted VW among its top-10 holdings and returned just over 6 percent during the period. 

BALL AND CHAIN? 

Any investors who fear VW's troubles could become a legal ball-and-chain dragging down its performance for years - like energy firm BP experienced after an explosion and oil leak at its Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010 - have access to no passive product that specifically excludes VW or autos. 

BlackRock, which is the world's biggest fund manager, said it had no plans yet to launch such a product, although index provider FTSE said it could create indexes that excluded VW or the autos sector, should investors demand it. 

New ETFs could be sold off the back of such an index, while if the scandal festers long enough, active funds could also seek to change their mandates to track it instead of the full DAX. 

At present, though, the nearest investors can get to a VW-free passive product is through a dividend-focused ETF which currently includes VW but would evict the stock if the company stopped paying. VW has set aside 6.5 billion euros (£4.7 billion) to cover the cost of recalling affected vehicles. 

One such fund is BlackRock's iShares DivDAX, which includes the 15 DAX stocks with the best dividend yield. 

""It is highly likely that a deteriorating fundamental outlook for VW, such as a missed dividend payment, will significantly cut VW exposure in smart beta ETFs,"" said Hector McNeil, co-CEO at ETF provider WisdomTree. 

While index trackers are forced to hold the carmakers in proportion to their 14 percent DAX weighting, the average for all Germany-focused funds was just 11.8 percent, and many active funds did not hold any of their stock. 

Of the $67 billion invested in Germany-focused active mutual funds, $41.4 billion is held in 116 equity funds, which collectively lost 4 percent between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23, Lipper data showed. 

Of those, just 22 funds managing a combined $6.2 billion had VW in their top-10 holdings. They fell 5.3 percent on average during the period.

In a follow-up to an earlier report in which German publication Auto Bild revealed that the BMW X3 xDrive20d model could be emitting up to 11 times the legal limit of nitrous oxide during tests conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the automaker has issued an update on the matter. 
 
It said that Auto Bild had published a clarification over its original article, which focused on the emissions of a BMW X3. “No evidence of emission manipulation by BMW. The values mentioned in the document were only generated in a single, one hour-long road test. Auto Bild has no access to the details of this test trail, which might explain the discrepancies to the test cycle NEDC (New European Driving Cycle),” the publication stated. 
 
As before, the automaker added that two studies carried out by the ICCT have confirmed that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW vehicles tested comply with the legal requirements concerning NOx emissions. No discrepancies were found in the X5 between laboratory-test and field-test NOx emissions. 
 
Damage from the initial article saw BMW stocks falling by as much as 9.7% following the surfacing of the AB report, according to Bloomberg. Separately, Daimler also saw its shares plummet by as much as 5.8% last week amidst growing concerns that it too could be involved in a similar situation.

Sensors have a widespread use in all type of automobiles right from two wheelers to heavy duty lorries. Some of the most common automotive application of sensors is found in wipers, lighting, dashboard, rain sensors, sunroof, parking, seat, climate, tilt alarm, tail gate release, tailgate close, trailer management, rear door, anti theft alarm, immobilizer and radio. With increasing popularities of vehicle automation and demand of concept cars around the globe, most of the research and development (R&D) attention of automotive industries is towards development of advanced automotive sensors such as MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors, wireless sensors and radar sensors. According to BMW (Germany based automobile company), 90% of the future car innovation will be focused on the advanced and efficient use of electronics in automotive., It is also evident in most recent development of automotive sensors technology such as “pre-emptive technology” and “Conti APIA” (integrated stability, collision avoidance, occupant protection). Sensors in automotive application such as emission control, battery control and occupant detection is witnessing escalating growth in recent years. 

Based on the application automotive sensors can be broadly categorised under powertrain vehicle security system, body electronics, safety and control, telematics and others. On the basis of technology the automotive sensors are broadly categorized as temperature sensors, pressure sensors, level\/position sensors, NOX sensor, speed sensors, MEMS sensors, magnetic sensors, oxygen sensor, inertial sensors and others. 

The automotive sensors are one of the fasted growing sectors in automotive industry with growth rate in double digit, especially in OEM (original equipment manufacturing) section. North America remains the largest market for automotive sensors market, followed by Europe and Asia Pacific. Germany leads the European market and China and Japan leads the Asia Pacific market. The growth is expected to be highest in Asia Pacific mainly attributed to growing economy of some of the other Asia Pacific’s nations such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines.

The continuous development in electronics sensors application and technology, the rising concern for safety, increasing demand of automation in automobiles, demand of concept cars from high income consumers and increasing use of sensors in hybrid semi hybrid and electric cars are boosting the demand of automotive sensors market. Lack of aftermarket for sensors is one of the chief restraints in the developing market of automotive sensors.

“The BMW group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests. We observe the legal requirements in each country and adhere to all local testing requirements,” it said in a statement after a report in the weekly Auto Bild claimed that emissions from one of its diesel cars exceeded European Union 

© 2015 AFP. BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE : Still the one?. YES, it is a bit prettier than before. at's what you wanted from a BMW 1 Series revision isn't it? Consider it delivered, the 1 Series now carrying a lot more of the 2, 3, and 4 Series about its front end. 

It's not as if being shaped like a shoe did the old 1 Series a great deal of damage in the sales department though. BMW has managed to shift nearly two million of the things since this car's original introduction nearly ten years ago. 
 
If you think of the 1 Series as a compact sports car that makes the million Mazda MX-5s sold in quarter of a century seem pretty small beer. 
 
is is an updated version of the second generation model that we rst saw in 2011. 
 
As we've said, the front end's now sleeker and in addition, BMW have also improved the level of standard equipment, developed new options and mobility services and improved eciency right across the board. 
 
INSIDE OUT As well as the usual quest to drive down emissions, BMW has also done its best to sneakily add a little more poke under the bonnet where possible. 
 
e 1 Series petrolengined range start with the 1.5-litre three cylinder 118i with 136PS and the 1.6-litre 120i with 170PS. 
 
en there's the 2.0-litre 218PS 125i, and at the top of the range is the ferocious little M135i, with a three-litre straight six that cranks out 326PS. Pedal this one hard and 62mph ashes by in just 4.9 seconds. 
 
e biggest change has come in the diesel range. e 1.5-litre three-cylinder engine in the improved BMW 116d generates 116PS and 270Nm of torque, an increase of 10Nm compared to its predecessor. 
 
e cabin is a good deal better looking than most rivals, with a revision to the dashboard minor controls. 
 
Both the air vents and the controls for the radio and the automatic air conditioning now feature chrome surrounds, while the radio and automatic air conditioning keypads are now set against highgloss black panelling. 
 
MORE THAN A FACELIFT No car manufacturer has made quite such impressive progress as BMW in the eld of improving e ciency. 
 
As well as Brake Energy Regeneration, electric power steering, the optimum gearshift indicator and the auto Start Stop function, standard equipment for the improved BMW 1 Series model range also includes ECO PRO mode, which can be activated using the included Driving Experience Control switch. 
 
Slowly but surely, BMW are excising each and every aw in the 1 Series' makeup. 
 
When the car was originally launched in rst generation form, it had plenty of aws. It wasn't good looking, interior packaging was awful, the cabin quality wasn't all that it could have been and it wasn't actually that exciting to drive. 
 
e second generation version corrected many of these faults and this improved version nesses the package still further. 
 
While it's still not the most elegant looking hatch on the market, it's no longer conspicuously weird-looking. You could even call the latest car handsome, which would be a rst for a 1 Series hatch. 
 
Where this generation scores is in building in so much value for the customer. e cabin looks and feels so much more aligned to more expensive BMW models and the engine range delivers so much more choice. 
 
One thing that hasn't changed is that the Munich maker continues to oer a balance between performance and economy that almost seems to defy the basic laws of thermodynamics. 
 
Expect this one to sell in serious numbers.

Bayerische Motoren Werke AG:Shares in BMW drop in mid-morning trade after a report that some of its diesel cars were found to exceed emissions standards - Reuters.German trade magazine Auto Bild says the BMW X3 xDrive 20d exceeded the Euro 6 limits on nitrogen oxide emissions more than 11-fold in road tests by the International Council on Clean Transportation - Reuters.Auto Bild cites BMW as saying: ""There is no function in BMWs for recognising exhaust cycles, and all exhaust systems remain active outside of exhaust cycles."" - Reuters.A spokesman for BMW tells Reuters he has nothing to add to the comments cited by Auto Bild - Reuters. . 2016 BMW X1 prices revealed. BMW has announced pricing and pictures of its second-generation X1, prior to the mini-SUV’s launch at September’s Frankfurt Motor Show. 
 
The rugged-looking crossover, which arrives in UK showrooms in the autumn, has been comprehensively re-engineered using the lighter, more versatile UKL platform already seen on BMW stablemates including the Gran Tourer. The chief benefits of this, plus a new, space-saving, transverse engine layout, are a longer roofline, shorter bonnet, improved safety protection, and more space for passengers and luggage. 
 
The fresh set-up also means that base, two-wheel-drive variants are front- instead of rear-wheel drive. A lighter 4WD system – with which most cars will be equipped – boosts economy and ability in the rough, as well as gets a 30 per cent reduction in torque losses. Dynamic traction and stability control plus cornering brake control are standard across the range. 
 
Rear multi-link suspension is matched with a MacPherson strut front end, and adjustable dampers can be teamed with optional Driver Experience Control. This provides a choice of Comfort and Sports suspension, as well as Sport, Comfort and Eco Pro driving modes. 
 
At launch, UK drivers will be offered a 2.0-litre petrol turbo in two degrees of tune, with the 228bhp, 258lb ft range-topping xDrive25i boasting 146mph and 0-62mph in 6.5sec. DERV fans can choose the 2.0 turbodiesel with three power outputs; the base sDrive18d features 148bhp and 243lb ft, which with a standard six-speed manual box and (along with the sDrive20i) front-wheel drive, should be good enough for 68.9mph and emissions of 114g\/km of CO2. All other X1s come with an eight-speed auto and 4WD. More engines, including a high-performance version and a hybrid, will be made available at a later date. 
 
Compared with the first-generation X1, the new five-seater is shorter, wider and taller, with a longer wheelbase. The resultant 85-litre bigger boot, improved rear kneeroom and higher-set seats giving better visibility out are all major packaging bonuses. 
 
The sDrive18d will cost from £26,780, while the xDrive25i is £36,060; a slight increase over the present model’s prices.. BMW denies rigging emissions tests after report on X3 exhaust.

 (Additional reporting by Sudip Kargupta; editing by David
Stamp). VW's Diesel Cheating Began With Cost-Cutting: Report. Good Morning! Welcome to The Morning Shift , your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Here are the important stories you need to know. 
 
1st Gear: And Bosch Warned Them About It 
 
Now that VW has admitted to cheating emissions on 11 million diesel cars worldwide , one of the biggest questions is “why?” Turns out, according to reports from German newspapers, that it began with cost-cutting measures implemented a decade ago. Via Automotive News : 
  
   
Bild am Sonntag said the roots of the crisis were planted in 2005 when then-VW brand chief Wolfgang Bernhard wanted VW to develop a new diesel engine for the U.S. market. Bernhard recruited Audi engineer Rudolf Krebs who developed a prototype that performed well in tests in South Africa in 2006, the paper said. 

Bernhard and Krebs argued that the only way to make the engine meet U.S. emission standards was to employ in the engine system an AdBlue urea solution used on larger diesel models such as the Passat and Touareg, according to the report. 

This would have added a cost of 300 euros ($335 in today’s U.S. dollars) per vehicle — a sum that VW finance officials said was too much at a time when a companywide cost-cutting exercise was under way. 
 
The second part of this is that supplier Bosch created the engine management software that allowed TDI engines to enter a “test” mode that cheated emissions, but warned VW back in 2007 that its use on production cars would be illegal: 
 
VW was also warned by one of its own engineers in 2011 about illegal emissions testing practices, a reportin the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung’s Sunday edition said, citing initial results of a VW internal investigation. 

Bild am Sonntag said Bosch supplied diesel software to VW for test purposes but it ended up in vehicles on the road. Bosch wrote to VW saying that such use was unlawful, according to the paper’s report, which did not cite sources. 
 
2nd Gear: Winterkorn Under Investigation 
 
And then there’s the criminal investigations into this mess, which will likely include several countries. VW CEO Martin Winterkorn may have resigned but he’s not out of the woods, according to The New York Times : 
 
German prosecutors said on Monday that they had begun an investigation of Martin Winterkorn, who until last week was the chief executive of Volkswagen, based on complaints from unidentified people that he should be held responsible for a widening scandal linked to diesel-emissions. 

The office of the state’s attorney in Braunschweig, a city close to Volkswagen’s base in Wolfsburg, said it had begun the investigation based on complaints filed by people it did not name. In Germany, any citizen can file a criminal complaint against another person, and the authorities are obligated to investigate. 
 
3rd Gear: CO2? C-Oh No 
 
Once again more groups say VW’s emissions cheating is, not surprisingly, the tip of the iceberg. Via Reuters : 
 
New European cars are spewing out on average 40 percent more carbon dioxide than laboratory tests show, an environmental campaign group said on Monday, saying Volkswagen’s rigging of emissions tests was only part of much wider cheating. 

[...] The new report from Transport & Environment (T&E), which works closely with the European Commission, said its data did not prove other carmakers were using such devices. 

But it said the gap between lab results and road performance had grown for emissions of carbon dioxide, as well as nitrogen oxides, to such an extent that further investigation was needed to discover what carmakers were doing to mask CO2 emissions. 
 
4th Gear: Who’s Overstating Fuel Economy Numbers? 
 
Remember when Hyundai got nailed hard for exaggerating their fuel economy claims? Another European group (they’ve been emboldened by VW lately, it seems) says Mercedes has the biggest gaps between stated numbers and real-world tests. Via Bloomberg : 
 
Mercedes-Benz topped a European lobbying group’s list of carmakers to overstate fuel economy for the second year in a row in an annual study that may receive extra scrutiny amid Volkswagen AG’s diesel-engine test scandal. 

Vehicles built by Daimler AG’s Mercedes division used 48 percent more fuel on average than their published statistics claim, with gaps exceeding 50 percent on new A-, C- and E-Class models, Brussels-based Transport & Environment said Monday. BMW’s 5-Series and the Peugeot 308 produced differences between real-world and laboratory results of just under 50 percent. Across the industry, the gap widened to 40 percent last year from 8 percent in 2001, with the difference between published specifications and actual fuel use costing a typical driver an additional 450 euros ($500) yearly at the pump. 
 
5th Gear: BMW May Face Recall Fine 
 
Compared to the emissions scandals, safety recalls feel so quaint, so 2014! But regulators say BMW may be in violation for not recalling Mini Coopers when they should have. From The Detroit News : 
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is opening an investigation into 30,456 2014-15 Mini Cooper, Cooper S and 2015 John Cooper Works after NHTSA performed side impact crash tests on two 2014 Mini Hardtop 2 Door Coopers more than a year ago. 

BMW didn’t recall the vehicle until July — and after months of pressure from NHTSA. 

“NHTSA is concerned that BMW was aware or should have been aware of the non-compliance with (side impact standards) and should have taken remedial action on the population of Mini Cooper vehicles identified in (July) earlier than it did. It appears from a review of NHTSA’s databases that BMW may have failed to submit recall communications to NHTSA in a timely manner,” NHTSA said.

Contact the author at patrick@jalopnik.com .. U.S. Stocks Fall; Caterpillar Weighs on Dow. U.S. stocks extended their selloff into a third straight session Thursday, dragged down by declines among big industrial firms and auto makers. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 195 points, or 1.2%, to 16085 in early afternoon trade. 

Shares of Caterpillar Inc. posted the biggest decline in the Dow after the maker of heavy equipment cut its revenue outlook and announced up to 10,000 job cuts as part of a cost-cutting plan. Shares fell 6.3%, knocking 28 points off the index. 

The S&P 500 lost 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2%. 

Investors sought shelter in assets perceived as safe, including U.S. government debt. Rising prices sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to its lowest level in nearly a month, recently falling to 2.098%. 

""When a bellwether like Caterpillar says something like that, it's going to take its toll on the sector for sure,"" said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird. ""There's a flight to things that aren't stocks."" Industrial companies in the S&P 500 fell 1.4%. 

The declines in the U.S. followed steep falls in Europe, where the scandal enveloping Volkswagen AG hit autos shares again. The Stoxx Europe 600 shed 2.1%. Germany's DAX declined 1.9% and France's CAC 40 fell 1.9%. 

BMW AG shares fell 5.2% in Frankfurt after a magazine reported that emissions of a model of the German car maker were higher than allowed under standardized testing conditions. BMW said it hasn't manipulated test results. 

Shares of U.S. auto makers also lost ground. General Motors Co. fell 1.6%, while Ford Motor Co. declined 1.3%. 

U.S. stocks have yet to bounce back meaningfully from a steep selloff that began in late August. Last week's announcement that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep interest rates near zero has failed to give shares a lift. The Dow is up 2.7% from its Aug. 25 low, but remains down 12% from its most recent record of 18312 reached in May. 

The Federal Reserve's decision last week to keep short-term interest rates near zero has failed to give stocks much of a lift. Many investors say the central bank's decision to stand pat instead affirmed worries that global growth was slowing. 

Investors remained cautious ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen later in the day at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, which could offer clues on the timing of a rise in rates. 

In economic news, initial jobless claims rose by 3,000 to 267,000 in the week ended Sept. 19, the Labor Department said Thursday, a level consistent with an improving labor market. Economists had expected 275,000 new claims. 

Orders for big-ticket items fell in August, a sign that the strong dollar and economic weakness overseas may be crimping demand for American goods. New orders for durable goods fell 2% in August from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists had expected orders to fall 2.5%. ""Investors' confidence is fragile. Markets are uncertain post the Fed decision,"" said James Barty, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 

In commodities, crude oil in New York rebounded from early losses, rising 0.7% to $44.76 a barrel. Gold futures gained 1.8% to $1,152.10 a troy ounce. 

Shares in Japan fell sharply as trading resumed after a three-day holiday. The Nikkei Stock Average closed down 2.8%, catching up with declines in global markets over recent sessions. China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.9% higher. 

The euro rose 0.5% against the dollar to trade around $1.1240, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Wednesday the central bank is ready to expand its quantitative easing program, but that there is no urgency to do so.

(END) Dow Jones Newswires. Green Car Congress: BMW to showcase 4 production plug-in hybrids at IAA in Frankfurt; new 225xe. BMW is using the upcoming IAA in Frankfurt to showcase four production BMW brand plug-in hybrid models from different vehicle segments—one newly announced. BMW eDrive is the new drive system technology used in all the electrically powered vehicles from BMW i and the plug-in hybrid models from BMW. Alongside BMW TwinPower Turbo technology for combustion engines, intelligent lightweight design and optimized aerodynamics, BMW eDrive technology is therefore one of the most important elements in the EfficientDynamics strategy designed to increase power and further reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

YARPP powered by AdBistro Powered by. Review: The Kulim-assembled BMW X6. Usually when BMW Malaysia decides to have a model come to our country Completely Knocked Down, it was the models that top the best seller’s list in our country. This is the first time BMW has decided to bring a rather niche model in to be locally assembled. 
 
Not much has changed in the CKD BMW X6, it still spots the extrovert design which blends the versatile character of all BMW X models while the interior still features exclusive trims and Dakota leather upholstery. The X6 also features a multifunctional instrument display with black-panel technology in the luxurious and comfortable cabin. 
 
The xDrive35i comes with the M Sport package that will give you electrically adjustable sport seats, an M steering wheel with multifunction buttons and paddle shifters as well as Sport gear lever. The exterior on the other hand comes with a number of M Sport decorations to mark the X6 with the M Sport Air Curtains, Air Breathers and air vents. 
 

 
A three-litre six-cylinder inline petrol engine powers the xDrive35i and will benefit from the full range of BMW EfficientDynamics. The engine generates a total of 306bhp and 400Nm of torque, this allows the Activity Coupe to make that century sprint in 6.4-seconds and to a top speed of 240kph. Even with impressive numbers like that, the average fuel consumption of the car reads at 8.6l\/100km and CO2 emissions level of 200g\/km thanks to the eight-speed Steptronic sport transmission. 
 
You get double wishbone suspensions on the front but the X6 benefits from the presence of the Adaptive M Suspension package that raises the Activity Coupe and combines with Dynamic Camper Control and pneumatic rear suspension for a sporty yet comfortable drive. 
 

 
BMW ConnectedDrive comes standard as like every BMW but the X6 M Sport comes complete with a Surround View 360 degree system that gives drivers perfect all-round visibility when navigating tight spaces. 
 
Make a pick from Alpine White, Flamenco Red, Carbon Black or Space Grey, with a range of Leather Dakota upholstery colour choices including Black, Coral Red and Cognac. The locally assembled BMW X6 xDrive35i M Sport comes to you now at RM666,888 on the road without insurance complete with a five-year unlimited mileage warranty and free scheduled service program. 
 

 
- car.astroawani.co. BMW denies report about emissions manipulations. Reuters  –  
BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW said it has not manipulated emissions tests, denying a magazine report saying some of its diesel cars were found to exceed emissions standards. 
 
""There is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on (test) rollers or on the road,"" the German luxury-car maker said on Thursday. 
 
German trade magazine Auto Bild said earlier on Thursday that BMW's X3 xDrive 20d model exceeded ""Euro 6"" emissions limits more than 11-fold in road tests by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). 
 
""No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results,"" BMW said. ""We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the test they carried out."" 
 
(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Kirsti Knolle). BMW denies manipulating or rigging diesel emission tests. AFP News  –  
German top-of-the-range carmaker BMW on Thursday denied suggestions in a newspaper report that it might have cheated in pollution tests on its diesel cars, as rival group VW has admitted to doing. 
 
""The BMW group does not manipulate or rig any emissions tests. We observe the legal requirements in each country and adhere to all local testing requirements,"" it said in a statement after a report in the weekly Auto Bild claimed that emissions from one of its diesel cars exceeded European Union norms by 11 times. 
 
The report had sent BMW's shares into a tailspin on the Frankfurt stock exchange, as investors feared that other manufacturers were also involved in the massive pollution scam at Volkswagen. 
 
According to Auto Bild, one of BMW's diesel cars produced dangerous gases that exceed EU anti-pollution limits. 
 
""Volkswagen is not the only carmaker whose cars produce high levels of nitrogen oxide,"" said the magazine, accusing certain vehicles of the BMW group of the same. 
 
It quoted road tests carried out by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) which found that BMW's X3 xDrive equipped with 20d diesel motors produce gas emissions that are 11 times higher than European limits. 
 
""All these data show that the problem is not specific to VW,"" Peter Mock from ICCT was quoted as saying. 
 
The ICCT had been at the origin of the stunning revelations of cheating by Volkswagen, which went public last Friday when the United States announced a probe. 
 
""When it comes to our vehicles, there is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on rollers (eg. test bench situation) or on the road,"" BMW said. 
 
""We are not familiar with the test mentioned by Auto Bild concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 during a road test. No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results,"" it said. 
 
""We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the test they carried out,"" the carmaker added. 
 
Investors appeared sceptical. 
 
After already falling nearly 10 percent earlier, the shares were still showing a loss of 6.7 percent after the company's denial.. BMW at the IAA Cars 2015 in Frankfurt. THE BMW stand at the 2015 International Motor Show in Frankfurt am Main revolves around the arrival of a new generation at the top end of the model line-up and the advent of a wide range of plug-in hybrid models for all 3 brands, which will be open to the public from Sept 19 to 27. 
 
The new BMW 7 Series underlines its claim to redefine what an exclusive, luxurious driving experience looks like in contemporary, pioneering form with an exceptional array of innovations. Key factors in enhancing dynamics, efficiency, comfort and safety while on the move are the use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) in the body structure, engines from the BMW Group’s new generation of power units, the plug-in hybrid system in the new BMW 740e, the Executive Drive Pro active chassis system, the Driving Experience Control switch with ADAPTIVE mode, and BMW Laserlight. 
 BMW 7 Series 
Maximising well-being in the interior, meanwhile, are the Executive Lounge feature with massage function, the illuminated Sky Lounge Panorama glass roof, just the right amount of accent lighting and a smartphone holder with inductive charging station. 
 
The new generation of the BMW 7 Series also boasts standout innovations when it comes to operating system and driver assistance technology. The various new features that are unprecedented in the luxury sedan segment include, for example, the extension of the iDrive system to include a touch display and BMW gesture control, Touch Command for controlling comfort and infotainment functions in the rear compartment, as well as a Remote Control Parking system. In addition to all this, BMW is also presenting the latest generation of the BMW Head-Up Display, Crossing traffic warning, the Steering and lane control assistant, active side collision protection and the Surround View system with 3D View and Panorama View in its new flagship model. 
 
The second generation of the BMW X1 successfully transfers the trademark qualities of a Sports Activity Vehicle to the compact segment with greater intensity than ever. The new edition of this highly popular model makes its mark with powerful proportions and clean lines in the style of its larger BMW X siblings. Inside, the new BMW X1 offers far more space for both passengers and luggage, a state-of-the-art premium ambience and sophisticated functionality. 
 BMW X1 
Petrol and diesel engines from the BMW Group’s latest generation of power units, an efficiency-optimised version of the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system and newly developed chassis technology combine to produce a notable increase in sportiness and ride comfort along with far greater efficiency. Equipment features available for the BMW X1 for the first time include full-LED headlights, Dynamic Damper Control, the BMW Head-Up Display that projects driving-related information onto the windscreen as in the larger BMW X models, as well as the Driving Assistant Plus system. 
 
Featuring a meticulously honed design on the outside, a painstakingly refined premium feel on the inside, a revised engine line-up, a more advanced chassis and additional equipment options, the new BMW 3 Series is perfectly poised to continue an unbroken run of success in the premium mid-size segment that first started four decades ago. The BMW brand’s most popular model range with over 14 million already sold to date once again sets new standards for dynamism, efficiency and design in both BMW 3 Series Sedan and BMW 3 Series Touring guise. 
 BMW 3 Series 
The choice of engines for the new BMW 3 Series comprises four petrol and seven diesel units at market launch. Depending on the particular engine variant, power is transferred via traditional rear-wheel drive or, alternatively, via the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system. The BMW 330e Sedan will furthermore be added to the line-up for the 2016 model year. This plug-in hybrid marries BMW eDrive technology with a four-cylinder petrol unit from the BMW Group’s newest engine generation. While extracting a total system output of 185 kW\/252 hp from its duo of power units, the BMW 330e returns average fuel consumption (combined) of 2.1–1.9 litres\/100 km (134.5–148.7 mpg imp) and CO2 emissions (combined) of 49–44 g\/km (in the EU test cycle). 
 BMW 3 Series 
The model range for the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is also set to be expanded by the arrival of a plug-in hybrid variant in spring 2016. The BMW 225xe serves up a brand new cocktail of BMW EfficientDynamics, comfort, fun at the wheel and all-wheel-drive performance. What’s more, this matchless driving experience is combined with impressive versatility and generous levels of space in a compact-sized vehicle. The space-saving location of the lithium-ion battery underneath the rear bench means that full use can continue to be made of the boot space above. 
 
The interaction between BMW eDrive technology and a 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology makes it possible to enjoy both all-electric driving and unrestricted motoring mobility in the BMW 225xe. With a maximum electric range of 41 kilometres, zero-local-emission driving can be experienced not just in the city, but beyond it too. 
 
Driving the rear wheels with the electric motor and the front wheels with the combustion engine’s power furthermore produces an electrified all-wheel-drive system that is quite unique in the BMW 225xe’s segment and promises outstanding traction in all weathers, especially in adverse conditions. The plug-in hybrid drive has an overall system output of 224hp. 
 
Average fuel consumption (combined) in the BMW 225xe is a frugal 2.1–2.0 litres\/100km, which equates to CO2 emissions (combined) of 49–46g\/km (in the EU test cycle). 
 
The introduction of BMW eDrive technology in BMW brand models opens up all-electric motoring with zero local emissions to new target groups. Coinciding with the world premiere of the new BMW 7 Series, the plug-in hybrid variant of the luxury sedan, the BMW 740e, is also being unveiled. The BMW 330e with plug-in hybrid drive is being added to the model line-up for the new BMW 3 Series. And it will also be possible to sample the pleasure of all-electric driving with zero local emissions in the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer in future – with the BMW 225xe. This means that, together with the soon-to-be-launched BMW X5 xDrive40e also on display at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, the BMW eDrive technology initially developed for BMW i cars will already be available for BMW models spanning four different vehicle segments in 2016. 
 
BMW Motorsport has chosen the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show as the setting for the world premiere of the new flagship model in the BMW customer racing range: the BMW M6 GT3 has been built for endurance racing and will make its debut on the starting grid in the 2016 season. The racing car designed on the basis of the BMW M6 Coupe is powered by a V8 engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology that has only undergone minor modifications for competition and comes with an aerodynamically optimised chassis. Crash structures and an outer skin made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) help to keep the overall vehicle weight below 1,300 kilograms. 
 
Besides the BMW M6 GT3, BMW M GmbH is also showcasing its latest range-topping model offering the ultimate in dynamic, road-going performance at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. The new BMW M6 Competition Edition underlines its status as a yet more individual version of the high-performance coupe with a choice of special exterior paint finishes, components manufactured from high-tech CFRP, exclusive leather upholstery with coordinated contrast stitching, and more distinctive touches besides. The new special edition model is available exclusively in the guise of the BMW M6 Coupe in conjunction with the Competition Package that has been geared for supreme performance. This gives the 4.4-litre V8 petrol engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology an output of 441 kW\/600 hp and a peak torque of 700 Nm (516 lb-ft), and when combined with the optional Driver’s Package allows the BMW M6 Coupe to reach a top speed of 305 km\/h (190 mph). 
 
BMW makes systematic and successful use of cutting-edge lighting technology in order to increase safety when driving in the dark and to mould a signature brand look. The latest innovations in this field are being presented at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. Following on from their world premiere in the BMW i8, the exceptionally powerful BMW Laserlight headlights with anti-dazzle High Beam Assistant are now being made available for the new BMW 7 Series too. The development of lighting technology for the interior of BMW models and the immediate surrounding area never stops advancing either. In the new BMW 7 Series range, a precisely configured lighting design adds to the cabin’s exclusive feel. 
 
BMW has translated the latest advances in the field of intelligent connectivity into a further increase in the wealth of driver assistance systems and applications that enhance comfort and safety. The latest additions to the BMW ConnectedDrive portfolio include the new BMW ConnectedDrive App, the BMW Remote Cockpit, the super-fast WiFi hotspot, automatic navigation map updates, smart home integration, as well as Remote Control Parking and other highly sophisticated driver assistance systems making their debut in the new BMW 7 Series 
 
Following the successful global launch of the purely electrically powered BMW i3 (energy consumption combined: 12.9 kWh; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g\/km) and the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car (fuel consumption combined: 2.1 l\/100 km \/ 134.5 mpg imp; CO2 emissions combined: 49 g\/km) the BMW i brand is now further cementing its status as a trailblazer for sustainable mobility with a growing variety of vehicle and mobility services. BMW i is already the brand to have won most awards during its introductory phase in the history of motoring. The inclusion of the BMW i3 in the model fleets of the premium car-sharing service, DriveNow, in the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark now offers the wider public an easy, low-cost way of trying out electric mobility for the first time. At the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, BMW i is additionally presenting the complete range of technological concepts that are ideal for everyday charging at home and in the public domain. The most recent innovation is BMW i Light and Charge – a street light from which the high-voltage battery in an electric car can also be recharged. 
 
BMW i is providing further impetus by transferring technology to current BMW brand models. All the plug-in hybrid models being exhibited by BMW at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, for instance, employ the BMW eDrive technology initially developed for BMW i cars in the form of electric motors, power electronics, high-voltage batteries and intelligent energy management. Equally, the experience with using industrially manufactured CFRP garnered during development of the BMW i cars has now helped to reduce the weight of the new BMW 7 Series luxury sedans.. BMW M6 Coupe Competition Edition.. WOODCLIFF LAKE, NJ. - September 16, 2015 - (Motor Sports Newswire) -  Today, BMW M GmbH presented the exclusive BMW M6 Competition Edition at the 66th Frankfurt International Motor Show (IAA). The 2016 Competition Edition stands for exceptional individuality, paintwork colors, BMW Individual components made of high-tech carbon fiber, fine leathers with coordinated contrast stitching and a range of unusual details. Limited to 100 units in the US, the Competition Edition is available exclusively for the BMW M6 Coupe with the further honed Competition Package and with a BMW M Performance Driving Center Experience Voucher.



The 2016 Competition Package has also been released for three model variants: 2016 BMW M6 Coupe, BMW M6 Grand Coupe and the BMW M6 Convertible.

Defined by outstanding performance, the three model variants are powered by a 4.4 liter V8 BMW M TwinPower Turbo technology producing 600 bHP with a power boost increasing peak torque from 500 lb-ft to 516 lb-ft delivered between an extremely wide rev band of 1,500 and 6,000 rpm. The increased power, dynamics and handling is owed to the same principles applied to BMW M vehicles: the chassis technology is tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the powertrain. Firmer tuning of the springs, dampers and anti-roll bars increase stability, reduce roll and result in a higher level of steering precision.



The BMW M6 Coupe Competition Edition model comes with a choice of two exterior paintwork colors: dazzling Alpine White and luminous Austin Yellow metallic. In Alpine White, the BMW M6 Coupe Competition Edition features striking decorative bodywork stripes in the trademark BMW M colors, as will also be displayed on the new BMW M6 GT3 race car. Forming an attractive contrast, customers can choose between 20-inch light alloy Double Spoke M wheels with performance tires and 20-inch light alloy Double Spoke M wheels with forged black with performance tires. An M Performance Exhaust with carbon fiber tailpipes compliments the sportier design. Along with the BMW kidney grille, door handles and side gills in black chrome and the carbon-fiber exterior mirror caps, they accentuate the extraordinarily sporty and powerful presence of the car. The carbon-fiber M rear spoiler and rear diffuser optimize airflow for increased dynamics.

In the interior, BMW Individual fine-grain Merino full leather in black with contrast stitching – available in Opal White with Alpine White paintwork and in Yellow with Austin Yellow metallic paintwork – highlights the car’s exclusive sporty ambience. “M6 Competition” lettering in metal on the door sills and in the side gill elements, along with the lettering on the cupholder lids, is a further signature feature of the Edition model. The interior trim strips, gear selector and M sports steering wheel spokes are made from fine, lightweight carbon fiber, while the steering wheel rim is lined with elegant Alcantara leather.

M multifunction seats for the driver and front passenger, the BMW Head-Up Display and Harman Kardon Surround Sound System or High-End Surround Sound System by Bang & Olufsen with 16 speakers and output of 1,200 watts are also part of the equipment range.

To experience the special BMW M vehicle performance dynamics on the track, M6 Competition Edition customers will receive a Performance Center Voucher upon delivery. The coupon provides each owner with a special opportunity to visit the BMW Performance Center Driving School of their liking for an exclusive half-day instructor led driving experience.

Limited to 120 units worldwide and 100 in the U.S., the BMW M6 Competition Edition is available at selected retailers for $164,900 plus Destination and Handling. For more information please contact your local dealer.

2,chevrolet,"Cars We Remember: 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3. Q: Hi, Greg. First I want to tell you I enjoy your articles on the older cars and your auto experiences. I still have my 1974 Chevy Malibu Laguna Type S-3 that I bought brand new from the  Ferrario Chevrolet dealership in Wysox, Pennsylvania, back in 1974. I am hoping you can give me some history on this car and its current value. The car is original with 52,000 miles on it. It has the 350 V-8 engine with an automatic transmission. I need to buy some parts for the car that I can’t seem to find. I need rear bumper filler in white and also rubber bumper guards as they are cracking and falling apart.  Thanks very much, Bob Best, Canton, Pennsylvania. A: Bob, thank you very much for your handwritten letter and the kind words. Your Laguna S-3 was produced from 1974 to 1976 on GM’s new Colonnade A-Body platform assembly line, which was also responsible for many of the sibling mid-size Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Buicks back then. Your car looks to be an exceptional example of an original 1974 Laguna S-3 where 350, 400 and 454-inch engines still found a home. All engines in 1974 had to adapt to the new smog and unleaded gasoline requirements, effectively lowering compression ratios which resulted in big horsepower losses. Still, your 350 V-8 powered Laguna is quite the attractive car and is one that is getting even rarer for several reasons. First, the 1974 Laguna S-3 was not a big seller that year. Laguna models were expensive as they were sharing much of the interior influences with the Chevy Monte Carlo. This non-robust lack of sales for V-8 and performance cars back then resulted in a new “consumer code” that pointed to small cars and fuel economy. Thus the mid-size Laguna was not a top choice by any means even though its sibling Chevelle Malibu sold well in six-cylinder and smaller V-8 trim. The good news for a car collector is production numbers, or, better yet, lack thereof.  Of the 312,265 Chevelle Malibu sedans and coupes produced in 1974, only 15,792 were option E37, specifically the new Laguna S-3 V-8 that carried a base price of $3,723. Additionally, it was the Laguna S-3 that replaced the famed Chevelle SS in the Chevy lineup, offering a sleek new body design and those body colored bumpers you now seek. (See the owner’s photo attached.) The second reason for being a rare collector car is plain old attrition. Many Chevelles and Malibus and all other A Body creations ended up at the scrap yard long before muscle cars became popular in the hobby. Personally, I always felt the Laguna S-3 was a great looking car, and because of its aerodynamic design back then, including the slope nose front end models in 1975 and 1976, the S-3 became the car of choice for many top NASCAR teams thanks to its slipstreaming properties at 200 mph. However, NASCAR was hot off eliminating from competition other aerodynamic cars like the 1970 Plymouth Superbird and the Mercury Talladega models, so after the 1976 season they outlaw the slope nose Laguna from further competition. Page 2 of 2 - Overall, GM’s new Colonnade A Body Platform was not too much different than the previous A Body platforms that dated back in 1962. Further, if you look close at the 1966 to 1972 A-Body cars you’ll find the design may have changed quite a bit but the drivetrain did not, minus the lower compression engines. Still, even in a time of corporate crisis in building new small cars, it was the 1974 to 1976 Laguna that featured upgrades in larger disc brakes and a new coil over spring rear suspension setup instead of the solid rear axle. As for current pricing, I’m sad to say the 1974 to 1976 Laguna S-3 will never be what a Chevelle SS454 is today. Current NADA Classic Car values have a 1974 Laguna Type S-3 with a 350 V-8 in at $7,650 in “high retail” condition, to an “average retail” of $4,140. I personally feel a Laguna S-3 350 is worth a bit more, and perhaps in the coming years it will increase in value due to its low production numbers. The Laguna 454 with a 4-speed? It’s at around $10,000 in NADA “high retail” condition, compared to a 1970 Chevelle SS454 with the LS6 engine that lists for a “high retail” of $159,000 from an original retail of $3,222! Prices like this prove you can’t erase what happened to muscle cars when the gas crisis hit and  manufacturers went to unleaded gas, smog\/emission controls and low compression engines. It just plain killed the collector value of cars from the mid to late 1970 decade. In ending, to find the parts you need I recommend picking up a copy of Auto Round-Up or Hemmings Motor News that cater to the collector car hobby. There are also hundreds of online businesses that cater to restoration of Chevrolet cars and trucks specifically, so if you have a friend or family member with a computer, check it out, and look at eBay too.

VW controversy a further knock on diesels. Nearly a quarter of VW-brand sales are diesel-powered in America, where the technology is often perceived as dirty despite its efficiency. (Photo: Scott Olson \/ ) 

Volkswagen AG’s emissions-cheating scandal has implications that extend well beyond the German automaker and its 11 million affected vehicles. 

The admission that Europe’s largest automaker cheated on pollution tests for its diesel vehicles could mean trouble for the already struggling technology in the United States. 

Analysts say customers may be turned off on diesels after the revelation that VW’s engines pumped out 40 times the allowable smog-forming pollution. And that could lead to a rise in hybrid and electric vehicle production as automakers work to reach strict federal fuel regulations by the middle of next decade. 

“You tend to see tipping points, and there’s a very strong possibility this is one for the technology here in the U.S. and opening the door to electric vehicles and hybrids globally,” said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for LMC Automotive. “I think this situation does have the possibility certainly of putting another doubt in the consumers’ minds about diesels from an acceptance standpoint.” 

For years, American car buyers largely have shunned diesel cars because of a perception they are dirty, despite their efficiency. Diesel fuel prices until recently have largely remained high, further deterring the public and automakers. 

Only 3.4 percent of cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. in 2014 were diesel-powered, and VW provided over 20 percent of them, according to LMC. 

By comparison, Europeans have embraced diesels, in large part because of cheaper diesel fuel prices overseas. LMC says diesels account for about half the cars sold there, but the VW scandal could signal a rise in alternative options, Schuster said. 

“It’s not just a U.S. situation,” he said. “There’s certainly possibilities this could be a catalyst for opening the door for electric and hybrid technology.” 

VW has staked much of its compliance strategy with U.S. fuel efficiency rules with diesels. Nearly a quarter of VW-brand sales here are diesel-powered. 

“You’re getting over 40 miles a gallon from a diesel with a 54.5 mpg average due by 2025, it seemed to be a good path to that number,” said Kelley Blue Book managing editor Matt DeLorenzo. “Now they’re paying the price.” 

Detroit automakers have largely stayed away from diesel powerplants in passenger vehicles. 

Ford Motor Co. only offers the option on its heavy-duty trucks, Super Duty pickups and Transit vans. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sells diesel versions of its heavy-duty trucks, Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee. 

General Motors Co. is launching its 2016 Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon diesel midsize pickups. The company also has diesel versions of its heavy-duty GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado, and of the Chevrolet Express, Cruze and GMC Savana full-size vans. 

GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said Tuesday that all of the company’s diesel variants are emissions-compliant. He said the company doesn’t foresee the VW issue “having any impact on our current vehicles.” 

José Muñoz, executive vice president of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. and chairman of Nissan North America, said Tuesday that other green vehicle technologies could see a slight boost following Volkswagen’s diesel emissions issue. 

“What may or may not happen we don’t know,” Muñoz said. “Our strategy for this market … has always been gasoline. We want to focus on the EV technology that we believe we have the right technology. We have taken a lead on this.” 

A spokesman for the Diesel Technology Forum, a Washington, D.C.-area nonprofit that advocates diesel technology, said Tuesday it would not comment directly on the VW case, but still believes clean diesel technology has a role for automakers in the U.S. 

“The new generation of diesel cars does provide a significant benefit to reducing CO2 emissions, improving fuel economy as well as lowering emissions of other pollutants,” said Allen Schaeffer, the organization’s executive director. “We see diesel as an important solution for manufacturers working to meet future fuel economy requirements.” 

Schaeffer said there were 39 passenger car models available for sale in the U.S. today, and he expects that number to jump to 54 by the end of 2016, although he did expect the VW news will have a yet-to-be-seen impact. 

“We’re pretty confident the trajectory for clean diesel in the U.S. is going to continue in the upward direction,” he said.

Southfield, Michigan, September 15, 2015.Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the MOOG ® Steering and Suspension-equipped No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS captured their 12 th top-five finish of the year in Saturday's Federated Auto Parts 400 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup event at Richmond (Va.) International Raceway. Perhaps the biggest news for the Hendrick Motorsports-owned team, however, was that crew chief Greg Ives earned his fourth MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award, giving him the lead in the battle for $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" honors. 
    
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Problem Solver of the Year award goes to the crew chief with the most weekly MOOG award wins throughout the 36-race Sprint Cup season. Ives earned Saturday's weekly award after the 88 car improved by a race-best 0.154-second-per-lap to finish fifth. 
 
After starting in 29 th position, the 88 car moved into the top 15 within the first 110 laps. Earnhardt cracked the top 10 just 24 laps later and remained among the lead pack for much of the rest of the night. He advanced to seventh with just over 100 laps remaining and to fifth position on Lap 314 (of 400). The 88 briefly fell back one position but ran strong during the final 18-lap green-flag run to secure a top-five finish. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
 
Earnhardt and Ives, like 15 other sets of Cup drivers and crew chiefs, now prepare for the Challenger Round of the Chase, which begins Sunday at Chicagoland Speedway. The 88 team holds the sixth seed in the field of 16 Chase qualifiers. 
 
""Dale Junior and Greg ran a smart race, knowing they had a Chase spot sewn up but still wanting to head into the Challenger Round with a strong finish,"" said Tim Nelson, director of Motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""A top five gives them something positive to build on for next week, and now Greg has even more at stake as the leader in our year-end Problem Solver award standings."" 
 
With four weekly MOOG awards, Ives now holds a one-win lead over rookie crew chief Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly award through the first 26 Cup races. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

Mahindra TUV300 to get Micro Hybrid tech. The TUV300 will also feature the new Eco Mode. The compact SUV will be equipped with an AMT gearbox.

Mahindra is all set to launch its first grounds-up compact SUV, the TUV300 on September 10, 2015. Bookings for the new SUV have already commenced with dealers promising deliveries around September 17, right in time for the Ganesh festival. 
 
The TUV300 is the second compact SUV from the carmaker, the first being the Mahindra Quanto. Spy pictures of the undisguised TUV300 have been seen on the internet, and it clearly shows the SUV’s angular and upright design. On the inside, the TUV300 gets a 5+2 layout with two jump seats behind the second row. The interior will get dual-tone upholstery and a number of creature comforts and safety features depending on variant. Sources tell us that ABS and dual front airbags will be offered as an option, even on base trims of the compact SUV.  
 
As a method to keep costs low, Mahindra TUV300 will share a lot of parts with other offerings from the manufacturer, both on the body and under the skin to keep costs in check. Dealers tell us that it will also feature the Micro Hybrid technology available on various Mahindra products like the Scorpio. This means the TUV300 will get the start-stop option that helps save fuel and reduce emissions. This system will allow the engine to shut off completely when the vehicle comes to a halt, for example at traffic signals. The engine comes to life again once the driver presses the clutch. The TUV300 will be the first compact SUV to feature this fuel-saving technology.  
 
The TUV300 is also likely to come with a new Eco Mode. This feature is expected to be similar to the one seen on other newly launched vehicles like the Tata Zest. When active, the mode balances engine power for driving and AC usage and helps deliver optimum fuel economy.   
 
The Mahindra TUV300 will be powered by the new mHawk80 1.5-litre diesel engine, expected to be a revised version of the 1.5-litre three-cylinder unit seen on the Quanto. We expect Mahindra to price the base variant of the TUV300 at around Rs 7.3 lakh (ex-showroom).

However, NASCAR was hot off eliminating from competition other aerodynamic cars like the 1970 Plymouth Superbird and the Mercury Talladega models, so after the 1976 season they outlaw the slope nose Laguna from further competition.

Further, if you look close at the 1966 to 1972 A-Body cars you’ll find the design may have changed quite a bit but the drivetrain did not, minus the lower compression engines. Still, even in a time of corporate crisis in building new small cars, it was the 1974 to 1976 Laguna that featured upgrades in larger disc brakes and a new coil over spring rear suspension setup instead of the solid rear axle. As for current pricing, I’m sad to say the 1974 to 1976 Laguna S-3 will never be what a Chevelle SS454 is today. Current NADA Classic Car values have a 1974 Laguna Type S-3 with a 350 V-8 in at $7,650 in “high retail” condition, to an “average retail” of $4,140. I personally feel a Laguna S-3 350 is worth a bit more, and perhaps in the coming years it will increase in value due to its low production numbers. The Laguna 454 with a 4-speed? It’s at around $10,000 in NADA “high retail” condition, compared to a 1970 Chevelle SS454 with the LS6 engine that lists for a “high retail” of $159,000 from an original retail of $3,222! Prices like this prove you can’t erase what happened to muscle cars when the gas crisis hit and  manufacturers went to unleaded gas, smog\/emission controls and low compression engines. It just plain killed the collector value of cars from the mid to late 1970 decade.

Exclusive - GM to tap into connectivity, expand car sharing services: CEO (Reuters). General Motors CEO Mary Barra presents the new Opel Astra during the media day at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach  
By Joseph White 

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra said the automaker plans new efforts to capitalise on the connectivity built into its cars, expanding car sharing services, offering more autonomous driving features and enabling services through smartphone apps. 

""Our goal is to disrupt ourselves, and own the customer relationship beyond the car,"" Barra told Reuters in an interview Monday ahead of a meeting with investors and analysts scheduled for Oct. 1. 

Using technology embedded in its cars, she said, a customer who owns a Chevrolet Malibu could step into a Cadillac CTS and the luxury car could import from a smartphone app the driver’s preferences for how the car should function. 

It would be ""a hop, skip and a jump"" for GM to offer broader car sharing services, she said. GM’s autonomous driving feature, SuperCruise, will also make use of high-speed data connections in cars when it launches next year. 

Connectivity and apps will also help GM keep tabs on what customers are doing with their cars and how they are responding to features such as automatic braking or hands-free highway driving, Barra said. Companies such as Apple Inc and Google Inc are pushing to dominate dashboard displays with their software, but ""we have the platform"" of the vehicle itself,  Barra said. 

GM has moved more aggressively than most of its rivals to put high-speed, 4G LTE data connections in its cars. 

""We sold more 4G LTE connected vehicles in three days in June than the rest of the industry did in the first half of the year,"" Phil Abram, GM’s executive director for connectivity said in a separate interview 

GM forecasts that from 2014 to 2018 it will earn about $350 million before interest and taxes on connectivity related services – a rounding error on GM’s projected revenue. Barra said the value in connectivity will grow if GM can inspire customers to stick with its brands for life, and provide data GM can use to tailor features and services. 

GM and many of its established rivals, including Ford Motor Co , BMW AG, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG are under pressure to demonstrate they will not be left in the dust as companies with roots in the digital technology industry, including Apple and search giant Google Inc, electric car pioneer Tesla Motors Inc and ride-sharing power Uber try to reinvent transportation. 

The threat from Silicon Valley, concern about rising regulatory costs in the wake of Volkswagen AG emissions scandal and economic uncertainty in China have combined to drive most auto stocks into the ditch this year. GM’s shares traded Monday about 12 percent below their $33 per share initial public offering price – despite Barra’s promise earlier this year to return $10 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends through 2016. 

Barra gets good marks from analysts and investors for delivering on the automaker’s profit targets so far – including maintaining a forecast of 9 to 10 percent profit margins in China despite rapidly decelerating growth in vehicle demand.  Earlier this month, GM paid $900 million to settle a criminal probe of mishandled recalls, dispelling a dark cloud on its horizon. 

Barra in the interview confirmed earlier forecasts of 9 to 10 percent profit margins in China, breaking even in Europe next year and completing the $5 billion in share buybacks by the end of next year. 

""We think the market is not fairly valuing the progress GM has made,"" said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. While he welcomed GM’s initiatives on autonomous driving and disruptive mobility, ""we’re not sure that will move the needle on the stock price."" 

(Reporting By Joseph White and Paul Lienert; Editing by Bernard Orr). U.S. Charges GM with Wire Fraud, Concealing Facts on Ignition Switch. General Motors Co. admitted to criminal wrongdoing and agreed to pay a lower-than-expected financial penalty in the mishandling of a defective ignition switch, closing one chapter on a safety crisis that dented the auto maker’s finances and reputation. 
 
GM will pay $900 million to settle the U.S. Justice Department case, which charged GM with wire fraud and scheming to conceal a deadly safety defect from U.S. regulators, according to a criminal information filed by federal prosecutors. 
 
The company entered a deferred prosecution agreement, under which the government will seek to dismiss the case in three years if GM abides by the deal’s terms. An independent monitor will audit GM’s safety practices for as many as four years as part of the settlement. No individuals were charged. 
 
Thursday afternoon, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called the case one of “life and death” and described as “searing” meetings he held with ignition-switch victims. GM “didn’t tell the truth in the way they should have to their regulator and to the public,” he said. 
 
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan approved the deal during a hearing later Thursday in Manhattan federal court. Judge Nathan said she read the “heartbreaking” accounts of deaths caused by the defects in documents prosecutors submitted. 
 
“If there’s any doubt to the criminality of the conduct, that doubt is put to rest today,” Judge Nathan said. 
 
The settlement caps a tumultuous period for GM, which many analysts expected to face stiffer penalties from prosecutors. In the end, the largest U.S. auto maker by sales avoided the corporate stain of a guilty plea and accepted a financial penalty less than the $1.2 billion Toyota Motor Corp. agreed to last year in a similar settlement addressing unintended acceleration issues in vehicles. 
 
With much of the uncertainty from the criminal probe removed, GM can focus more on falling sales in China, increasingly stringent emissions standards and a technological arms race enveloping all car makers. Chief Executive Mary Barra’s first year at the helm of GM was consumed by the ignition-switch defect, leading to widespread safety reforms that prompted record recalls exceeding 26 million vehicles. 
 
“People were hurt and people died in our cars. That’s why we’re here today,” Ms. Barra said during an address to employees Thursday. She called the criminal settlement a “tough agreement” and pointed to a victims compensation fund and program encouraging employees to speak up about safety problems as evidence the auto maker had reformed. 
 
But GM received a lower-than-expected financial penalty, and no individual employees yet face criminal charges. Fitch Ratings, which had predicted a financial penalty possibly exceeding $2 billion, said the settlement was a positive development that removed uncertainty for GM. It left the company’s credit rating unchanged. 
 
GM separately Thursday said it planned to take a $575 million charge in the third quarter for settling nearly 1,400 lawsuits arising from the defective switch. 
 
The twin settlements of the criminal case and outstanding ignition-switch lawsuits “clearly puts it behind them at roughly a cash-cost range we were anticipating,” said Brian Johnson, a Barclays PLC analyst. He said the criminal settlement allows Ms. Barra to “get back to the business of running the company” and focus on trying to break even in Europe, increase margins at home and deal with China’s slowing economy. 
 
GM shares remained little changed in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday. 
 
Still, the government’s criminal case detailed prolonged efforts by the auto maker to conceal a deadly safety lapse from government officials and mislead consumers. In 57 pages of court documents, prosecutors alleged GM took the ignition-switch problem “offline” and “outside the normal recall process” in spring 2012 amid concerns disclosures would hurt the company. 
 
GM for more than a decade failed to recall millions of vehicles equipped with the switch, which is now linked to 124 deaths. The switch can slip out of the run position, disabling safety features including air bags, power steering and power brakes. GM’s mishandling of the safety defect prompted congressional hearings, record recalls and increased regulatory scrutiny. 
 
The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office, which investigated GM with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New York field office, cited the auto maker’s cooperation in determining the financial penalty. In addition, prosecutors credited GM for launching an internal investigation, firing employees and establishing a compensation fund that could end up paying victims up to $625 million. 
 
The government is likely to face criticism for the lower financial penalty and for not charging executives or other employees. Justice Department officials last week issued a memo codifying policies announced in 2014 aimed at prioritizing investigating company employees before seeking financial settlements. 
 
Laura Christian, whose daughter died in a 2005 crash of a Chevrolet Cobalt equipped with the faulty switch, said “monetary fines are grossly inadequate and will never serve as a serious deterrent to corporations.” But, she added “jail time will.” 
 
Mr. Bharara on Thursday said the government faced legal challenges in charging individuals, but stopped short of calling the investigation closed. Prosecutors’ difficulties stem in part from limitations with federal law that calls for civil fines but forecloses criminal penalties when an auto maker fails to alert regulators to a safety defect in a timely manner, people familiar with the matter have said. 
 
The settlement in any event ratchets up an unprecedented government crackdown on auto makers, tracing back to Mr. Bharara’s case against Toyota. In addition to the GM case, federal prosecutors in Detroit are probing Takata Corp. over the Japanese company’s handling of rupture-prone air bags so far linked to eight deaths and more than 100 injuries. 
 
Ms. Barra and other GM employees still face depositions in litigation consolidated in a New York federal court, and other probes. Outside lawyer Kenneth Feinberg is still finalizing payouts to victims applying to the auto maker’s compensation fund. GM must undergo continued auditing of safety practices both from the Justice Department and regulators. 
 
GM knew of the ignition switch’s problems as early as 2002, according to court papers, but approved production anyway. A former GM engineer failed to alert others to changing the design of the switch in 2006 after numerous complaints. 
 
By 2012, GM employees, including the company’s safety director and safety attorney, knew of deaths and serious injuries in crashes where air bags failed to deploy involving the defective switch, court documents said. 
 
“The worst part about this tragedy is that it was entirely avoidable,” said Christy Goldsmith Romero, the special inspector general for the government’s troubled asset relief program that aided auto makers during the financial crisis. “GM could have significantly reduced the risk of this deadly defect by improving the key design for the less than $1 per vehicle.”

How to Win a Real-Estate Bidding War. Cars We Remember: 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3. Q: Hi, Greg. First I want to tell you I enjoy your articles on the older cars and your auto experiences. I still have my 1974 Chevy Malibu Laguna Type S-3 that I bought brand new from the  Ferrario Chevrolet dealership in Wysox, Pennsylvania, back in 1974. I am hoping you can give me some history on this car and its current value. The car is original with 52,000 miles on it. It has the 350 V-8 engine with an automatic transmission. I need to buy some parts for the car that I can’t seem to find. I need rear bumper filler in white and also rubber bumper guards as they are cracking and falling apart.  Thanks very much, Bob Best, Canton, Pennsylvania. A: Bob, thank you very much for your handwritten letter and the kind words. Your Laguna S-3 was produced from 1974 to 1976 on GM’s new Colonnade A-Body platform assembly line, which was also responsible for many of the sibling mid-size Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Buicks back then. Your car looks to be an exceptional example of an original 1974 Laguna S-3 where 350, 400 and 454-inch engines still found a home. All engines in 1974 had to adapt to the new smog and unleaded gasoline requirements, effectively lowering compression ratios which resulted in big horsepower losses. Still, your 350 V-8 powered Laguna is quite the attractive car and is one that is getting even rarer for several reasons. First, the 1974 Laguna S-3 was not a big seller that year. Laguna models were expensive as they were sharing much of the interior influences with the Chevy Monte Carlo. This non-robust lack of sales for V-8 and performance cars back then resulted in a new “consumer code” that pointed to small cars and fuel economy. Thus the mid-size Laguna was not a top choice by any means even though its sibling Chevelle Malibu sold well in six-cylinder and smaller V-8 trim. The good news for a car collector is production numbers, or, better yet, lack thereof.  Of the 312,265 Chevelle Malibu sedans and coupes produced in 1974, only 15,792 were option E37, specifically the new Laguna S-3 V-8 that carried a base price of $3,723. Additionally, it was the Laguna S-3 that replaced the famed Chevelle SS in the Chevy lineup, offering a sleek new body design and those body colored bumpers you now seek. (See the owner’s photo attached.) The second reason for being a rare collector car is plain old attrition. Many Chevelles and Malibus and all other A Body creations ended up at the scrap yard long before muscle cars became popular in the hobby. Personally, I always felt the Laguna S-3 was a great looking car, and because of its aerodynamic design back then, including the slope nose front end models in 1975 and 1976, the S-3 became the car of choice for many top NASCAR teams thanks to its slipstreaming properties at 200 mph. However, NASCAR was hot off eliminating from competition other aerodynamic cars like the 1970 Plymouth Superbird and the Mercury Talladega models, so after the 1976 season they outlaw the slope nose Laguna from further competition. Page 2 of 2 - Overall, GM’s new Colonnade A Body Platform was not too much different than the previous A Body platforms that dated back in 1962. Further, if you look close at the 1966 to 1972 A-Body cars you’ll find the design may have changed quite a bit but the drivetrain did not, minus the lower compression engines. Still, even in a time of corporate crisis in building new small cars, it was the 1974 to 1976 Laguna that featured upgrades in larger disc brakes and a new coil over spring rear suspension setup instead of the solid rear axle. As for current pricing, I’m sad to say the 1974 to 1976 Laguna S-3 will never be what a Chevelle SS454 is today. Current NADA Classic Car values have a 1974 Laguna Type S-3 with a 350 V-8 in at $7,650 in “high retail” condition, to an “average retail” of $4,140. I personally feel a Laguna S-3 350 is worth a bit more, and perhaps in the coming years it will increase in value due to its low production numbers. The Laguna 454 with a 4-speed? It’s at around $10,000 in NADA “high retail” condition, compared to a 1970 Chevelle SS454 with the LS6 engine that lists for a “high retail” of $159,000 from an original retail of $3,222! Prices like this prove you can’t erase what happened to muscle cars when the gas crisis hit and  manufacturers went to unleaded gas, smog\/emission controls and low compression engines. It just plain killed the collector value of cars from the mid to late 1970 decade. In ending, to find the parts you need I recommend picking up a copy of Auto Round-Up or Hemmings Motor News that cater to the collector car hobby. There are also hundreds of online businesses that cater to restoration of Chevrolet cars and trucks specifically, so if you have a friend or family member with a computer, check it out, and look at eBay too.

Rifle hosts first-ever electric vehicle ride and drive event. Drivers are invited to get behind the wheel of a plug-in electric car at Rifle’s first-ever electric vehicle ride-and-drive event on Thursday, Sept. 17. 
 
The free event offers motorists a chance to learn about several models of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) and about options for charging at home, at work and at the growing number of public charging stations across the state and country. 
 
Rifle’s EV Ride and Drive is set for 5-7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 17, at the Rifle City Hall and Rifle Branch Library parking lot. The event is one block from the Rifle Farmer’s Market, open the same evening. 
 
Rifle’s ride and drive is one of 167 electric vehicle events happening across the country for National Drive Electric Week, running Sept. 12-20. 
 
Mountain Chevrolet will show two Chevy Volts, and Glenwood Springs Ford will show the Ford C-Max Energi, with knowledgeable sales staff offering test drives. 
 
Electric vehicle experts Matt Shmigelsky of Garfield Clean Energy and Zac Sutherland of Garfield County Environmental Health will be on hand to answer questions about vehicle charging, other makes and models on the market and the attractive state and federal tax credits offered for new plug-in electric vehicles. 
 
Stephanie Stocking will show how to access more info about electric cars by using the Rifle Branch Library’s many resources. 
 
“Electric vehicles are the future of passenger car transportation, and the future is here today with vehicles that are on the market now,” Shmigelsky said. Nationwide, there are more than 300,000 plug-in electric vehicles on the road today. 
 
Plug-in electric cars that are all-electric have a range of 75 to 200 miles, Shmigelsky said, while plug-in hybrids can travel 20 to 50 miles on electricity before switching over to gasoline power. Tax credits vary, depending on the vehicle’s capacity to travel on electric power, and help offset the purchase price. 
 
EVs are less expensive to operate, with fuel costs that are comparable to $1.10 per gallon, and less maintenance needed, he added. 
 
Sutherland said EVs are clean burning, producing no tailpipe emissions while running on electricity. And EVs run on Colorado-produced electricity, supporting jobs on the Western Slope, he added. 
 
Free public EV charging stations are open at Colorado Mountain College in Rifle, the Parachute I-70 Rest Area and the Cooper Avenue parking structure in Glenwood Springs. 
 
To drive up installation of more charging stations, the Colorado Energy Office offers grants that can fund up to 80 percent of the cost. Private sector employers, schools, hospitals, governments and apartment buildings are all eligible for these Charge Ahead grants. 
 
The state’s electric vehicle licensing fee funds the grant program. 
 
“Garfield Clean Energy can offer free help for anyone seeking to apply for the grant,” Shmigelsky said. 
 
The Rifle EV Ride and Drive event is hosted by Garfield Clean Energy, the city of Rifle, Garfield County Environmental Health, the Rifle Area Chamber of Commerce and the Rifle Branch Library. Sponsors are Mountain Chevrolet and Glenwood Springs Ford. 
 
National Drive Electric Week is sponsored by Plug In America, Sierra Club and Electric Auto Association.

(Reuters) – U.S. automaker General Motors Co said on Wednesday it will jointly develop and assemble medium-duty commercial vehicles with truck and engine maker Navistar International Corp. 
 
GM said on Wednesday the agreement will help boost its Chevrolet commercial truck business. 
 
The move “strengthens Chevrolet’s providing commercial customers with more choices and one-stop shopping for a versatile lineup of trucks, vans and crossovers,” Ed Peper, GM’s U.S. vice president of fleet and commercial sales said in a statement. 
 
The future products will be jointly developed using Navistar’s rolling chassis configurations and manufacturing capabilities, and GM commercial components and engines. 
 
Production will begin in 2018 at Navistar’s plant in Springfield, Ohio. 
 
Navistar said it would add 300 jobs and invest more than $12 million to upgrade the factory and equipment. 
 
The companies did not disclose specific terms of the agreement. 
 
The deal with GM will help Navistar “enhance our medium-duty product portfolio and leverage our scale and expertise in manufacturing medium-duty trucks,” said Bill Kozek, president of trucks and parts at Navistar. 
 
The Lisle, Illinois-based truck maker, which was once a leading maker of truck engines, continues to try to turn itself around after making a disastrous bet on a costly and unsuccessful proprietary smog-reduction system. 
 
The emissions-related debacle sent Navistar’s warranty expenses skyrocketing even as sales tumbled. 
 
Earlier this month, Navistar posted its 12th consecutive quarterly loss, but executives said ongoing restructuring actions would help the company become profitable and have positive cash flow in 2016. 
 
In early trading, Navistar shares were down 0.8 percent at $12.45. GM shares were up nearly 1.4 percent at $29.55.

Chevrolet have introduced the sixth-generation of their iconic muscle car, the Camaro, with a choice of three engines, including a turbo four. 
 

 
The muscle-car evolution continues with the all-new Camaro. The 2016 model appears with an even narrower front grille and a larger air dam, as compared to the then revamped and reintroduced Camaro from six years ago, which grew extremely popular on account of its aggressive front face and design language, and also featured as ‘Bumblebee’ in the Transformers movie franchise. Another noticeable change? The absence of the gills on the front of the rear wheel arches; a signature design element on the Camaro from 1969, and 2009. 
 
The 3.6-litre V6 and 6.2-litre V8 engines are still on offer, but have been improved, and in a big way. The V6 petrol engine is still direct-injected and features continuously variable valve timing. It now packs 340 PS and 385 Nm. However, the main change is the introduction of Active Fuel Management using cylinder deactivation. 
 
The V8 gets the benefit of direct injection and, thus, a significant bump in power, torque and efficiency. The growling bad-boy Small-Block LT-1 (from the Corvette Stingray) now makes 461 PS of peak grunt and 617 Nm of torque, a significant step up. The SS version also packs Magnetic Ride Control, as seen on the Cadillac CTS-V. Active Fuel Management is available on automatic transmission models. The claimed 0-100 sprint time is now just 4 seconds! Weight-loss is to the tune of over 90 kg. 
 
A new addition to the line-up is the 2.0-litre turbocharged and direct injected four-cylinder petrol engine with 279 PS and 400 Nm. This was the inevitable, because of A) emission norms, and B) the Ford Mustang EcoBoost. Even so, with a 5.4-second 0-100 km\/h dash and a 14-seconds quarter mile, this engine is out to prove itself worthy. 
 

 
There’s more changes on the inside and on the technology front with the inclusion of drive modes for Snow\/Ice, Tour and Sport, with the SS getting a Track mode too. Spectrum Lighting uses 24 different ambient lighting effects on the dashboard, door panels, and the centre console. 
 
Whether the Camaro will come to India still remains a mystery, but in our hearts, we hope that the arrival of the Ford Mustang GT will have the Indian arm of Chevy knocking on their HQ’s doors, and then, there’s the Dodge Challenger.

Cars We Remember: 1974 Chevy Laguna Type S-3. Q: Hi, Greg. First I want to tell you I enjoy your articles on the older cars and your auto experiences. I still have my 1974 Chevy Malibu Laguna Type S-3 that I bought brand new from the  Ferrario Chevrolet dealership in Wysox, Pennsylvania, back in 1974. I am hoping you can give me some history on this car and its current value. The car is original with 52,000 miles on it. It has the 350 V-8 engine with an automatic transmission. I need to buy some parts for the car that I can’t seem to find. I need rear bumper filler in white and also rubber bumper guards as they are cracking and falling apart.  Thanks very much, Bob Best, Canton, Pennsylvania. A: Bob, thank you very much for your handwritten letter and the kind words. Your Laguna S-3 was produced from 1974 to 1976 on GM’s new Colonnade A-Body platform assembly line, which was also responsible for many of the sibling mid-size Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Buicks back then. Your car looks to be an exceptional example of an original 1974 Laguna S-3 where 350, 400 and 454-inch engines still found a home. All engines in 1974 had to adapt to the new smog and unleaded gasoline requirements, effectively lowering compression ratios which resulted in big horsepower losses. Still, your 350 V-8 powered Laguna is quite the attractive car and is one that is getting even rarer for several reasons. First, the 1974 Laguna S-3 was not a big seller that year. Laguna models were expensive as they were sharing much of the interior influences with the Chevy Monte Carlo. This non-robust lack of sales for V-8 and performance cars back then resulted in a new “consumer code” that pointed to small cars and fuel economy. Thus the mid-size Laguna was not a top choice by any means even though its sibling Chevelle Malibu sold well in six-cylinder and smaller V-8 trim. The good news for a car collector is production numbers, or, better yet, lack thereof.  Of the 312,265 Chevelle Malibu sedans and coupes produced in 1974, only 15,792 were option E37, specifically the new Laguna S-3 V-8 that carried a base price of $3,723.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. Crew Chief Greg Ives Takes Lead in Battle for $100,000 MOOG® 'Problem Solver of the Year' Award. Southfield, Michigan, September 15, 2015.Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the MOOG ® Steering and Suspension-equipped No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS captured their 12 th top-five finish of the year in Saturday's Federated Auto Parts 400 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup event at Richmond (Va.) International Raceway. Perhaps the biggest news for the Hendrick Motorsports-owned team, however, was that crew chief Greg Ives earned his fourth MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award, giving him the lead in the battle for $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" honors. 
    
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Problem Solver of the Year award goes to the crew chief with the most weekly MOOG award wins throughout the 36-race Sprint Cup season. Ives earned Saturday's weekly award after the 88 car improved by a race-best 0.154-second-per-lap to finish fifth. 
 
After starting in 29 th position, the 88 car moved into the top 15 within the first 110 laps. Earnhardt cracked the top 10 just 24 laps later and remained among the lead pack for much of the rest of the night. He advanced to seventh with just over 100 laps remaining and to fifth position on Lap 314 (of 400). The 88 briefly fell back one position but ran strong during the final 18-lap green-flag run to secure a top-five finish. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
 
Earnhardt and Ives, like 15 other sets of Cup drivers and crew chiefs, now prepare for the Challenger Round of the Chase, which begins Sunday at Chicagoland Speedway. The 88 team holds the sixth seed in the field of 16 Chase qualifiers. 
 
""Dale Junior and Greg ran a smart race, knowing they had a Chase spot sewn up but still wanting to head into the Challenger Round with a strong finish,"" said Tim Nelson, director of Motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""A top five gives them something positive to build on for next week, and now Greg has even more at stake as the leader in our year-end Problem Solver award standings."" 
 
With four weekly MOOG awards, Ives now holds a one-win lead over rookie crew chief Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly award through the first 26 Cup races. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

Still, your 350 V-8 powered Laguna is quite the attractive car and is one that is getting even rarer for several reasons. First, the 1974 Laguna S-3 was not a big seller that year. Laguna models were expensive as they were sharing much of the interior influences with the Chevy Monte Carlo. This non-robust lack of sales for V-8 and performance cars back then resulted in a new “consumer code” that pointed to small cars and fuel economy. Thus the mid-size Laguna was not a top choice by any means even though its sibling Chevelle Malibu sold well in six-cylinder and smaller V-8 trim. The good news for a car collector is production numbers, or, better yet, lack thereof.  Of the 312,265 Chevelle Malibu sedans and coupes produced in 1974, only 15,792 were option E37, specifically the new Laguna S-3 V-8 that carried a base price of $3,723. Additionally, it was the Laguna S-3 that replaced the famed Chevelle SS in the Chevy lineup, offering a sleek new body design and those body colored bumpers you now seek. (See the owner’s photo attached.) The second reason for being a rare collector car is plain old attrition. Many Chevelles and Malibus and all other A Body creations ended up at the scrap yard long before muscle cars became popular in the hobby. Personally, I always felt the Laguna S-3 was a great looking car, and because of its aerodynamic design back then, including the slope nose front end models in 1975 and 1976, the S-3 became the car of choice for many top NASCAR teams thanks to its slipstreaming properties at 200 mph. However, NASCAR was hot off eliminating from competition other aerodynamic cars like the 1970 Plymouth Superbird and the Mercury Talladega models, so after the 1976 season they outlaw the slope nose Laguna from further competition. Page 2 of 2 - Overall, GM’s new Colonnade A Body Platform was not too much different than the previous A Body platforms that dated back in 1962. Further, if you look close at the 1966 to 1972 A-Body cars you’ll find the design may have changed quite a bit but the drivetrain did not, minus the lower compression engines. Still, even in a time of corporate crisis in building new small cars, it was the 1974 to 1976 Laguna that featured upgrades in larger disc brakes and a new coil over spring rear suspension setup instead of the solid rear axle. As for current pricing, I’m sad to say the 1974 to 1976 Laguna S-3 will never be what a Chevelle SS454 is today. Current NADA Classic Car values have a 1974 Laguna Type S-3 with a 350 V-8 in at $7,650 in “high retail” condition, to an “average retail” of $4,140. I personally feel a Laguna S-3 350 is worth a bit more, and perhaps in the coming years it will increase in value due to its low production numbers. The Laguna 454 with a 4-speed? It’s at around $10,000 in NADA “high retail” condition, compared to a 1970 Chevelle SS454 with the LS6 engine that lists for a “high retail” of $159,000 from an original retail of $3,222! Prices like this prove you can’t erase what happened to muscle cars when the gas crisis hit and  manufacturers went to unleaded gas, smog\/emission controls and low compression engines. It just plain killed the collector value of cars from the mid to late 1970 decade. In ending, to find the parts you need I recommend picking up a copy of Auto Round-Up or Hemmings Motor News that cater to the collector car hobby. There are also hundreds of online businesses that cater to restoration of Chevrolet cars and trucks specifically, so if you have a friend or family member with a computer, check it out, and look at eBay too. Thanks for your letter Bob and take care of that rare Laguna S-3. Greg Zyla writes weekly for More Content Now, BestRide.com and other GateHouse Media publications.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. Crew Chief Greg Ives Takes Lead in Battle for $100,000 MOOG® 'Problem Solver of the Year' Award. Southfield, Michigan, September 15, 2015.Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the MOOG ® Steering and Suspension-equipped No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS captured their 12 th top-five finish of the year in Saturday's Federated Auto Parts 400 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup event at Richmond (Va.) International Raceway. Perhaps the biggest news for the Hendrick Motorsports-owned team, however, was that crew chief Greg Ives earned his fourth MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award, giving him the lead in the battle for $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" honors. 
    
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Problem Solver of the Year award goes to the crew chief with the most weekly MOOG award wins throughout the 36-race Sprint Cup season. Ives earned Saturday's weekly award after the 88 car improved by a race-best 0.154-second-per-lap to finish fifth. 
 
After starting in 29 th position, the 88 car moved into the top 15 within the first 110 laps. Earnhardt cracked the top 10 just 24 laps later and remained among the lead pack for much of the rest of the night. He advanced to seventh with just over 100 laps remaining and to fifth position on Lap 314 (of 400). The 88 briefly fell back one position but ran strong during the final 18-lap green-flag run to secure a top-five finish. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
 
Earnhardt and Ives, like 15 other sets of Cup drivers and crew chiefs, now prepare for the Challenger Round of the Chase, which begins Sunday at Chicagoland Speedway. The 88 team holds the sixth seed in the field of 16 Chase qualifiers. 
 
""Dale Junior and Greg ran a smart race, knowing they had a Chase spot sewn up but still wanting to head into the Challenger Round with a strong finish,"" said Tim Nelson, director of Motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""A top five gives them something positive to build on for next week, and now Greg has even more at stake as the leader in our year-end Problem Solver award standings."" 
 
With four weekly MOOG awards, Ives now holds a one-win lead over rookie crew chief Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly award through the first 26 Cup races. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

HUG#1952022. UPDATE 1-GM and Navistar to develop and make commercial trucks. (Adds details of agreement, background on Navistar, stock
prices) 

Sept 30 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker General Motors Co 
said on Wednesday it will jointly develop and assemble
medium-duty commercial vehicles with truck and engine maker
Navistar International Corp. 

GM said on Wednesday the agreement will help boost its
Chevrolet commercial truck business. 

The move ""strengthens Chevrolet's providing commercial
customers with more choices and one-stop shopping for a
versatile lineup of trucks, vans and crossovers,"" Ed Peper, GM's
U.S. vice president of fleet and commercial sales said in a
statement. 

The future products will be jointly developed using
Navistar's rolling chassis configurations and manufacturing
capabilities, and GM commercial components and engines. 
 
Production will begin in 2018 at Navistar's plant in
Springfield, Ohio. 

Navistar said it would add 300 jobs and invest more than $12
million to upgrade the factory and equipment. 
 
The companies did not disclose specific terms of the
agreement. 

The deal with GM will help Navistar ""enhance our medium-duty
product portfolio and leverage our scale and expertise in
manufacturing medium-duty trucks,"" said Bill Kozek, president of
trucks and parts at Navistar. 
 
The Lisle, Illinois-based truck maker, which was once a
leading maker of truck engines, continues to try to turn itself
around after making a disastrous bet on a costly and
unsuccessful proprietary smog-reduction system. 

The emissions-related debacle sent Navistar's warranty
expenses skyrocketing even as sales tumbled. 

Earlier this month, Navistar posted its 12th consecutive
quarterly loss, but executives said ongoing restructuring
actions would help the company become profitable and have
positive cash flow in 2016. 

In early trading, Navistar shares were down 0.8 percent at
$12.45. GM shares were up nearly 1.4 percent at $29.55.

1920x1200	Chevrolet presents two concept coupes at NAIAS 2012
Chevrolet today introduced two concept coupes at the 2012 North American International Auto Show aimed at inspiring next-generation buyers to take the wheel and suggest ideas for a car they can co-create. ""Chevrolet has always stood for making the aspirational attainable for all generations"" said General Motors North America President Mark Reuss. ""These two concepts interpret that vision for a new generation. We're seeking out our newest customers' opinions, listening to their advice, and engaging them in new ways."" According to U.S. Census data, there are 80 million American consumers approaching 30. They represent 40 percent of today's potential car-buying public and a combined $1 trillion in purchasing power. Over the past year, Chevrolet has conversed with young consumers across the United States. Based on their feedback, the Chevrolet concepts explore the styling and functionality this group of new buyers says they are looking for in a car. Code 130R, the first Chevrolet concept, is a four-seat coupe with a simple upright profile. Painted in an all-new red metallic paint with matte anodized gold wheels, Code 130R features heritage performance-inspired styling and rear-wheel drive. With an aggressive front fascia, Chevrolet fender flares, straight body side and Chevy crossflag emblem, Code 130R makes a link to Chevrolet's performance heritage. Code 130R's designers conceived the turbocharged engine to be tuned to work in tandem with eAssist technology. By shutting off the engine at stops, recapturing braking energy, and smoothing torque during acceleration, this concept takes automotive electrification to the next level and balances turbocharged performance with fuel economy. Tru 140S, the second Chevrolet concept is a front-wheel-drive, ""affordable exotic"" four-seat sporty coupe. The three-door hatchback was designed to be an attractive-yet-affordable sports car. Shown in an all-new matte white with Chevy performance chrome wheels featuring crossflag emblems, Tru 140S is designed to look confident, exotic, expensive and fast. Tru 140S is based off the same platform as the Chevrolet Cruze and the groundbreaking Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle with extended range. Tru 140S designers want to demonstrate technologies typically found in more expensive cars, including direct injection and a starter-based stop-start technology, balancing internal combustion and electrification to deliver high value and improved fuel economy. The concepts share attributes younger buyers say they value: Sedan-sized functionality in performance coupe form that seats four passengers Interior connectivity and convenience featuring innovative storage, WiFi, smart phone integration with Chevrolet MyLink and heads-up display 40 MPG with a 1.4L Turbo Ecotec engine with approximately 150 horsepower Possible production price range in the low $20,000s ""Young customers tell us they want functionality with coupe-like aesthetics. Both the Code and Tru body styles resonated with this audience,"" said Frank Saucedo, director of the GM North America Advanced Design studio in Los Angeles where the two concepts were developed. Inside the concepts, connectivity and personalization enable the individualization that the generation says is essential. ""This buyer prizes connectivity. Allowing them to stay connected by integrating their personal devices through MyLink and WiFi enabling the vehicle to be their own docking station,"" said Saucedo. ""The interiors currently exist in 2D only. This allows us the flexibility to continue the discussion and encourage more dialogue as we continue to develop these concepts."" From Detroit, the pair of Chevrolet concepts will travel to major auto shows, key lifestyle events, one-on-one experiences and other venues such as college campuses. Chevrolet also will engage customers using the social media tools that young consumers use to talk with one another. ""For the car company that can successfully engage this generation, there is a tremendous opportunity,"" said John McFarland, senior manager for Chevrolet Global Marketing, who heads youth research for the brand. ""At Chevrolet, we want to build authentic and meaningful relationships with these customers on their terms. We want to hear what they have to say, engage them in our design process, and give them what they want – not what we think they want.""

HUG#1952022. Exclusive: GM to tap into connectivity, expand car sharing services – CEO. By Joseph White 

 
 

By Joseph White 

DETROIT (NEWS.GNOM.ES) – General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra said the automaker plans new efforts to capitalize on the connectivity built into its cars, expanding car sharing services, offering more autonomous driving features and enabling services through smartphone apps. 

“Our goal is to disrupt ourselves, and own the customer relationship beyond the car,” Barra told NEWS.GNOM.ES in an interview Monday ahead of a meeting with investors and analysts scheduled for Oct. 1. 

Using technology embedded in its cars, she said, a customer who owns a Chevrolet Malibu could step into a Cadillac CTS and the luxury car could import from a smartphone app the driver’s preferences for how the car should function. 

It would be “a hop, skip and a jump” for GM to offer broader car sharing services, she said. GM’s autonomous driving feature, SuperCruise, will also make use of high-speed data connections in cars when it launches next year. 

Connectivity and apps will also help GM keep tabs on what customers are doing with their cars and how they are responding to features such as automatic braking or hands-free highway driving, Barra said. Companies such as Apple Inc and Google Inc are pushing to dominate dashboard displays with their software, but “we have the platform” of the vehicle itself,  Barra said. 

GM has moved more aggressively than most of its rivals to put high-speed, 4G LTE data connections in its cars. 

“We sold more 4G LTE connected vehicles in three days in June than the rest of the industry did in the first half of the year,” Phil Abram, GM’s executive director for connectivity said in a separate interview 

GM forecasts that from 2014 to 2018 it will earn about $350 million before interest and taxes on connectivity related services – a rounding error on GM’s projected revenue. Barra said the value in connectivity will grow if GM can inspire customers to stick with its brands for life, and provide data GM can use to tailor features and services. 

GM and many of its established rivals, including Ford Motor Co, BMW AG,Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG  are under pressure to demonstrate they will not be left in the dust as companies with roots in the digital technology industry, including Apple and search giant Google Inc, electric car pioneer Tesla Motors Inc and ride-sharing power Uber try to reinvent transportation. 

The threat from Silicon Valley, concern about rising regulatory costs in the wake of Volkswagen AG emissions scandal and economic uncertainty in China have combined to drive most auto stocks into the ditch this year. GM’s shares traded Monday about 12 percent below their $33 per share initial public offering price – despite Barra’s promise earlier this year to return $10 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends through 2016. 

Barra gets good marks from analysts and investors for delivering on the automaker’s profit targets so far – including maintaining a forecast of 9 to 10 percent profit margins in China despite rapidly decelerating growth in vehicle demand.  Earlier this month, GM paid $900 million to settle a criminal probe of mishandled recalls, dispelling a dark cloud on its horizon. 

Barra in the interview confirmed earlier forecasts of 9 to 10 percent profit margins in China, breaking even in Europe next year and completing the $5 billion in share buybacks by the end of next year. 

“We think the market is not fairly valuing the progress GM has made,” said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. While he welcomed GM’s initiatives on autonomous driving and disruptive mobility, “we’re not sure that will move the needle on the stock price.”

Finance Autos General Motors Mary Barra. Dale Earnhardt Jr. Crew Chief Greg Ives Takes Lead in Battle for $100,000 MOOG® 'Problem Solver of the Year' Award. Southfield, Michigan, September 15, 2015.Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the MOOG ® Steering and Suspension-equipped No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS captured their 12 th top-five finish of the year in Saturday's Federated Auto Parts 400 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup event at Richmond (Va.) International Raceway. Perhaps the biggest news for the Hendrick Motorsports-owned team, however, was that crew chief Greg Ives earned his fourth MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award, giving him the lead in the battle for $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" honors. 
    
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Problem Solver of the Year award goes to the crew chief with the most weekly MOOG award wins throughout the 36-race Sprint Cup season. Ives earned Saturday's weekly award after the 88 car improved by a race-best 0.154-second-per-lap to finish fifth. 
 
After starting in 29 th position, the 88 car moved into the top 15 within the first 110 laps. Earnhardt cracked the top 10 just 24 laps later and remained among the lead pack for much of the rest of the night. He advanced to seventh with just over 100 laps remaining and to fifth position on Lap 314 (of 400). The 88 briefly fell back one position but ran strong during the final 18-lap green-flag run to secure a top-five finish. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
 
Earnhardt and Ives, like 15 other sets of Cup drivers and crew chiefs, now prepare for the Challenger Round of the Chase, which begins Sunday at Chicagoland Speedway. The 88 team holds the sixth seed in the field of 16 Chase qualifiers. 
 
""Dale Junior and Greg ran a smart race, knowing they had a Chase spot sewn up but still wanting to head into the Challenger Round with a strong finish,"" said Tim Nelson, director of Motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""A top five gives them something positive to build on for next week, and now Greg has even more at stake as the leader in our year-end Problem Solver award standings."" 
 
With four weekly MOOG awards, Ives now holds a one-win lead over rookie crew chief Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly award through the first 26 Cup races. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

©2015 PR Newswire. All Rights Reserved.. Bigger is better for saloon lovers. CROSSOVERS, people carriers and other, more versatile, motors may be eating into sales of big saloons, but there is no stopping the flow of new models. 
 
At the bargain end of the big saloon market comes the new Chevrolet Epica, which goes on sale in the UK on April 26. 
 
It takes Chevrolet into an entirely new area of the market, yet falls into step with the brand's reputation for unbeatable value. 
 
The 4.80-metres long car is larger than most family saloons, yet - here is the best bit - it costs from £13,595. 
 
At that price, it will find favour who love to get a lot of car for their money, because Chevrolet claims there is no skimping on standard equipment with the Epica. 
 
Power is supplied by a choice of 2.0-litre petrol and diesel engines, and there are two trim levels, LS and LT. 
 
All models get air conditioning, cruise control, electric front and rear windows, a CD-stereo with MP3 input, remote audio controls, front fog lamps, 16-inch alloy wheels, front, side and curtain
airbags, and powered door mirrors. 
 
LT specification adds electronic climate control, rear parking sensors, leather seat trim, heated front seats, rain-sensitive wipers, a CD autochanger, a light-sensitive rear view mirror,
power-adjustable driver's seat, a trip computer, electronic stability, and 17-inch alloys. With all that in, LT models will be diesel only, costing £16,595 for the five-speed manual, or £17,695 for
the automatic. 
   Promoted stories   
Honda's new Accord saloon, which goes on sale in Britain on June 1 - the Tourer, or estate, model follows on September 1 - will provide more of a challenge to the premium saloons in the
D-segment. 
 
Three advanced, low-emissions engines - a 2.2-litre diesel, and 2.0-litre and 2.4-litre petrols - will provide the power, and all are matched to a six-speed manual transmission, with the petrols
having the option of a five-speed automatic. An automatic gearbox for the diesel unit will be launched early in 2009. To improve the drive, the Accord development team used the highly-rated BMW 3
Series as a benchmark, and claims the new car has greater agility, thanks to a lowered centre of gravity, a wider track and all-new suspension. 
 
Speed-sensitive electric power steering is standard on all models, and high-quality materials have been used throughout the new Accord for an outstanding fit and finish. 
 
Honda's latest safety technology is fitted, and includes the option of CMBS - the Collision Mitigation Braking System. 
 
CMBS monitors the distance and closing rate between the Accord and the car directly in front of it, warning the driver of a likely collision with alarms and tugs on the seatbelt. If the system
detects that a collision is unavoidable, it automatically applies braking to reduce the effects of an impact.

3,ford,"Driven Alfa Romeo Giulietta Business Edition. Traditionally a heart-over-head choice of manufacturer, Alfa Romeo is trying to up its fleet sales with the introduction of a Giulietta that will appeal to your wallet (and your fleet manager) as much as it appeals to your inner petrol-head. Cue the arrival of the Giulietta Business Edition.
The concept is simple: take the Italian manufacturer’s most fleet-orientated car, fit the new, more powerful, more economical 1.6-litre Euro 6 diesel engine and give it a host of technology designed to make the company car driver’s life a little easier
Alfa Romeo Giulietta1.6 JTDM-2 120 Business 5drProfile:9+35Mileage:8k Miles p\/a£151.28Per Month, EXC VATBusiness Users OnlyView DetailsBusiness Leasing Deal by: V4B LtdSee our Alfa Romeo Giulietta leasing deals here: Business \/ PersonalBelies the kit list
An asking price of just over £19,000 makes the Business Edition about £600 more expensive than the entry-level car, but the price tag belies the kit list.
Satellite navigation, 17in alloy wheels, front and rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, voice control and metallic paint all feature as standard.
You also get the 1.6-litre MultiJet diesel engine - a powerplant you're normally charged more than £1,000 for.
Recently upgraded to meet the Euro 6 emissions regulations, the four-cylinder unit has had its power output increased from 103bhp to 118bhp, while carbon dioxide emissions have dropped from 104g\/km to a road tax-avoiding 99g\/km.
As a result, the Business Edition drops a company car tax bracket to 17% and now returns 74.3mpg – up more than 5% on the 70.6mpg afforded by the old engine.
The power hike has made sure that the new engine is faster though, with the 0-62mph sprint now dealt with in ten seconds flat (down from the old car’s 11.3 seconds) and the top speed increased by 6mph to 121mph.
It doesn’t sound rapid, but a bucketful of torque ensures it feels faster than the figures suggest. There's a slight flat spot low down, but as the revs build the Giulietta surges ahead with urgency and though you'll have to work the six-speed manual transmission, making swift progress is perfectly feasible.Good cruiser
Considering this is an Alfa Romeo, however, it isn't especially sporty. Yes, selecting Dynamic on the DNA drive mode selector will sharpen the throttle response and add weight to the steering, but a Ford Focus will provide more smiles per mile.
The pedals are all wrong, with poor positioning and a very spongy middle pedal controlling grabby brakes, while the car also suffers from the classic Italian short leg\/long arm driving position and totally numb steering. The gearbox isn't perfect either, but it's still one of the car's better features.
Reading all that might make you think the Giulietta is totally devoid of redeeming features and unworthy of any further consideration, but don't be quite so hasty.
Although the Giulietta is no hot hatch, it is quite a good motorway cruiser and, let's face it, company cars tend to spend more time cruising up and down the M1 than setting lap records at Mallory Park.
There's an awful lot of sound proofing under the bonnet and elsewhere in a (successful) bid to keep engine noise out of the cabin, while road and wind noise have been kept to a minimum too.
It's also comfortable, with supportive seats and just about enough space both in the boot and in the back to make it practical.Drop-dead gorgeous
The customary Alfa idiosyncrasies remain, however, with a seat adjustment that's almost totally inaccessible when the seat belt is fastened, there's absolutely nowhere to put your left foot and some of the plastics feel like they were made from recycled hard hats.
It may not drive like an Alfasud, but there's plenty there to remind you that it's from the same stable.
And you can forgive all the problems when you park up at the end of your journey, clamber out, lock the doors (cue irritating beeps) and have a look at what brought you all that way.
Very little in this class is even vaguely pretty, let alone this pretty. The Focus has something about it, but it's hardly drop-dead gorgeous, the Mazda3 is handsome in a slightly weird, angular kind of way and the VW Golf? Well that's quite classy but it just looks dull when parked alongside the curvy Giulietta.
From every angle it's stunning, with perfect proportions, doe eyes lined by striking LED daytime running lights and the Alfa grille cleaving its way down the front to provide a fitting centrepiece. Then, when you look at it from the rear, there are the exquisite tail lights and the squat stance. Even the key fob is a thing of beauty.The verdict
We'd never recommend that you make the Giulietta Business Edition your next company car - it has too many quirks and too many excellent rivals for that - but if you've had your heart set on an Alfa since you were old enough to know what an Alfa was, here's one you might actually be able to justify.

Price: £19,080. Driven: New Ford Mondeo. Ford celebrates an important 21st birthday as the fifth generation all-new Ford Mondeo goes on sale in the UK. 
 
The new Mondeo is a more sophisticated design - thanks to a distinctive chrome grille and creases running along the flanks - while offering increased comfort and refinement over the previous model. New technological features include Ford’s adaptive LED headlamps, Inflatable Rear Seatbelts and Multi-Contour Seats. 
 
Available in four-door and five-door body styles, and as an estate – developed specifically for Europe – the all new Mondeo is powered by a mix of powertrains, including diesel, petrol and hybrid. 
 
The diesel options include a 115 PS 1.6-litre (94 g\/km of CO2) and a twin turbo 2.0-litre, available in 150PS or 180PS guises. Petrol power is made up from a pair of EcoBoost units: a 125 PS 1.0 litre and 160 PS 1.5-litre. 
 
The Mondeo Hybrid combines a specially-developed 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor and 1.4 kWh lithium-ion battery to provide optimised fuel economy and CO2 emissions of 99 g\/km. 
 
Tested here is the 150 PS 2.0-litre diesel. It’s a strong engine, offering plenty of punch and flexibility, accelerating smoothly from low down the rev range. 
   Promoted stories   
All incarnations of the Mondeo have been praised for their sharp handling and responsive controls and it’s much the same story for the new car: it turns precisely into corners and remains stable and composed along twisty B-roads, while the gear change is crisp and direct. What has changed a bit is the steering, which now feels more assisted than before, although it remains accurate. 
 
Comfort and refinement however, sees a marked improvement on the previous Mondeo, with bumps and lumps in the road now being more convincingly smoothed out. This 2.0 litre diesel rarely raises its voice either, remaining firmly in the background. Road and wind noise are also well insulated from the cabin. 
 
There’s no getting away from the fact that the Mondeo is a large car, so parking can be a bit tricky at times. However, the driving position is spot on, offering plenty of adjustment and affording a good view of the road. The large dimensions also mean Mondeo has plenty of room for its occupants – especially leg and shoulder room. However, rather surprisingly, taller rear passengers may find themselves a bit short on headroom – no doubt due to the car’s steeply raked roof line. As you’d expect, the boot is very large and provides 550 litres (seats up) and 1,446 litres (seats down). Estate models boast an even more impressive 1,630 litres of boot space (with seats lowered). 
 
The Ford Mondeo’s cabin has taken a big step-up in quality and comfort, showcasing considerably greater quality of materials. There’s now also much more technology on offer, including a comprehensive touch-screen infotainment system, with voice activated functionality on selected models. 
 
Five different trim levels make up the new Mondeo range: Style, Zetec, Titanium, Titanium X and Vignale. Equipment on base-spec Style models is surprisingly generous and includes: LED tail lights, alloy wheels, 8” full-colour touch-screen, dual-zone climate control, cruise control and DAB radio. Zetec adds height-adjustment on the passenger seat, rear electric windows, heated quick-clear windscreen and electric folding door mirrors. High spec Titanium also benefits from bigger alloys, auto wipers and lights, sports seats, push button engine start and satellite navigation. 
 
At the very top of the range sits the high-spec Vignale, which includes luxury details such as a bespoke leather covered dashboard, different alloy wheels and additional exterior chrome trim. 
 
 Verdict:  
 
The new Ford Mondeo isn’t quite as sharp to drive as its predecessor, but makes up for it with new technological features, classier looks and greater comfort and refinement.

Press Release Distributed by PR.com. Ford Research & Engineering Center goes landfill-free. Ford Motor Company’s Research & Engineering Center is now landfill free, helping the automaker achieve its goal to trim global waste-to-landfill by 40 percent per vehicle produced from 2011 to 2016. 
 
The R&E Center sits on 720 acres in Dearborn, Michigan near Ford World Headquarters. With more than 12,000 employees working out of 34 buildings including research labs, design studios, and a major data center, the campus is much like a small city. Paring waste streams will allow Ford to be more efficient while helping to improve the environment. 
 
“Our global waste strategy commits Ford to reducing waste-to-landfill, and we have made great progress at our manufacturing plants,” said Andy Hobbs, Ford Motor Company director, Environmental Quality Office. “We are now extending this effort to our office and research facilities, and are proud to recognize the Research & Engineering Center for sending zero waste-to-landfill.” 
 
Highlights include: 
 The nearly three-year effort to achieve landfill-free status started by identifying various waste streams and categorizing them from smallest to largest. Waste managers and environmental engineers then worked to find creative solutions to avoid using landfills while not incurring additional cost to manage the waste. The move also included recycling training for campus employees  The Research & Engineering Center houses test operations – including a test track, wind tunnels, crash sleds and dynamometers  The campus now diverts 230,000 pounds of waste from landfills annually  Ford has reduced the amount of global waste sent to landfills by 50 percent per vehicle over the last five years  Thirty Ford facilities no longer send any waste to landfills; this includes all Canadian and Mexican manufacturing plants  Ford is committed to improving its environmental impact. The company is working to shrink greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing facilities by 30 percent per vehicle between 2010 and 2025. Ford eased global water use by 30 percent per vehicle from a 2009 baseline – reaching its goal two years ahead of schedule. Since 2011, Ford has been working to trim energy consumption by 25 percent by 2016  Ford holds the No. 1 rank on Interbrand’s 2014 list of the 50 Best Global Green Brands. Ford claimed the top spot for its forward-thinking approach to environmentally responsible and sustainable manufacturing, and for greater transparency in its business operations and disclosure of information – particularly involving manufacturing  *Automotive World is not responsible for the content of this news release.. Our View: Upside to EPA's clean-air regs. The next time U.S. Rep. Billy Long takes a manufacturing tour of Joplin, we would encourage him to stop by the Modine Manufacturing plant. It provides an alternative perspective on the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean-air regulations. 
  
Long was in Joplin on Monday and among his stops was Empire District Electric Co.’s Asbury plant — a coal-fired plant that will be affected by President Barack Obama’s plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Power Plan. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas, and coal-fired power plants are the largest single source of carbon pollution. 
 
Long used his Joplin stop to argue that the proposed EPA rules are “onerous” and an “expensive proposition.” 
 
That it will cost ratepayers is undeniable. Equally undeniable is the importance of understanding the economic costs of regulations and making sure the benefit is worth the cost. 
 
Just how much these proposed regulations will cost Empire’s customers is still uncertain, according to the company. But it will be expensive. 
 
Most recently, in order to comply with EPA regulations aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and mercury emissions, the utility spent about $115 million on scrubbers, a baghouse and other technology. The ultimate cost of those regulations was about $8 per month for the typical Empire customer in Missouri. The result will be a 95 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, particulate matter emissions cut by 99 percent and mercury emissions cut by 85 percent, the utility has said. 
 
Is that worth $8 a month? We think so. Especially when you consider that the Missouri Department of Health, like its counterparts in many other states, has warned at-risk and sensitive populations — young children, women who might become pregnant, etc. — to limit their intake of many species of fish, including walleye, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and catfish, because of mercury accumulation in fish tissue. 
 
What’s this got to do with Modine? 
 
Not that many years ago, the EPA was pushing tough new standards for large engine manufacturers, with the goal being reductions in nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions. As you can imagine, the trucking industry and engine manufacturers fought it. 
 
But Modine, seeing opportunity, went to work. The company won programs with customers around the globe to supply engine manufacturers — Ford, Navistar, John Deere, etc. — with exhaust gas recirculation coolers, which recirculate exhaust from diesel engines back into the combustion process, resulting in lower emissions. In the last five years, sales of EGR coolers has generated more than $800 million for Modine. 
 
Modine’s Joplin plant became and remains the company’s EGR leader, which meant local jobs and a multimillion-dollar investment in the local economy. 
 
Modine also subsequently participated in the U.S. Department of Energy’s SuperTruck program to help the industry find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. The Joplin plant has been identified as a likely candidate for some of that work in the future. 
 
Setting aside the inestimable value of clean air and water, the point is that the regulations also have an economic upside. 
 
Like the emissions standards for truck engines, cleaner rules are coming for power plants. It is inevitable. The question we have for Long and others who are pushing back is this: Wouldn’t their time be better spent helping Southwest Missouri become home to the next generation of businesses that will supply the technology that will take us into the future? 
 
Status quo is easy. Solutions and opportunity are not. But that’s where our real leaders will be found.. Car Talk: When a car is a danger on the road, it’s time to say goodbye. Q I have a 1990 Ford Ranger with 110,000 miles on it. The chassis is thoroughly rusted — in fact, the charcoal canister tube rusted through and fell off. It leaks oil, burns oil and smells like coolant, which probably means it has a cracked head. The shocks are almost rusted through, and it makes noises when going over bumps (maybe the suspension is rusted through?). I do change the oil every 5,000 miles, but I add oil more often than that. I use it only to haul mulch, coal and wood, but it is my second vehicle, so it is important. It costs only $300 a year to insure, and I drive it fewer than 5,000 miles a year, so I do not need to have it emissions tested (thank goodness, because it stinks). I also do not drive any farther from my home than my insurance’s towing package covers. I plan to drive it until it just gives up the ghost. What should I do to increase the life of it? Are there any recommended things I should be doing besides praying? Should I be concerned about it catching on fire, since it leaks oil and really stinks? What about the gas lines, since they are rusted, too? Thanks. — Phil 
  
A You should pray that this thing catches fire, Phil. 

I know you’re afraid to take it to a bona fide mechanic, because you know the news is going to be awful. But if you want to keep this truck, that’s what you really need to do. You have to find out if this is still a viable, roadworthy vehicle. And I think we both know what the answer’s going to be. 

At the very least, you need to make sure the brakes are not about to fail, the wheels aren’t about to fall off, the frame isn’t held together by dust and the engine isn’t about to do its impersonation of the Burning Man finale. 
  
Seriously, it’s not just that the truck could disintegrate around you if you hit something, leaving your face as the bumper. You also could be — and probably are — a danger to all the other drivers on the road, because if your brakes fail or a wheel falls off, you could take other people with you. 

So my suggestion is that you thank this truck for its many years of service, say a Hail Mary over it, and drop it off at the junkyard. And instead, buy a used trailer. You say you have another vehicle; if it’s got any kind of decent towing capacity at all, you can put a trailer hitch on it, buy an old trailer and use it to haul your wood, coal and mulch. Or rent or borrow a truck for the times you actually need to haul stuff. 
  
But this truck sounds like a danger to you and others. Rather than haul mulch, I think it’s ready to become mulch. 

Of course, I know you’re going to ignore my advice, Phil. I’ve known determined cheapskates like you — Exhibit A was my late brother. So when you do ignore my advice, at least wear sneakers when you drive so that when it catches fire, you can run.

Ford has approved an investment of £181 million at its Bridgend Engine Plant in South Wales to produce a family of all-new, technologically-advanced, fuel-efficient petrol engines. 
 
The investment includes Welsh Government support of £14.67 million, with production planned to start in late 2018. 
 
The Ford announcement was welcomed by Welsh Economy Minister Edwina Hart: “Ford is a Welsh Anchor Company and the Bridgend Engine Plant plays a key role in the economy of South Wales. In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales and so we are delighted with today’s announcement. 
 
“Ford’s decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce and will safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years.” 
 
Teams from the Ford Dunton Technical Centre in Essex, as well as Ford’s Technical Centre in Merkenich Germany, and the Ford Research and Innovation Centre in Aachen, Germany, have worked together on the design and development of the all-new engine family. 
 
Earlier this year, Ford built its 5 millionth vehicle worldwide equipped with a fuel-efficient EcoBoost petrol engine, and in Europe more than one-in-four of all Ford vehicles sold are fitted with an EcoBoost engine. The 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine – winner of the International Engine of the Year for an unprecedented three years in succession – is the most popular EcoBoost version in Europe, with one-in-five vehicles sold in the region being equipped with the engine.. My Word - Sept. 9, 2015: Not mellow for yellow. Some years ago there was a study to discover the most stressful occupation. It turned out not to be the head of a large business or prime minister, but rather, a bus driver.

- Jonathan Sacks

They're back.

They're large, in charge, and obnoxiously yellow-orange. They are school buses, and if they haven't done so already, they're poised to make your daily commute more annoying than it's been in about 10 weeks.

If you don't have kids under the age of 18, the reopening of school isn't likely to influence your home routine much. But if you have to be somewhere at a certain time on weekday mornings or afternoons, you might want to start leaving the house 15 minutes earlier than usual. 

As drivers, it's a wonder how quickly we get used to not dealing with these behemoths throughout the summer months. In places where traffic congestion isn't a fact of life, they're probably not noticed as much, but in hectic North Jersey, they're simply one more aggravation to contend with.

For suburban moms and dads, however, they're a godsend and a necessity. Imagine how difficult it would be for every parent to make time to drop off and pick up their kids Monday through Friday. Not only would this seriously impact people's ability to work a regular shift, it would make for a tremendous procession of cars backing up outside every school twice a day. 

The fact is, school buses comprise the largest mass transit system in the United States, with a fleet of 480,000 carrying approximately 26 million children to and from their daily dose of educational instruction nine months out of the year. Amazing as it sounds, it's cost effective, too; diesel-fueled buses use an estimated three billion gallons fewer than would be required to transport these kids using gas-consuming passenger cars, even though the buses average a meager 7 miles per gallon to their counterparts' 20.8 mpg. As a result, more than $7.7 million is saved annually by using buses as opposed to private vehicles, according to the American School Bus Council.

Indeed, school buses are surprisingly green, even if they are a smelly nuisance that stops in front of you every 50 feet. Thanks to advances in alternative fuels, they're getting greener and better-smelling all the time. Some districts have turned to using biodiesel blends, which combine domestically produced soybean oil, recycled cooking oil, or animal fats with 2 to 20 percent petroleum diesel. This reduces greenhouse gases while requiring few modifications to existing diesel buses. 

With stricter national emissions standards looming, many school districts are investing in new engine technologies to replace their aging fleets. Compressed liquid natural gas is gaining ground in this field, but the biggest gains in the market are being made by propane-fueled buses. They're cleaner-burning and quieter than diesel engines, although they do come with a price tag $15,000 higher than new diesel-burning models.

Blue Bird is the oldest manufacturer of school buses in the country. They began business in 1927, when most buses were still made with a wood frame. That's when Ford dealer Albert Luce decided he was going to build one off a Model T frame. Within 10 years, the company was producing all-steel buses, which became the industry standard within a short time. Nowadays, propane buses account for 20 percent of Blue Bird's business; they're identified by a green version of their usually black logo over the door. 

Since we're talking about standards and hues, did you know that school bus yellow is an actual color? It was originally referred to as National School Bus Chrome because the primary pigment was chrome yellow, which contained lead. In 1939, a professor at Columbia University named Dr. Frank Cyr organized a conference to establish school bus construction norms, including dimensions, lettering, and paint. The yellow-orange color was selected for two main reasons; it is easiest to see out of human peripheral vision and black lettering stands out on it, even in dim light. In today's lead-free paint manufacturing, it's known as National School Bus Glossy Yellow. 

As an aside, many moons ago, I bought a Harley-Davidson Sportster from a friend that was school bus yellow. It was a clunky, loud machine, burned oil by the quart, and had the suspension of a Flexible Flyer (in other words, none). The color didn't make me feel any safer, so I painted it a cool lime green, put a few thousand miles on it and sold it off in favor of a more comfortable ride.

My own memories of riding in a school bus have begun to fade, but I'll always remember the joy of bounding from my seat just as we went over a big speed bump on East Gate Road in Kinnelon. If you timed it just right, you'd experience the adrenaline rush of your stomach leaping up toward your throat, like a free, miniature roller coaster ride twice a day. Obviously, this was way before the advent of seat belts as essential safety equipment. Fun fact: New Jersey is one of just six states requiring lap belts on school buses. 

I got into my first fist fight on the school bus when I was in sixth grade, when Richie M. wouldn't stop shooting spitballs at me through a straw. After he failed to heed two warnings, I walked up the aisle and popped him one on the chest. We managed to rip each other's shirts in the ensuing scuffle and earned three days' detention as a result, during which time we became good friends.

So while you're sitting in traffic, staring at reflective tape and sneakered feet through the rear emergency door window, take a moment to reflect on your own school bus experiences. If you're honest, you'll probably feel compelled to cut the person behind the wheel some serious slack, and that is as it should be.. Going green the practical way. Sep 3, 2015 by Sean Kilcarr in Trucks at Work RSS EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 I’ve recently discussed in this space how efforts to “go green” – in other words be more “environmentally conscious” – can get bogged down over cost, and rightly so. Certainly, using less energy, reducing landfill waste, and switching to alternatively fueled vehicles (AFVs) are just some of the many “earth-friendly” strategies out there. But if they end up hiking the operating budgets of both families and businesses, they won’t be viewed as being very “friendly” and will face all sorts of resistance. Trucking has experienced all of this first-hand, starting with the nearly decade-long imposition of exhaust emission reduction rules and now with fuel economy mandates. Yet lost in all the pencil-pushing by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory bodies (notably the California Air Resources Board or “CARB”) is that if you leave businesses – and especially fleets – alone, by and large, they’ll come with effective “green” solutions on their own that simultaneously reduce their costs as well. Take Time Warner Cable, for example:   The company saved 267 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) by recycling 100% of unused copper, 95% of cardboard and 75% of Styrofoam and packaging materials. That’s 76.04 metric tons of copper, cardboard and wood pallets diverted from landfills in 2013 alone. TWC also made Ford Motor Co.’s Fusion Hybrid its standard passenger car, achieving a 33% increase in fuel efficiency and saving a future estimate of 30,000 gallons of gasoline and 210 tons of CO2e monthly. The company’s fleet is also witching to new Ford Transit and F-150 pickups to boost fuel savings further. For example, it’s replaced 173 NYC vans with new Transit Connects, saving 553 gallons of fuel or some $2,245 and 5.35 tons of carbon per month. TWC and 14 other cable, satellite and telephone companies and vendors put into effect a voluntary five-year “set-top box energy conservation agreement” back in 2012. It’s expected to result in annual residential electricity savings across the Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) industry of $1.5 billion or more by the end of 2017. Altogether, TWC’s “Go Green” initiatives chopped the company’s “carbon intensity” by 38% over the past two years, far exceeding its goal of a 15% reduction set in 2012. I chatted with George Survant, TWC’s senior director of fleet management, recently via email about the role vehicle selection and specification plays in achieving such goals – the basic “blocking and tackling” assignment of fleet managers everywhere. TWC, by the way, operates more than 20,600 active vehicles, 50% of which are vans, with the fleet adding more than 400 diesel-powered full-size Transit vans and 200 compact Transit Connect vans in recent years That diesel engine changeup for its full-size Transit models is a big fuel saver, by the way, reducing overall fuel consumption by 47%. “Diesel engines develop significantly higher levels of torque at lower engine speeds, so a lower RPM operating condition for our engines can produce as much work as a gasoline engine operating at a higher RPM,” Survant explained. That, of course, saves fuel – and less fuel burned not only means spending less money but fewer tailpipe emissions as well, don’t you know. TWC is also adding Ford’s new aluminum F-150 pickup to its fleet –purchasing more than 540 4x2 versions of that light truck equipped with 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 engines. Again, the reasoning is pretty simple. The aluminum construction of Ford’s revamped F-150 makes it about 700 lbs. lighter than the model it’s replacing, thus helping reduce fuel consumption. The small-block 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6, which produces 325 hp and 375 lb.-ft. of torque, also helps improve the fuel economy footprint for TWC’s fleet. That engine still gives those pickups significant payload – some 2,250 lbs. – and towing capability, some 8,500 lbs., which is enough to meet about 90% of TWC’s fleet needs. Yet it also helps those pickups achieve about 19 mpg city, 26 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined compared to the truck’s 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Now, this is not an “instantaneous” upgrade by any means, as Survant said TWC normally transitions roughly 10% of its fleet annually. Then again, that’s the most cost-effective way to do it – ensuring that the company gets the most value out of the vehicles it already operates before bringing in new models. “We’re committed to reducing our impact on the environment,” Survant said. “Energy and fuel efficiency are very important to us as we continue our efforts to ensure the TWC fleet is environmentally-friendly.” And that’s friendlier on the company‘s wallet, too.

More about Cars , Tech , Transportation , Ford , and Trucks. Badge of dishonour. ALMOST as soon as governments began testing vehicle emissions, auto makers found ways to cheat. ALMOST as soon as governments began testing vehicle emissions, auto makers found ways to cheat. In the 1970s some cars were found to be rigged with ""defeat devices"" that turned off the emission systems when the airconditioning was turned on. Others had sensors that activated pollution controls only at the temperature regulators used during the tests.

""The concept of a defeat device has always been there, because there's such an incentive for the manufacturers to cheat on the emissions tests,"" said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety. Volkswagen ""took it to another level of sophisticated deception we've never seen before"".

The scandal now engulfing VW, which has admitted to outfitting cars with software designed to give false readings on emission tests, is unique both for its size and digital complexity. But it's not the first emissions-cheating case, even for the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company.

On July 23, 1973, the Environmental Protection Agency accused the auto maker of installing defeat devices in cars it wanted to sell in the 1974 model year. VW then admitted it had sold 1973 model year cars with the devices, which consisted of temperature-sensing switches that cut out pollution controls at low temperatures.

The EPA suspected VW sold 25,000 vehicles with the cheating technology. Then-attorney general Elliot Richardson took the company to court for violating the Clean Air Act. They settled with a $US120,000 fine without admitting any wrongdoing.

""Our relations with the EPA are too important to permit us to become involved in an adversary proceeding on a matter of questionable significance,"" VW said at the time, explaining why it paid the penalty.

General Motors agreed in 1995 to pay $US45 million after being accused of circumventing pollution controls on 470,000 Cadillac luxury sedans. The cars' 4.9-litre V8 engines were tuned to turn off pollution controls when the airconditioning ran, the EPA said at the time.

The government alleged the engines, which were installed from the 1991 through to 1995 model years, ended up releasing 90,000 tonnes of excess carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. GM disagreed, saying it was paying the fine as part of a conciliatory approach to dispose of enforcement cases more quickly.

""We strongly disagree with the allegations made by the federal government,"" GM said at the time. ""This is a matter of interpretation of current regulations regarding the complex issue of off-cycle emissions.""

Besides agreeing to cover $US25 million in recall, GM paid an $US11 million fine and agreed to spend $US9 million in ""corporate community service"". To help the cause of cleaner air, the Detroit-based auto maker agreed to buy back older, more polluting cars and provide school districts with buses powered by batteries or natural gas.

The EPA says VW has admitted to using defeat devices in the 482,000 cars now under investigation in the US. The agency says the device built into the cars sensed when they were being tested on a dynamometer. During those times, the car uses an emission-control system that traps nitrogen oxide, a key ingredient in smog. When the car senses it is on the road, it cuts back on the emission control - releasing from 10 to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxide.

""It takes a very savvy program to fool the computer and detect the sophisticated test cycle,"" said Stanley Young, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, which is also investigating VW. ""This was clearly well thought out and took a lot of programming.

""Engines these days are very complicated,"" he said. ""So there is a sophisticated and powerful computer inside all cars, and that was where this algorithm, this 'second routine,' was embedded.""

VW could be fined as much as $US18 billion and may have to recall and fix the cars in the US. European authorities are conducting their own investigation, as are those in South Korea, which could result in further penalties.

VW has apologised for the cheating and vowed to earn back the trust of consumers. Chief executive officer Martin Winterkorn quit on Wednesday, saying the company needs a fresh start.

The current VW case resembles a 1998 case involving seven manufacturers of heavy-duty truck engines: Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Mack Trucks, Navistar International Transportation Corp, Renault Vehicules Industriels, and Volvo Truck Corp.

The companies agreed to spend more than $US1 billion, including $US83.4 million in penalties, to settle the case - the biggest civil fine to that point for violating an environmental law. Then-attorney general Janet Reno cautioned the industry that ""an ounce of compliance is worth a pound of penalties"".

As with VW, the truck-engine makers used software to alter pollution control technology under highway driving conditions. The engines met emissions limits when they ran on the EPA's 20- minute federal test procedure. On real-world highways, they spewed up to three times the legal limit for nitrogen oxide, regulators said. The result was 1.3 million tons of excess nitrogen oxide in 1998 alone.

The industry agreed to spend more than $US850 million to accelerate the development of cleaner engines, to rebuild older engines and recall pick-up trucks that were equipped with defeat devices.

Also in 1998, the Justice Department and the EPA settled a $US267 million case with Honda and a separate $US7.8 million case with Ford for selling cars with systems designed to defeat emissions control.

Last year, Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp agreed to pay the equivalent of $US350 million in fines, forfeited credits and certification testing to settle US claims that they overstated fuel economy on the window stickers car buyers see at dealer showrooms. The companies tested cars only at optimal temperatures and used the best results rather than averages, according to the EPA. The inflated mileage claims affected 1.2 million vehicles sold in the US.

""Hyundai has acted transparently, reimbursed affected customers and fully co-operated with the EPA throughout the course of this investigation,"" David Zuchowski, president and chief executive officer of Hyundai Motor America, said at the time. ""We are pleased to put this behind us.""

The Korean auto makers agreed in 2012 to compensate consumers for the misleading mileage claims by issuing debit cards to affected customers. The rating on the Kia Soul's window sticker was lowered by 6 miles per gallon, and most of Hyundai and Kia's other US models were adjusted down by 1 or 2 miles per gallon.

Ford had to lower its fuel-efficiency estimates for certain models twice in less than a year, citing a computer-modelling error. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company sent out payments ranging from $US200 to $US1050 to pay 200,000 customers last year. Bloomberg News. How GM and Ford Could Benefit From Volkswagen's Woes. Earlier this year, Volkswagen became the top automaker in the world by sales volume. But the German auto giant has become enmeshed in a massive scandal this month, after it admitted to using software to cheat on U.S. emissions tests for its diesel cars. 
 
The fallout has already included the resignation of Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn, a halt to sales of certain models in the U.S., and a $7.3 billion reserve to cover potential fines, recalls, and the cost of rebuilding Volkswagen's reputation. Volkswagen stock has plunged by about 30% since these revelations hit the news. 
 

 
Volkswagen's emissions scandal could have a devastating impact on its earnings. Photo: The Motley Fool. 
 
Shares of other automakers, including General Motors  ( NYSE:GM ) and Ford  ( NYSE:F ) , have also been pulled down by the Volkswagen scandal. However, the two top U.S. automakers could actually benefit from Volkswagen's growing headaches. 
 
Diesel isn't a focus for GM and Ford 
Volkswagen's admission that its ""clean diesel"" cars aren't really so clean could significantly damage consumer perception of diesel cars across all automakers. That's one reason other automakers' stocks have fallen as the VW crisis has spiraled out of control. 
 
General Motors and Ford have taken tentative steps to compete with VW and other European brands in the diesel car market in recent years. But they hardly sell any diesel cars in the U.S. -- and even in Europe, they are not as exposed to the diesel market as Volkswagen. 
 
So while demand for diesel cars may drop in the near term, this will have a limited impact on both GM and Ford. Moreover, most of the people who would have bought a diesel car will still need to buy some kind of vehicle. That's the real opening for GM and Ford. 
 
A small opportunity in the U.S. 
GM and Ford hold the top two market share spots in the U.S. auto market, combining for more than 30% of U.S. vehicle sales. That puts them in position to capture a good portion of the consumers who may be fleeing Volkswagen now. 
 
That said, the opportunity is relatively small. Volkswagen simply hasn't done that well in the U.S., with sales of its namesake brand totaling about 367,000 vehicles last year. (Its upscale Audi brand accounts for another roughly 200,000 vehicles.) By comparison, GM and Ford each sell millions of cars and trucks every year in the United States. 
 
Europe is the key 
Europe might be a bigger opportunity, though. Volkswagen Group accounted for more than 25% of the European auto market in 2014, with roughly half of that total coming from the namesake VW brand. By contrast, GM and Ford combined held less than 15% of the market. 
 
Both American automakers are in the midst of long-running turnaround plans in Europe after losing billions of dollars in the region. Both companies have done a good job of cutting costs by shutting smaller factories and consolidating production into larger facilities. Nevertheless, they are relying on sales gains to reach sustainable profitability in Europe. 
 

 
GM and Ford are relying on new products to drive sales gains in Europe. Photo: Ford Motor Company. 
 
Thus far, they've had mixed results. Ford has had to scrap its initial target of reaching breakeven in Europe by 2015. GM is holding onto a goal of being profitable in Europe next year, but it has acknowledged in recent months that it will be difficult to reach that target, primarily because of the sharp downturn in the Russian auto market. 
 
Yet if the backlash against Volkswagen -- and diesel fuel, more generally -- spreads to Europe, it could give GM and Ford the advantage they need to gain momentum there. In a case of good timing, GM's Opel subsidiary updated its Corsa subcompact less than a year ago, debuted a new city car (the Opel Karl) earlier in 2015, and a redesigned Astra will hit dealer lots soon. 
 
The Corsa and Astra together account for half of Opel's sales volume, so sales gains in those segments could have a meaningful impact on Opel's overall performance. And GM's new models are all very fuel-efficient: even with gasoline engines. 
 
Meanwhile, Ford has also bet on keeping products fresh in order to boost sales. A redesigned version of its Mondeo midsize car (a close cousin of the Ford Fusion) has been selling well over the past year, while a plethora of new SUVs are coming, starting with the Ford Edge. 
 
Just what they needed 
The European auto market is fiercely competitive, and GM and Ford haven't fared too well in that competition recently. But the biggest winner there has been Volkswagen. With the market leader suddenly hobbled, other brands' plans to gain market share suddenly seem a lot more plausible. 
 
GM and Ford have a variety of strong products that have either already arrived in Europe or are coming soon. If some former Volkswagen customers in Europe start to look at other options, both American automakers should be able to pick up some market share -- which could finally get their European operations back in the black. 
 
The next billion-dollar iSecret  
The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here .. Flying with Ford Falcons. On this day in 1959, Henry Ford II staged a 21-city news conference via closed-circuit television. During the broadcast, Ford unveiled “the easiest car in the world to own.” It was the automaker’s newest model, the Falcon. 

Boasting a more compact form, the four-door sedan had a 90 hp motor that gave the vehicle up to 30 miles per gallon of gas. This “new size Ford” was intended as a rival to smaller European makes such as Volkswagen, Triumph and Fiat. According to history.com, foreign-car sales in the United States had jumped 1,060 percent since 1954 and accounted for about 10 percent of the nation’s new-car sales. 

Part of the attraction to foreign cars was that they were inexpensive. The Falcon coming in at roughly $1,900 was far more expensive than almost all of its European competitors — a Fiat (the cheapest) cost about $1,000. 

Detroit thought that the Falcon would herald a new era of more “sensible automobiles.” Thus making the tall-finned behemoths of the late 1950s obsolete. While Ford went on to sell more than a million Falcons in the first two years, Americans were hardly tired of their large, overpowered cars. As history.com reports, today small cars make up less than 20 percent of the domestic market. 

Of all the details surrounding the development of the Falcon, one stands out: the gas mileage — 30 miles per gallon. This then begs the question as to why American automakers today still gnash their teeth and decry the tyranny of slowly increased fuel efficiency standards. 

If Ford could make a car in 1959 that got 30 MPG, why do modern automakers act like fuel efficient fleet standards are an impossible goal? 

Of course we could recall Chevrolet’s zero-emissions EV-1 from the mid 1990s. It was a popular vehicle that many contend was purposely sabotaged by the fossil fuel industry. It was in production only three years. Then there’s the self-censor Honda offering, the hybrid electric Insight. The first generation of this vehicle achieved an Environmental Protection Agency certified rating of 70 MPG highway and 53 MPG combined. This model was produced from 1999 to 2006. Honda replaced it in 2009 with a second generation that only achieved 40 MPG. It too, was killed in 2014. 

There are of course a few exceptions. The oddly shaped Toyota Prius has been a long lived crowd favorite. Current models boast 51 MPG city. 

Sure, Americans love their big cars, but more than a half century has elapsed since Detroit started thinking seriously about fuel economy. If we compare automobile fuel efficiency to other technological paces we get a grim result. 

In the 1970s Intel co-founder Gordon Moore articulated what has become known as Moore’s law. In 1965, Gordon Moore made a prediction that would set the pace for our modern digital revolution. He stated that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the integrated circuit was invented. Moore theorized that this trend would continue for the foreseeable future. 

History has shown Moore to be ostensibly correct. This is why we can now make phone calls with a pocket-sized super computer. 

If we held the auto industry to the same yardstick, their mass market fleet fuel efficiencies are the equivalent of computing with a 1970s Radio Shack TRS-80 desktop. Detroit has the technology to do better. It should.. Here are some of worst car scandals in history. Volkswagen’s faked diesel emissions testing led to the resignation of Martin Winterkorn as Volkswagen AG chief executive officer, and it’s prompted global outrage. But the scandal is just one of a long line of spectacular automotive disasters. 
 
From the 1960s on, some of the most popular, esteemed auto giants have been embroiled in controversy and lawsuits as investigations — by the media and regulators — linked engineering and safety problems to injuries and deaths. Regulators have steadily added tough safety, emissions and fuel efficiency standards, and in the U.S., class-action lawsuits that have yielded big judgments is putting additional pressure on auto companies. 
 
Automakers in the U.S. are responsible for conducting their own emissions tests , albeit according to government standards, and submitting the results. In Europe, automakers choose third parties to conduct the tests. But non-governmental organizations and universities can conduct independent probes, which in the case of VW led to the Environmental Protection Agency looking into the matter. 
 
Though automakers often complain that U.S. regulations have grown too stringent, history shows that compliance typically comes due to the discovery of defects and problems that are reported by consumer testing and quality organizations such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, J.D. Power & Associates and Consumer Reports. Some media attention also helps. 
 
Here are some of the most spectacular automotive crises in U.S. history: 
 
Chevrolet Corvair 
 
Perhaps the granddaddy of all automotive scandals. It also led to Ralph Nader becoming a household name. In 1965, Nader published his devastating book, Unsafe at Any Speed , in which he detailed how General Motors's penny-pinching caused the Corvair to be unsafe. GM wouldn’t spend the extra money to make the swing-axle rear suspension more stable. Nader also revealed that the Corvair had a single-piece steering column that could impale the driver in a collision. GM responded by hiring private detectives to destroy Nader’s reputation. Nader sued, won a settlement and used part of it to set up a Center for Auto Safety. James Roche, the automaker's president, was compelled to apologize for the behavior before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. 
 
Ford Pinto 
 
Ford Motor Co. built more than three million Pintos in the 1970s, a smaller, lighter car meant to be economical in the face of soaring energy prices (and Japanese competitors). Pinto became a subject of controversy after Mother Jones magazine exposed that it was prone to deadly fires in rear-end collisions ; Ford’s internal documents showed the company knew of the potential problem but chose not to fix it, calculating that it would be cheaper to pay out possible injury claims. Following the deaths of three teenage girls in Indiana, Ford was indicted for negligent homicide — although the company was acquitted. In 1978 Ford initiated a recal l to install a new part to the filler cap and other parts to deflect contact in the event of a rear-end collision. In more recent years, doubts have been cast as to how severe this defect actually was, notes Popular Mechanics. 
 
Ford Explorer\/Firestone 
 
Back in 2000, when more than a 100 people died in Ford Explorers , many of them equipped with Firestone tires, there was a national debate over large sport-utility vehicles and whether they were prone to rollover. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration pointed the finger at Firestone tires, some of which reportedly had a tendency to shred. Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires. Ford in 2001 ousted its chief executive officer , Jacques Nasser. 
 
Toyota 
 
In 2009, a California Highway Patrol Officer was driving a Lexus sedan when the car lost control; he and his family died in the crash. National coverage followed, and Toyota issued several recalls, assuring customers that it was addressing the “root cause:” floor mat entrapment. But the automaker later admitted it was hiding a problem with “sticky pedals,” the accelerators getting stuck at partially depressed levels, and it also was minimizing the scope of the floor mat entrapment. 
 
In 2014, Toyota also paid a whopping $1.2 billion fine, the largest ever paid by an automaker, to avoid criminal prosecution; as part of the settlement, Toyota admitted that it “ misled U.S. consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements.” 
 
General Motors Co. 
 
Faulty ignition switches on Chevrolet Cobalts and other models built during the last decade have been linked to the deaths of at least 124 people. Congressional testimony and investigations by the company and regulators revealed that GM engineers knew of the faulty switch for at least a decade, but a series of errors led to affected vehicles being recalled only in 2014. Earlier this month, GM paid a massive $900 million fine to settle federal criminal charges in connection with the defect. The company admitted to misleading the government, and GM will monitored for its safety practices over the next few years. 
 
Takata airbags 
 
The Japanese manufacturer of airbags has recalled airbags in some 19.2 million vehicles in the U.S. due to a tendency of the device to deploy with too much force, sending metal scraps flying into the passenger cabin. Eight deaths and about 100 injuries in the U.S. have been attributed to the defect. According to a New York Times report , Honda, one of the companies using the bags, and Takata knew about the dangerous airbags for years before disclosing it to the public and issuing recalls. In early September, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that its investigation is expanding to include a wider range of airbag types made by Takata. 
 
 . Investors don't care much about huge auto recalls. Volkswagen shares slid more than 34 percent this week following news that the German automaker would stop selling its ""clean diesel"" cars in the U.S. Last week, environmental regulators  accused the company  of installing software to evade emissions standards. 
 
Monday was the biggest one-day drop for VW (XETRA: VOW3-DE) since February 2009, and losses amounted to about  $15 billion in market value  . That's some amazing movement, especially considering that it's about 482,000 cars in the U.S. that are involved in the alleged misdeeds. 
 
Data show that VW's drop is unusual for automakers involved in big recalls. A Big Crunch analysis suggests that investors in the past decades have not been significantly bothered by market fears associated with auto recalls. 
 
Overall, there isn't a pattern of losses or gains in the first 30 days after a recall report is filed in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration database. Automakers tended to be down a year afterward. 
 
Of course, the market often moves independently of major recalls. If we adjust for the movement of the indexed S&P 500 (INDEX: .SPX) , the average change after a recall is close to nothing—and there is little evidence of investors' dumping their stocks immediate before or after a recall campaign is made public. 
 
The biggest recall in U.S. history was of 21 million Ford (NYSE: F) and Mercury vehicles in 1981. The cars and light trucks had faulty parking brakes that would indicate that they were engaged but would not actually work. The share price fell just 7 percent in the month following the recall's announcement and 15 percent over the year. 
 
To repeat, that's 21 million vehicles recalled and a 15 percent drop over 12 months. Nothing like a 34 percent drop in two days over less than half a million potentially recalled cars. 
 
Ford's share price rebounded and more than tripled over the five years after the massive recall. 
 
Ford also saw the opposite—their share price leap after a large recall. In 2009, the company recalled 4.5 million vehicles of Ford and Mercury models with faulty wiring. A Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) -made speed control deactivation switch could overheat and catch fire, something that could happen whether or not the car was actually running at the time. 
 
Ford's share price leapt 17.6 percent in a month of trading following the recall announcement. A year later, the stock had increased 91 percent in value. 
 

While the approximately 482,000 VW and Audi cars in the U.S. affected by the EPA's allegations are far fewer than the millions recalled in the largest campaigns, the costs could be far greater. 
     . VW's stock slid 20 percent on news of the latest car recall. But data show the 10  …   
In the quest to create ""clean diesel"" cars with both high fuel efficiency and low emissions, VW seems to have found a short-cut: cheating. According to EPA documents , the company admitted to using software to game emissions tests, keeping emissions within legal limits during laboratory conditions but exceeding them by as much as 35 times out on the road. 
 
The understandably irate EPA has the power to fine the company as much as $18 billion—more than six times the company's net profit in 2014. Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg reported Monday that VW was under a criminal investigation by the Justice Department in association with skirting the emissions testing. On Tuesday, VW acknowledged another 11 million diesel cars worldwide were installed with the same software. Some 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) have been set aside to deal with the cleanup, VW said in a statement. 
 
And the damage isn't a one-time problem. Not only could the company's reputation be seriously harmed, but the company has thousands of TDI clean diesel cars that can't be sold. Those models accounted for 22 percent of Volkswagen of America sales last year.

More From CNBC. Comparison “Test”: 1968 Oldsmobile Cutlass S and 1968 Ford Mustang GT. Confession time: I've never driven a car built before the 1980s. Actually, scratch that. I may have driven a car built before the '80s — likely late '70s — but it wasn't memorable enough for me to actually, well, remember. Thankfully, my hobby-turned-career has afforded certain pleasures, such as driving two incredible examples of what Detroit had to offer the buying public more than 40 years ago. It was time to right my dark secret. These two cars — a 1968 Ford Mustang GT and an Oldsmobile Cutlass S of the same vintage — would allow me to do just that. The Contenders
If you are looking for a head-to-head, take-no-prisoners comparison test of two affordable classics, you might want to click away — there are quotes around Test in the headline for a reason. Instead, this is about two everyday heros: The Mustang is of Hollywood provenance while its opponent, an Oldsmobile Cutlass S, is of commoner origins. Kevin MacDonald, the owner of the 1968 Ford Mustang GT, assures me his car is an original GT and not a clone. (Disclosure: I'm inclined to believe him without digging through his papers. I've known him long enough to recall he was the proud owner of a World Wrestling Federation action figure collection as a child, along with other embarrassing secrets.) The car is a former Hollywood star car, though it wasn't this well dressed when it graced the silver screen. In the 2005 remake ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" Ethan Hawke drove this very Mustang when it looked a little worse for wear. While you can't see it clearly in this scene from the movie (below), the Mustang's fenders were painted along the wheel wells with primer (on top of the paint) to make it look like it had a recent — or long forgotten — rust repair. Now, that same car looks primed for a spot in a Haggerty commercial. (And, just so you know, Kevin is my age. That makes him a Millennial. There's still hope.) While this GT is an original, many of its parts are not, making this Mustang fit in as a moderate restomod. For starters, instead of the old three-speed manual, this car is now home to a T-5 five-speed manual gearbox mated to its original 302 V-8. A 600 Edelbrock carburetor, long tube headers and Flowmaster exhaust make sure it will be heard as it blows past you on the freeway. Its Vista Blue paint — a circa-2006 shade instead of the original Acapulco Blue — ensures its image will be burned into your retinas well after it's been lost to the horizon. The Mustang's 302 powerplant has accumulated 40,000 miles in its 47 years of service, but it's still as spritely as it was when it came off the line in Dearborn. The Cutlass S is certainly the more relaxed of the two cars and comes with an equally interesting — but maybe less impressive to non-enthusiasts — story of its own. The Cutlass' current owner, Greg Beaulieu, had been hunting for a winter beater in 1993 when he stumbled upon an ill-conceived ad for the car in a local Auto Trader. After checking out a Volkswagen Fox, '75 Chrysler New Yorker 2-door, and an '80s vintage four-cylinder Mustang, Greg test drove a pristine '76 Buick Regal. ""(The Regal) was in perfect condition, drove really well, but the emissions-choked Buick V-8 had no power worth speaking about,"" Greg said. ""In fact, I had to look under the hood to confirm it was a Buick 350 and not a V-6."" After that, Greg dug deeper in the classifieds. Again and again, month after month, he saw an ad for a '68 Oldsmobile Cutlass S with 28,000 miles. Accompanying the ad was a solitary, dark photo that ""did (the Cutlass) no favors,"" said Greg. Asking price: $6,000. It turns out the Oldsmobile was owned by a long-serving secretary who'd recently come on bad health. The then-owner's brother explained the Cutlass had hardly been driven in years, but that it was a good car and Greg should make a visit to check it out. ""It was covered in dust, the paint was dull, it had some crappy bodywork done to it, and it was wearing bias-ply tires with snows on the back."" Greg still took it for a test drive. Lacking the emissions controls that saddled the '76 Regal, the Cutlass made full use of its 350 Rocket and two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission. ""The drive was fun,"" Greg explained, ""but not for $6,000."" Upon returning home, Greg offered the then-owner's brother $3,000 for the car. ""'I'll take it',"" Greg recounted the man saying. ""He wanted it gone, and was tired of having to deal with it. I wished I had said $2,000 — but I had bought myself a car."" Due to neglect, the Olds' oil had gone grey and was replaced immediately along with the filter. Ignition parts — distributor cap, rotor and points — were also replaced. Oldsmobile SSII-styled steel wheels were sourced, wrapped with white letter T\/A rubber, and fitted to the car. However, the Cutlass' big makeover item was paint. Greg transformed the classic from dreary turquoise to a bright, period-correct shade of red. ""My winter beater was suddenly too nice to be a beater."" Since then, Greg has owned the car for 22 years and he's accumulated 22,000 additional miles on the car. And even with the work he did to the car when he first bought it, it's still a project and not just a cruiser. ""This winter I had the front seat upholstery and floor carpet renewed. At some point in the next while I'll have the front end rebuilt and convert it to disk brakes up front. A three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 350 transmission sits in my garage waiting to be rebuilt and installed to replace the original 2-speed Jetaway. Someday."" Involved, not separated
""I need to teach you how to drive the car first,"" Greg said to me before setting out on a short drive where he was at the wheel. ""Really? It's a car, right? It can't be that difficult,"" I replied. While he sat in the driver's seat, Greg instructed me to hold down the accelerator pedal slightly when turning the key. ""If it doesn't start right away when you do that, floor it."" As he'd anticipated my arrival, the Oldsmobile was already warmed up. Greg turned the key with his foot slightly depressing the throttle, the Cutlass came to life, and we pulled out of his driveway. Not two blocks away from his home, while sitting at a stop sign, the looks from passersby — whether conveyed by vehicles or by their own God-given feet — were of amazement. The Cutlass S didn't wear 4-4-2 badges or sport a convertible top. In 1968, this car would have been a common sight — but that didn't matter today. In 2015, this Olds is exotic. Thumbs were up'd. Fingers were pointed. Hands were waved. In this car, you are connected with all those around you through a constant stream of real-life Facebook likes and Twitter favorites. * * * * * ""What's that smell?"" I asked. ""What smell?"" Greg answered the question with a question. ""It's kind of musty. Organic. I don't know how to describe it."" However, I knew exactly how to describe it. It smelled like, well, old people. Specifically, it smelled like the home owned by an elderly gentleman who lived next door when I was a tyke. Reggie was our shared neighborhood grandfather. That was perfect for me when I was young. I'd been born much too late to meet either of my grandfathers. On a fairly regular basis during the summer, Reg would provide ice cream to a few of us neighborhood kids. I think it was his way of caring for the younger ones around him, having no children of his own. He'd invite us in, put a single scoop in each bowl and hand them out to each of us along with with 40-year-old silver spoons. (I used to always wonder why Reg's spoons looked ""dirty"", but the silver was just tarnished due to age. Sometimes I would hand my spoon back to Reg and ask him why he didn't clean it properly. I feel bad about that now.) The inside of Greg's Cutlass smelled exactly like the inside of Reg's home; the aroma instantly transported me back to those summers filled with vanilla ice cream provided by our shared neighborhood grandpa. The Cutlass even featured another item shared with Reg's home — an 8-track player — that Greg had sourced after he bought the car. In Reg's home, that 8-track constantly played honky-tonk. ""Seriously, Greg, the smell is taking me back to my childhood."" ""That's funny. A lot of people say that,"" said Greg. After our ""getting acquainted"" tour, Greg released me — sans chaperone — with his Cutlass. * * * * * Our first short drive, after meeting Kevin and his Mustang, took us to Halifax by way of the MacDonald Bridge that spans Halifax Harbour. Kevin led the way as I followed his Mustang in Greg's Cutlass. With my windows down, all I could hear was Kevin's exhaust and all I could smell was unburnt fuel being shot from the rear of the Ford — or maybe through the vents on the Cutlass, not that it mattered. The turning vent windows in the Cutlass aimed the late-afternoon air, and Kevin's exhaust note, directly at my face. The gas fumes stung my nostrils with their sweetness. Normally, with a loud exhaust in the vicinity and the essence of gasoline in the air, I would roll up my windows and turn on the air conditioning — but not today. With my arm resting on the window frame of the door and my other hand steering the ship, I felt like I was transported back to 1968. I could hear, smell, and feel everything around me. As a motorcycle rider, I'm used to being more in-tune with what's happening in my immediate environment when on two wheels. This was something wholly different. I could see why driving this car — or any car like it — could make someone fall in love. And that's really the best way to explain the time I spent with Greg's Cutlass — romantic. It's bright red paint, black interior and simplistic controls were a blank canvass for me to paint my own existence atop a time when this car — and the Ford in front of me — were commonplace, and the people that owned them truly cared and loved their cars. The Cutlass didn't fit like a glove in the same sense we now use that idiom to describe a seat's ability to keep its driver in place. Instead, it fit like a friend. * * * * * Greg's advice would come in handy, more than once, as we moved the cars around to shoot them in different locales. The Olds would crank but not catch, I'd floor the pedal, and the 350 Rocket would come to life. In 1968, you really needed to know about cars to operate them. Instead of simply pushing a button, and the vehicle sensing a fob in your pocket, and an order being commanded by the computer to start the engine, it was up to you to remember each car's Konami code. It was up to you to know, from a moderately technical standpoint, how to start a car properly. * * * * * After shooting the cars, I drove Greg's Cutlass to a local gas station to fill it up with the best supreme I could find. Looking at the gas gauge on the dashboard offered no clues as to which side to fill the Olds — because there wasn't a side to fill the Olds. I made my way to the back of the car, flipped down the license plate and offered liquid essence to the 47-year-old coupe. The pleasure of problems
After the Cutlass had been returned (with a minor shedding of tears) to its rightful owner, Kevin and I returned to my home where I would take the reins of the pony car. However, there was a slight hiccup. Even though the wiper switch was firmly in the off position, the wipers were doing their best to ruin their rubbers by batting back and forth across the dry glass. Jiggling the wiper switch didn't help. ""If you don't want me to drive the car tonight, I fully understand. You should get this home,"" I said to Kevin. ""Just gimme a minute,"" he replied. That minute turned into 10, then 20, then 30. Kevin, armed with some basic tools from my garage and lacking any gumption traps that would certainly stop me in my tracks, was now taking apart the dash of the Mustang to inspect the switch. Panels were removed and the gauges were flipped up and out of the way. Kevin fiddled with some of the electrics out of my view. ""Mark, look at this."" Kevin held out his hand and dropped the wiper switch in mine. It was an original part wearing a FoMoCo stamp that did duty under the dash since it rolled off the line in Dearborn. At least, for now, the wipers would be off. After the dash was reassembled, we all piled into the Mustang. Kevin rode shotgun while our girlfriends took the back seats. I sat myself behind that big, wooden steering wheel and fired up the Mustang. Then I stopped to think about this moment — for a moment. There was something very old school in the scene besides the car itself. The boys were up front talking cars while the girls were in the back talking about whatever girls talk about. Only a convertible top, dropped down to open up the night sky to us, could have enhanced the experience. Once we got moving, the Mustang proved itself to be a raucous machine. It wanted to go — and now! The clutch, while not heavy, didn't have much travel in its engagement — like an on-off switch. Same with the throttle, though to a lesser degree. I egged on the old Ford with a tender but heavy foot, rolling into the throttle instead of stomping it to the floor. It responded in kind with lumps of torque pushing us into the bucket seats. Damn, I want to live in 1968. Attention Millennials — this is authenticity.
Let me be clear, fellow Millennials: There is nothing authentic about the modern automobile outside of some choice examples. The Mazda MX-5 Miata, the automotive journalist collective's car of choice in perpetuity, is a copy of British sports cars of yore. Today's Mustang, Camaro and Challenger come close, though the latter sits atop a cast-off Mercedes platform while it awaits something bespoke and more befitting its name and history. A current Mustang, sporting a turbocharged four-cylinder engine to make it palatable for European consumption, is little more than an idea that started in a marketing meeting before being executed by engineers. Same applies with the soon-to-be available Camaro. This experience has made me think that maybe, possibly, I have this enthusiasm aimed in the wrong direction. Why am I considering a new Charger? Why don't I just get an old one? It'll sound better. It'll drive like it's being held aloft by clouds (modern suspension engineers should really benchmark this Cutlass when it comes to ride quality). And if you are just going to drive it a couple of times a week, who cares how much it costs to fuel it up? Most importantly, a car like the ones featured here makes you really, truly love the automobile. And it makes everyone around it love automobiles, even if they swear by public transport. The Mustang and Cutlass are two very different answers to the same classic question. The Ford is eager to move and wants the chance to vulcanize Mickey Thompsons into something resembling road tar. The Oldsmobile is more laid back with its front bench seat, offering its driver and passenger to sit close together as they cruise down Main Street window shopping. Which car is for you? I know my answer. But, that's a story for another day … The post Comparison ""Test"": 1968 Oldsmobile Cutlass S and 1968 Ford Mustang GT appeared first on The Truth About Cars. from The Truth About Cars http:\/\/ift.tt\/Jh8LjA Put the internet to work for you.

(NASDAQ: TRUE), the modern car-buying service, projects the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for total light vehicle sales should reach 17.7 million units in September versus 16.5 million units a year ago, the highest in more than a decade, led by robust retail sales. 

Total new vehicle sales, including fleet deliveries, may rise 12.6 percent to 1,403,200 compared to 1,246,006 a year ago. A later-than-usual Labor Day holiday weekend shifted sales activity that typically occurs at the end of August into September, resulting in a robust double-digit increase. Retail volume may increase 13.8 percent to 1,214,400 units as consumers took advantage of model year closeout specials. 

""Labor Day and model year-end promotions combined to create an impressive outcome this month,"" said Eric Lyman, TrueCar's vice president of industry insights. ""September's sales pace underscores the strength of the auto sector's continued expansion and our confidence that full-year sales will reach 17.2 million units in 2015."" 

On a daily selling rate (DSR) basis, adjusting for one more day this month versus September 2014, sales should rise 8.1 percent. 

Sales of luxury cars and light trucks will likely grow 7.5 percent compared to a year ago. Crossover and utility vehicles remain in demand and are propelling overall industry growth. Notably, utility sales for Ford Motor Co.'s Ford division are tracking to be at the highest level in over a decade. 

Volkswagen may be an outlier this month, following news that software on the carmaker's diesel models was altered to allow the vehicles to pass emissions tests. Sales of TDI diesel models have been suspended, and the Volkswagen group's volume may fall 5.2 percent in September. 

""With 27 percent of VW sales coming in the form of TDI-equipped cars, we expect an immediate impact on the brand until the stop-sale on TDI vehicles ends,"" Lyman said. 

Subaru may be the sales leader with a 24.3 percent rise in total volume, resulting in a best-ever September for the brand. Kia Motors America follows with a 23.1 percent increase in unit sales and should also see a record September. Toyota should rank third with a 19.1 percent increase amid gains for the company's light trucks. 

Interest rates remain unchanged and overall U.S. economic conditions are still strong. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index® rebounded by 10.5 points in August, hitting 101.5. Meanwhile, the unemployment report in August was 5.1 percent, the lowest for the month in eight years. Gas prices also remain favorable, falling to a national average of $2.28 per gallon on September 23 from $3.34 a year earlier. 

Incentive spending by automakers averaged $3,090 per vehicle in September, up 3.9 percent from a year ago and down 0.1 percent from August 2015.

I've been trying to put my experience in Jamaica into words. It's the end of the summer and it's time. Since I returned from a service trip to Kingston with 7 rising seniors from Loyola Blakefield--I have written a letter a week to the amazing young men--and one incredible young woman-who not only let me be a mom for 8 days--but demonstrated physically and spiritually what it means to lift up others.  
I have one more letter to write before school starts. 
The words below are my attempt to make our experience in Jamaica stay.These are my letters to the Loyolans.

MI BELLY FULL BUT ME HUNGRY

Wha gwaan, dons!

Hope you are reaping the rewards of your service and are feeling both full and hungry in Christ.  Where have you seen God today? When you get in the habit of looking for him and seeing him--he doesn't stop revealing himself.  I got up this morning and did yoga outside and then walked to the grocery store for coffee, raisin bran, and mangoes. While in the grocery store, Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground"" was playing, so I stopped for a minute to listen to the lyrics.

Teachers keep on teachin'
Preachers keep on preachin'
World keep on turnin'
Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

Lovers keep on lovin'
Believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

I'm so glad that he let me try it again
Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground...



I just stood there—thinking about Jamaica—and how it felt like higher ground and then I heard someone say hello.  It was a former student of mine.  At 8AM in the Safeway. Coincidence…I think not.

Later in the morning, I had to run to the MVA to check that my registration wasn’t suspended because I forgot to take my car in for an emissions test.  I returned home to some mail that said my registration was suspended!  I drove my black soul to the MVA, blaring Bob Marley with the windows down and found a parking spot out front.  When I was about to go in—I saw a man with a black Rastafari cap covering a head full of dreads sitting on a bench.  “I heard you jammin’” he said through yellowed teeth.  I told him I had just gotten back from Jamaica.  We talked for a bit and then I went inside to wait in line.  I got to the front of the line in tree minutes.  The woman at the counter was so pleasant and sweet and told me that my registration was fine.  I was in and out of the MVA in five minutes. Five minutes in the MVA!  Now that’s island time!

I won’t go through the entire play by play of my day—but know I’ve been thinking of all of you—and wondering how you are sharing Jamaica with others—through your stories and through your actions.

Tonight I’m making Rice and Mushrooms and Chicken in Barbecue Sauce from the cookbook I got at the craft fair, Jamaican Cookery: Recipies from Old Jamaican Grandmothers. I’m blaring Bob Marley and picked up a few Red Stripes.  I invited Ms. Kurtzman over, but she had to work.

How are you living out Jamaica?

I just wanted to remind you of some abstract and concrete next steps…


   •       Stay in touch! (Ben—thanks for setting up the flickr.)
   •       Take the time to share your Jamaica experience in a way that allows you the time and REESPEKT that the trip deserves.  As Peter said—the best way to do it is over coffee or lunch.
  •       Continue to journal—our trip didn’t end…it’s just beginning—take the time to be alone with your thoughts to continue to process this experience.
  •       Download the bible app. (I personally recommend The Message translation. Follow the readings listed in St. Theresa’s church bulletin.)
  •       Think about what Jamaica club will look like for the school year—the possibilities are endless!
  •       Tune into 88.9FM on Saturday mornings. Trust me on this one.
  •       Give everyone you meet a little bit of heaven!

For those of you not on the bus home—NO ONE will be reading your journals. (Ben—I didn’t read yours. I’ll return it to you when I see you next.) Ms. Szzz said they are yours to keep.

I’ll send out an email later in the week with some dates regarding a Jamaica reunion.  Some thoughts were…Free yoga in the city, followed by church in Federal Hill (Ms. Christ’s church, Ms. Kurtzman’s neighborhood), food at Abbey Burger (owned by Loyola grads) or Cross Street Market, followed by an Oriole game. Think about if any and\/or all of those things sound good to you.  I'll also send you the list of memories we brainstormed along with Peter's email address.

I’ll leave you with my favorite Bob Marley song of all time…Mellow Mood.  It ties into my favorite verse in the bible.  Proverbs 27:17 As iron sharpens iron, one man sharpens another.  Thank you for sharpening me this week.

PS.  There was a dead bird in my basement when I got home. I guess it was a welcome home present from my cat, George Bailey.  It's a wonderful life!

PIXIE DUST, MOVEMENT OF JAH PEOPLE

Wha gwaan, Dons!
How has your week been?  I hope you are continuing to see things differently this first week back to reality.  I hope you are taking Peter’s advice and have been unplugging from technology when you can.  A week without it can change your pace and change your thinking.  It certainly has for me. 
I’ve been reading a book—Still Life With Woodpecker—it’s part fantasy, part fairytale, part love story that reveals the purpose of the moon, explains the difference between criminals and outlaws, examines the conflict between social activism and romantic individualism, and paints a portrait of contemporary society that includes powerful Arabs, exiled royalty, and pregnant cheerleaders.  It also deals with the problem of redheads. (No disrespect, Tim!)
The basic premise of the book revolves around one question---how do you make love stay? I find it beautifully fitting considering our amazing experience and our commission to take Jamaica with us and keep it alive in our hearts.  Here’s one of my favorite sentences from the book so far…”What we have here is a touchdown on the runway of the heart.” 
Continue to think about where Jamaica touched down in your heart. While we experienced Jamaica as a community—we also experienced it individually.  What it means for me is different for what it means for you.  I challenge you to continue to explore the way that the experience affected you with two specific questions:
·       What will you do that is different?·       What will you do that is the same?
Maybe you’ve been stuck inside with these recent storms.  Use your down time this summer to continue to reflect.  Summer is my favorite time of year. It’s a time to refresh and recharge. Take your experiences in Jamaica with you as you reboot for one incredible senior year.
I’ve had many coffee, breakfast, lunch, and dinner dates this week.  I’ve been talking about all of you and how much I learned from you.  Thank you for helping me to kick off one amazing summer. 
Meetings with Mr. Maranaicci and Ms. Szzz have surfaced the idea of an end of summer service cookout—a time for those involved in service trips to share stories with other dons and their families in a low-key, informal setting.  Think cookout in Xavier, cornhole, KANJAM, Frisbee, or soccer in the hollow—ending with student speakers from each summer trip.  We are thinking of having Fr. Steggert or Fr. Joe hold a Sunday evening mass in the chapel—followed by food, fellowship, and fun.  This will probably take place right before we get back to school.  More details will follow.
If you are seeking more opportunities to serve this summer in Baltimore, consider volunteering at SHARPkids summer camp.  The camp is looking for volunteers Monday-Thursday from 1-3PM.  You would be working with elementary school students in the Sharp Leadenhall community—a few blocks from Cross Street Market in Federal Hill.  You would be rotating between helping students with math, reading, and freeplay.  The dons involved in the Baltimore service trip will be volunteering with SHARPkids and I know Ms. Szzz would be happy to have you tag along.  I’ll be volunteering at the camp on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The camp runs for the month of July.  One of the reasons I love this camp so much is that one of its aims is to get the elementary school boys on track to get into St. Ignatius Loyola Academy for Middle School---and from there---who knows. I love working with the boys knowing that one day they might be sitting in my English class.  There are also amazing elementary school girls for you to work with—God knows the effect you guys have on the girls.  These girls are just as amazing and inspiring as the girls in Jamaica.  All it takes is your willingness to get on their level.  Baltimore girls know how to whip and nay nay too, Will.
Ok—I can get a little long winded—and I also like to write—so sorry if this is going on too long.  I’ll wrap it up with some final thoughts.
·       Consider volunteering at SHARPkids summer camp. It can be a way to take our short term service into long term service. SHARPkids runs all through the school year from 3-6PM.  You might make a connection with a student and still be able to see him\/her all school year long.  Come one afternoon in July from 1-3PM.  See what you think.  https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SHARPkidshttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SHARPkids
·       Check out a new church. As we experienced—it’s great to get out of your comfort zone and see how different communities worship the Lord.  Sadly, Sunday mornings can be one of the most segregated times of our week.  Grace City in Baltimore is very deliberate about making sure its congregation reflects the kingdom of God.  There’s even a Jamaican flag hanging in the sanctuary. http:\/\/www.gracecitybaltimore.org\/http:\/\/www.gracecitybaltimore.org\/


·       Find Peter on Facebook. Look up Jamaica Volunteer Foundation and you’ll see photos from previous trips.  There’s a picture of a young man shaving one of the men Dennis also shaved. https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Jamaica-Volunteer-Foundation\/216913978326494?fref=ts
·       Let’s plan a Jamaica Reunion. On Saturday, July 11 there is a Caribbean Carnival in Baltimore.  It starts with a parade and is followed by a festival with bands, food, music, and crafts.  We can carpool from Loyola. http:\/\/baltimorecarnival.com  We also mentioned an Oriole game.  The next Sunday home games are tomorrow, July 12, August 2, 16, & 23.  It might be tough to coordinate with everyone’s vacation and work schedule—but we will make something happen. 
·       When school starts….We will be having monthly service luncheons on the 2nd Friday of every month to continue to remain active in our service communities.  Our first meeting is Friday, September 11th.  The Jamaica service team will be the focus of the meeting.  On the menu—Pumpkin Rice and Curried Goat.
I know Ms. Kurtzman is out of town, but I have to share a story she told me.  She and I will be getting together next week for lunch to talk about the trip---but we were on the phone this week and she said that she was at the pool on the day of the crazy storm and decided to take a yoga class because the pool was closing.  The yoga teacher had to leave class and asked if there was anyone who knew Sun Salutations and could lead the class for a few minutes while the instructor stepped out.  Guess who stepped up…MK.  Coincidence….I think not.
I think I’m going to go to Immaculate Conception tomorrow at 8AM—hopefully I’ll see Tim.  If not—I’ll still have been meant to go there.  God will reveal a reason.  Then, I’m going to go to my church in the city tomorrow at 11AM.  Consider yourself always invited to join me.  The music rocks—if you know Luther Vandross, Donny Hathaway, or Stevie Wonder—you’ll love the bandleader, Brian.  Mr. O’Kane loves him, too.
Stay in touch, mon!KC
P.S. Please forward this to Pat.  I don't have his normal email address and I don't know if school student emails work in the summer.

MK and I met up last week for yoga and breakfast in the city. Hopefully you guys are still staying connected with one another.  I ran into Doc Don the other day--she said she ran into Ben's mom and said how Ben's mom went on and on about how great Ben said the Jamaica trip was. This made me happy.I see Mr. Brown a lot and I've been listening to the Grateful Dead lately.  I used to listen to the dead when I was in high school and college, but it has been a band I had forgotten about.  It's been great listening again and hearing things differently—I never noticed all of the vocal harmonies before. I never noticed all of the banjo.  I never noticed all of the lyrics.  Hearing this song new again gives me chills.https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=671AgW9xSiAWhere have you seen your Jamaica experience ripple into your encounters with others?I'm about halfway through A Separate Peace.  This book is also more beautiful every time I read it.  Those of you reading it--Pat, Dennis, MK, who else--who does Finny remind you of? BTW, how is everyone's summer reading? I'm a nerd in the summer--and most of the time--so if you have any recommendations--send them my way.  I'm looking forward to Go Set A Watchman by Harper Lee.  I pre-ordered it on amazon and it comes in July 14.  It's the story of To Kill A Mockingbird told from Scout's perspective twenty years later--for those of you who live under a rock.  It's always great to get a new perspective on a familiar story.  For any of you ambitious readers taking my class next year, I'll give you a heads up.  The first major work we'll be reading is In Cold Blood by Truman Capote.  It's a nonfiction, true crime narrative recounting the murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb Kansas in 1959.  There was a movie starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote capturing the events surrounding his reporting and writing of what he proclaimed to be the first nonfiction novel.  Capote was a fascinating man and writer.  I hope you take the time to get into it--either now, or when we start the book in class.  (Which will be the first thing we do after we write our college essays.)I hope everyone is safe in their travels--be it near or far--in planes, trains, or even your new automobiles.  I'm taking a road trip to Tennessee later in the summer.  The drive through eastern Tennessee is gorgeous and I plan on going back to Graceland.  Listen to Paul Simon sing about it---it's another incredible place.https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rDXzLeFUkpcI'm going to try to get to the Reverend Al Green's church in Memphis while I'm there, too.  Mr. Baier told me about it.  For those of you who don't know Al Green--shame on you.  You’re missing out on some good stuff.https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=COiIC3A0ROMHere are some final thoughts...•        The end of summer service cookout is Sunday, August 30 at Loyola.  This will be a potluck.  We’ll send out a flyer soon for you to pass on to your family.•        You may have read it before or heard stories—but read the book of Mark. Something new might hit you.•        Hopefully you’ve had a chance to check out 88.9FM on Saturday mornings\/afternoons.  Music was such a part of our experience in Jamaica—and it’s a language that so many of us connect to.  You can travel back to Jamaica—just by listening to music.•        The Baltimore summer service trip will be out in Federal Hill on July 23, 28, and 29.  Let me or Ms. Szzz know if you’d like to tag along.  It would show amazing leadership on your part if you even had the slightest desire to continue serving back home.•        When is this Jamaica reunion?  I know you all are on group text message with MK—so get coordinating.  It will probably tough to get EVERYONE together—but that’s no reason not to try.•        Remember to wish Ryan a happy birthday on Friday, July 10.Well---I guess that's all in this letter from Sister Christ to the Loyolans.It’s been sunny, cloudy, rainy, sunny, torrentially down pouring, and now sunny again in the time it’s taken me to write this. Whatever the weather is wherever you are—physically, emotionally, or spiritually… Lively up yourselves, dons,KC

7\/17\/15YOU NEBBA SEE SUMOKE WIDOUT FIYAH
Wha gwaan, dons!I don’t have a lot of time to write today—still, I’m sure I’ll manage to write too much for some of you to read.  Are you even reading these, btw? I know MK is—so MK—this one is especially for you.Do not be discouraged.  Remember how simple, special, and precious our time was in Jamaica. It felt that way because we were on a mission.  We were detached from technology and we were living in community with one another.  We are no longer living in that community—we are probably attached to our technology again—and our lives right now might feel very far from mission like.  Do not be discouraged.  We carry Jamaica in our hearts and it’s not something that will ever leave us.  We only need to take the time to search for it—and look for the true, noble, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, and praiseworthy parts that are within each of us. Let us be reminders to one another.  I want to share with you something I wrote for Ryan.  He asked me to write him a letter of recommendation.  Here is an excerpt from the letter I wrote…“I cannot think of anything more challenging to test a person’s character as when they are asked to care for the elderly.   Especially for a teenager. At the Home for the Destitute and Dying, run by Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity, the Sisters go to the local hospitals and take in those who have been abandoned by their families and care for them until they pass on to the next life.  Here, Ryan and his classmates spent a day of service, humbling themselves in the most menial and intimate of tasks.  On one particular day of our mission, Ryan witnessed a classmate shave an elderly man.  It took this particular young man hours. He was drenched in sweat, supported himself against a wall as he leaned in and got as close as a man could get to another person, and treated him with kindness, respect, and delicacy.  I witnessed Ryan’s reaction to this and it moved me deeply.  “I’m so proud of Dennis.  I thought my job was difficult. (Ryan’s job was clipping toenails.) Dennis is a rockstar.”  His sense of empathy and respect beamed and I have never been more impressed with a young person as I was with Ryan at that moment.  He was humbled.  Later that evening, Ryan praised Dennis for his stamina and perseverance—but it was truly Ryan who had been changed by witnessing this.  Ryan thoughtfully processed this experience in a way that poured outwards.  If you were to ask Ryan about what he remembers most—he would describe when he witnessed someone else lay down himself for another person.  These kind of experiences have profound effect on us.  Ryan is a young man who has been molded by service.”Remember each of us had our own personal moments of awakening. They never leave you.  They also make the world seem different.  When things start going wrong—and we head down challenging paths—and we become ashamed, afraid, and uncertain about ourselves—take heart. Do not be discouraged.  Think of the man and the little boy who took your hand.  Think of the little children’s voices singing in church. Think of each other. I ended Ryan’s letter with this…“The bond one experiences on a mission trip is difficult to put into words. We put aside our pride and put others first—we become the best versions of ourselves.  Having had the honor and privilege to witness the best self of Ryan Patrick Gochar has taught me many things—but one of the most important is that actions speak louder than words.”You can fill in your name in Ryan’s place.  I had the honor to witness the best self of MK, PM, MO, TC, WO, DT, BA,  and RG.  Remember your best selves, dons.  Strive to be him\/her. It’s who you really are.The real world sucks sometimes.  If only we could have stayed in Jamaica.  But the mission for all of us now is to show the world how Jamaica changed us—not by our words—but by our actions.  By our reactions to things when we are slapped in the face with life.  When things don’t go our way and when our heart hurts. When we feel abandoned and alone and like no one understands us.  You are not alone.  You have your Jamaica family to reach out to. You have your Jamaica family to build you back up. You have your Jamaica family to lean on.  Do not be discouraged. My phone was on some weird setting and only recently did I start receiving the group texts—so some of you know I was recently in New York City.  I have to tell you—we went to hear the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir and then went out to this fancy French restaurant in Brooklyn on which happened to be Bastille Day.  I ordered the duck breast. It was amazing.  There was a Zydeco band playing in the front of the house and we had a French waitress.  I had a fancy French cocktail and ordered the crème brulee for desert.  The band took a break and then the radio came on.  You will never guess what was playing—or maybe you will.  The restaurant was playing BOB MARLEY Pandora.  Here...in the middle of Brooklyn, in the middle of a French restaurant on Bastille Day—was I reminded of Jamaica.  (Honestly—everything reminds me of Jamaica.  I’m dog sitting for a friend this weekend and her dog’s name is Toshie—named for Peter Tosh—one of the original Wailers. )Those are the things I’m talking about. Be observant. Be watchful. Open your eyes and ears. Open your hearts. You’ll find Jamaica.  Or even better—it will find you.I didn’t watch this entire video—but this is the song the girls sang in church--“Break  Every Chain”--sung by a very popular gospel singer.  The video is from an actual church service and I didn’t see one white person in the choir or the audience—it looks a lot different from our masses at Loyola—but nonetheless The first 3-4 minutes of the video are great.  You have to be in the right mindset to hear it. If you are feeling sad or discouraged—go to a quiet place and listen.https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6vjlpg9i2BgI went to the Caribbean Festival last Sunday in Lake Clifton Park in the city.  I was the only white person.  I’m going to see The Wailers on Tuesday at Rams Head Live.  Sadly--it's a 21 and over show.If you are in need of a pumped up jam--blare this one.  With the windows down.  In your mustang convertible or Ford Explorer or Hyundai or your parent’s minivan.  Matisyahu is an orthodox Jewish, reggae rapper.  He needs to be on your musical radar.  This song especially. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WRmBChQjZPsOne day we will all get together.  But until then—even if two or three of you do—it’s still a Jamaica reunion. Some Upcoming Dates:Thursday, July 23            Loyola Baltimore Service Trip to SHARPkids camp. (In Federal Hill. ) Not too late to sign up. Let me or Ms. Szzz know ASAP.  Even if it’s for one hour.  Get yourself down to the city and serve. Remember—service ends up serving you.  Why wouldn’t you?Tuesday, July 28              Loyola Baltimore Service Trip to SHARPkids campWednesday, July 29       Loyola Baltimore Service Trip to SHARPkids campAugust 2                           Smile Jamaica Reunion-- Any or all of the following (Yoga\/Church\/Food\/Orioles Game)August 30                         Summer Service Celebration

 7\/27\/15A SUNDAY KIND OF LOVE
Wha gwaan, dons?
I’m working at the pool this morning--Having church listening to U2’s Rattle and Hum.  I’ve been thinking all week about what would be the content of this week’s letter. What I usually do is sit down and write from the heart.  I try to think of points to cover—but once I sit down to write—I let it flow. I often interrupt myself and you can probably tell how scattered my thoughts are by my use of em dashes—my favorite form of punctuation.
What I’d really like to encourage you to do is write about your Jamaica experience.  I was grateful to receive Dennis’ encouraging text, as well as MK’s heartfelt reflection about Ms. Harris. Writing can help us process things.  It’s why I’ve been writing you letters.
And while we are on the topic of writing—I’m wondering if any of you have thought about your college essay?
The reason this week’s letter is so late is because I really had no idea what to write.  I suggested to MK that she write a letter this week and she said she didn’t think it would be the same coming from her.  I said that is exactly the point!  All I do in these letters is share a bit of my experiences and try to be encouraging.  I’d love to hear of your experiences and be encouraged by you.  It’s like I said in Jamaica—teaching and leading is not a one way street.  It’s a relationship. There is so much all of you taught me on the trip and I’m looking forward to seeing everyone again and continue to learn from you.  God knows I don’t have all the answers.  You all have helped me to see the world in a different—more beautiful way—and I want our relationship to continue.  I want to make Jamaica stay.
MK and I met last Sunday for yoga in the city, then we went to church. It was awesome to be with her.   I learn a lot by being with her and she really is an inspiration to me. 
We heard this song at church. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=he32vwlKQPYWe are here in this world temporarily—but we belong somewhere else.  Mrs. Harris is now where she belongs. 
I think this song also illustrates the idea of being meant for more.  If watching this does not give you chills—nothing will.https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6JLW8XNYW6c
I’m not sure I’ll find exactly what I’m looking for—but I’m flying out to Memphis this evening.  I came across this statement in planning my trip—“If music was a religion, then Memphis would be Jerusalem and Sun Studio its most holy shrine.”
I’m going to the National Civil Rights museum—located. Friday news round-up.... Today's news round-up is illustrated by a picture of one of the cleaner Volkswagens on the road, charging away happily in central Brighton... Dieselgate is well-reported elsewhere, and this is a story that will continue to unfold, so no great detail here - but I will smugly point out that I did write about how ""cycle-beating... can involve activating selective catalytic reduction to reduce NOx"" as part of a lengthy cover story feature (click here to read!) for a well-respected engineering magazine earlier this year. This looked more generally at the emissions\/fuel consumption testing regime and the gaping disparities between 'official' data and real-life driving, but the SCR dodge was discussed, albeit without reference to a specific manufacturer (fear of legal action, given that manufacturers and trade associations were adamant that all this was within the regulatory framework.) So yeah, we knew. Problem was getting people to listen.

Kudos has to go to the ICCT, of course, for doing the testing work, and to European lobbying organisation Transport & Environment for continuing to raise awareness and kick up a stink, and for providing mere writers\/observers like me with data, quotes and general backing-up of arguments. Hoping now, of course, that all this will put an end to the diesel disinformation\/greenwashing campaigns, bring on far more stringently-monitored regulation, and accelerate the demise of diesel (at least in passenger cars and light-duty vehicles, in the short-term) and ultimately fossil-fuel dependency full stop. As the far-cleverer-than-me people at the Economist wrote this week, ""if VW’s behaviour hastens diesel’s death, it may lead at last, after so many false starts, to the beginning of the electric-car age.""

And in other news\/musings this week...

	Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) has developed a new real-time data exchange system for electromobility, better-linking service providers, vehicles, fleet operators, charging equipment and users. The ELISE project resulted in a telematics-based control system which can support energy storage and even selling energy from a car back to the grid. More here.


	Bosch (enabled by the purchase of Californian start-up Seeo Inc.) is working on solid-state battery tech said to potentially double the range of EVs and PHEVs within five years - without an increase in size. These batteries have no ionic liquid, and can have pure lithium anodes; more here. 


	Some updates on the 'Apple car': 2019, according to the WSJ, which adds that the 600-person team currently working on the project is set to triple. The car will certainly be electric, but while Apple is researching autonomous driving very seriously, it may not be fully-autonomous at first.


	Have to admit that the whole smartwatch thing utterly baffles me, but should such things appeal, Ford is now making its MyFord Mobile apps wrist-compatible (Apple, Android Wear; US.) For EV and PHEV users, the watch app enables remote monitoring of charge levels, notification of reaching full charge levels, pre-heating\/cooling of cabin, locking\/unlocking doors, and mileage\/last trip summary data showing efficiency, plus vehicle location directions (i.e. to walk back to the car.) Google Maps is incorporated, with info on charging stations.


	Catching up on the Uptake of ultra low emissions vehicles in the UK report for the Department for Transport (August 2015): it's an overview of socio-demographic characteristics of EV drivers (UK) and likely next-generation uptake, general usage, charging behaviour, attitudes and motivations. Nothing new or surprising here, but a very useful summary of research so far in this area...


	Looking again at a London\/Berlin comparo: 35% of Londoners rely on a car for their daily travel, over half prefer to travel by car than other means, and 75% of households have a car, according to a study outlined by Citylab. (Full report from LSE Cities\/Innoz here.) Patterns were similar in both cities apart from much more cycling in Berlin, but the interesting thing here is the segmentation of the participants - 'technology-focused individualists', 'pragmatic transit sceptics', 'green-oriented', 'innovative access-oriented' and 'traditional car-oriented' - and how policy and incentive-offering need to tackle these groups differently. (This kind of approach has been called for in the above-mentioned report for the DfT, with regard to EV drivers.)


	The Hydrogen Mobility Europe project (H2ME) launched yesterday brings together initiatives in 10 countries to support hydrogen-fuelled mobility and establishment of refuelling infrastructure. This follows the opening of the wind turbine-powered hydrogen station (public access) just off the M1 Junction 33 in South Yorkshire (225kW wind turbine driving the electrolyser, 220kg of hydrogen storage plus a 30kW fuel cell for back-up power to nearby buildings) and an agreement to develop a solar-powered hydrogen station on the A13 in Essex.. Grazing land wasted in oil company offsets: ranchers. Alberta ranchers in the Fawcett and Flatbush area are angry that oil money is being used to buy pastureland that is sitting idle while they scramble to find other land to graze their animals.  
 
Shell and Suncor have bought 15 quarters of land in the area through the Alberta Conservation Association as part of a program designed to offset damage the companies have done to wildlife and biodiversity in other parts of the province.  
 
“The pasture is sitting idle and slowly it will grow back to trees,” said Fred vandeLigt, who tried to buy a quarter section he had originally been renting from a neighbour.   
 
“They’re paying top dollar. It’s like an oil company going into a little town and buying all the houses.”  
 
VandeLigt originally bid $180,000 for the quarter near Flatbush, the top value he believed it was worth. The land was assessed and sold to the Alberta Conservation Association for $199,000.  
 
In a year in which grazing is scarce because of drought, vandeLigt believes the land should be grazed.   
 
He started feeding yearlings July 20.  
 
Ted Ford of Jarvie doesn’t object to the price paid for the land, but doesn’t think good grazing land should be left to sit idle.  
 
“The issue to me is, they are taking land out of production that is very good land,” said Ford, who ranches in the area.   
 
“They say they don’t pay over the appraised value. They may only pay the appraised value, but it is more than most people in the area would pay for land.… It is not prime land, but it is good land. If nothing happens it will slowly revert to trees.”  
 
Letting it revert to trees and sloughs is exactly what is going to happen to the 15 quarters of land in the area, said Todd Zimmerling, president of the Alberta Conservation Association.  
 
Over the past decade, the association has bought land in the area on behalf of Suncor and Shell as part of the company’s terrestrial conservation offsets.  
 
Unlike carbon offsets for emissions made elsewhere, terrestrial conservation offsets are designed to offset the impacts to wildlife and plants that have occurred somewhere else.  
 
Most of the property that the conservation association bought in the Fawcett and Flatbush area was bought with money from Shell.  
 
“As part of one of their developments in the Fort McMurray area, they agreed they would offset the terrestrial impacts by purchasing land they can restore across the boreal forest,” said Zimmerling.  
 
Working with other conservation groups, the association will replant the land to trees, native grasses and shrubs or install ditch plugs to restore wetlands.  
 
“Part of the management plan was to restore wetland and forested land on some of those properties,” Zimmerling said.  
 
“That is the reason it has changed from having grazing regime to no grazing regime. The plan is to restore it to native habitat instead.”  
 
Shell is in the ninth year of a 10-year agreement to donate $200,000 a year to the association to buy land for offsets specifically in the Athabasca River drainage area. Next year is expected to be the last year that land will be bought with the help of Shell in the Flatbush and Fawcett area.  
 
Suncor has also donated money to the association for the last decade to buy terrestrial conservation credits. Last year it donated $600,000 for land purchases, especially treed and forested properties.   
 
“In the case of Suncor, the properties we look for are forested properties,” ” said Zimmerling.  
 
“The more trees on the property the better to try to maintain the forest cover. In some cases, if it is not completely forested, we will reforest them,” said Zimmerling.

We're in a parking crisis. Nick Austin of Divvy: has a solution to the parking problem. Photo: James Alcock By 2031, an estimated 30.5 million people will be living in Australia and our capital cities will be contributing $1.6 trillion to our economy.

These projected figures by Infrastructure Australia will result in the vast majority of the extra 6 million people living in our cities and still wanting to commute by car.

In fact, the Australian Infrastructure Audit report states that ""car travel times are expected to increase by at least 20 per cent in the most congested corridors. In some cases, travel times could more than double between 2011 and 2031"".

So, if driving is going to be that difficult, can you imagine trying to find a park?

Divvy Parking may be your answer. The platform enables you to find previously hidden parking spaces in the CBD – for a monthly fee.

""Through Divvy's partnerships with major commercial property groups like DEXUS Group, GPT and Knight Frank, drivers can find and access off-street parking that is affordable and convenient for them,"" Nick Austin, CEO and founder of Divvy Parking, says.

""Divvy currently offers monthly bookings but is close to rolling out industry first mobile access technology that will let people book and access secure short term parking with ease through their smartphone.""

Infrastructure Australia has warned that congestion in Sydney could cost Australia $53 billion by 2031 and while the greater population in Australia's cities can't do without their cars, there is no point driving into the CBD unless you have somewhere to park.

""Those rare spaces that can be found are usually limited to one or two hours, and current daily car park rates can set you back as much as a parking fine,"" Austin says. ""Creating an improved parking solution at the destination can actually reduce congestion by up to 30 per cent.

""The spaces we have available on Divvy were previously under-utilised by their owners – be they commercial property owners or building managers.

""We have worked closely with these firms to help them get a booking and marketing platform that makes their lives incredibly easy, reduces their admin costs and improves the yield of otherwise dead assets.""

Another solution might be the option of DriveMyCar, a car rental service, which Chris Noone started five years ago.

""DriveMyCar is not your traditional car rental company,"" Noone says. ""We are an online peer-to-peer marketplace connecting car owners looking to earn some extra money by renting out their car, with drivers who are no longer prepared to pay high car rental costs and want more choice.

""It is completely free for owners to list their car and free for both owners and renters to register with DriveMyCar.""

According to Noone, thousands of cars are under-utilised in Australia with 35% of Sydney households having two cars. He says that people often want to rent cars from one week onwards.

But there is a catch.

""Normal car insurance does not cover cars that are used for rental purposes, that's why it's risky to rent a car through Gumtree and the like,"" Noone says. ""DriveMyCar holds a motor fleet policy that covers cars for damage and theft during rental.""

But he is very confident that the model will work.

""We have over 400 vehicles available, nearly 15,000 registered users, $4.4 million paid out to car owners through nearly 5000 bookings,"" he says. ""DriveMyCar is rapidly becoming the no fuss, go-to platform for everyday Aussies, travellers and businesses to rent cars, without being ripped off.

""The cost of insurance is included in the advertised listing price, not lumped on as a hidden extra and the insurance excess is lower than many traditional car rental firms.

""Cars are up to 62 per cent cheaper than other car rental firms because DriveMyCar doesn't own the fleet of cars available – it's tapping into the thousands of cars around Australia that aren't being used.""

Earlier this year Ford developed a parking app, the parking spotter, to bring to the market.

Developed with Georgia Tech, the app leverages driver-assisted sensors that most Ford vehicles already have, including sonar and radar, by putting them to work for everybody.

The sensors search for open parking spaces while the driver looks around for spots in the city, and shares the information with a cloud database that other drivers can access.

The system makes it easier for a driver to locate an open spot, reserve it and navigate the space. It also reduces fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

By while all these innovations are helpful, they still don't address the key issues of addressing Australia's infrastructure issues and the urgency required in fixing our transport problems.

With demand for public transport in the capital cities (measured by passenger kilometres travelled) set to rise by 55 per cent in Sydney, 121 per cent in Melbourne and an average of 89 per cent across all capital cities, unless peak period passenger loads are managed and capacity is increased, commuters in all capital cities will see more services experiencing ""crush loadings"", where peak demand exceeds capacity.. Continental, Schaeffler to unveil 48 V belt starter generator module. Continental has teamed up with Schaeffler to introduce a compact module comprising of a 48 V belt starter generator (BSG) and an integrated belt drive to integrate a BSG between the internal combustion engine and transmission. 
 
By adding a second clutch in front of the BSG, the company expects that the internal combustion engine will not be used and it can be driven by the belt in recovery phase, which will offer more power to the vehicle to adopt fuel-saving driving strategies. 

Continental Powertrain Division head José Avila said: ""The major benefit of BSG integration between the internal combustion engine and transmission is that recuperation becomes more efficient as a crucial source of energy for the 48 V side. 

""Consequently, we estimate that a mild hybrid with a 48 V Eco Drive using the side-mounted architecture will be capable of saving an additional 5% of CO2."" 

Continental said that it would be launching series production of the 48 V Eco Drive for numerous customers next year, and the initial applications will involve integrating the BSG in the belt drive on the front side of the engine. 

It highlighted that the integration will require minor modification of the vehicle. 

The 48 V belt is expected to enter series production at Continental next year and is likely to be the highlight of P2-BSG. 

The BSG is the new prototype module for side-mounting which is similar to the version for integration in the engine belt drive. 

Schaeffler is also testing the capabilities of 48 volt hybridization system in a Gasoline Technology Car (GTC) which the company co-developed with Ford and Continental. 

Schaeffler and Continental also collaborated to introduce a new chassis technology which is capable of effectively prevent any yawing of the vehicle. 

The design helps to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, which is designed to make vehicle assembly more straightforward, and Continental helped develop the technology by providing sophisticated control solutions for the system..

September 30, 2015 - 11:57 am ET DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is recalling about 37,000 of the current-generation F-150s because the adaptive cruise control can be fooled by other trucks on the road and 342,000 Windstar minivans for possible cracking in the rear axle.They are the largest of six recalls announced today by Ford covering a total of about 382,000 vehicles. The other four affect fewer than 1,500 vehicles each.The F-150 recall involves an update to the adaptive cruise control module software in some trucks from the 2015 model year. Ford said the radar can become confused “when passing a large, highly reflective truck” and suddenly apply the brakes because it thinks both vehicles are in the same lane.The issue may be linked to one accident, but no injuries were reported, Ford said.The Windstar recall covers vans from the 1998 through 2003 model years and relates to a previous recall for rear axle cracking from 2010. Corrosion and stress can lead to cracks that could grow and result in a complete fracture, Ford said. The original repair involved installing a reinforcement bracket to reduce the risks of a broken axle, but Ford now says those brackets may have been installed incorrectly.Dealers are being told to inspect the vehicles and replace the axle for free if the bracket was installed incorrectly. If the bracket was correctly installed, customers will be offered a discounted rear-axle replacement. Ford said it knows of “a small number of accidents that might be connected to this issue but no injuries.”Ford also announced the following recalls, none of which are associated with any accidents or injuries: About 70 Ford Escapes and Mercury Mariners from the 2001 through 2008 model years with remanufactured transmissions for possible loose shift-control lever bolts that could let the vehicles roll away. About 250 Ford Tauruses, Ford Explorers and Lincoln MKS cars for improperly tightened fuel-tank attachment bolts that could lead to a leak and a fire. About 1,500 2016 F-53 and F-59 stripped chassis vehicles for a possible issue with the shift-control bracket that could allow shifting into reverse without applying the brake. About 700 2016 Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ cars for fuel tanks that might have been manufactured improperly and could crack in a crash, leading to a leak and a fire.You can reach Nick Bunkley at nbunkley@crain.com. -- Follow Nick on Tags: RecallsVehicle SafetyFordF-150 advertising  Print Reprints RespondHave an opinion about this story?

President Donald Trump Holds First News Conference. (Transcript by ) 

Jorge Ramos : President Trump, on your deportation plan… 

President Trump : I didn’t call on you. 

Jorge Ramos : I represent Univision. I have a right… 

Trump : Excuse me. Wait until my lawsuit against Univision gets to the Supreme Court. 

Jorge Ramos : By then you’ll have your sister on the Supreme Court. 

Trump : She’s smart, very smart. And she knows I love women and I’m in favor of women’s health. Mexican women. All women. Sit down, or I’ll appoint Ann Coulter U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. 

Ramos : I have a question. What about your plan to deport eleven million or more… 

Trump : Sit down, or the Secret Service will remove you. 

Ramos : I’m a fully credentialed American citizen. 

Trump : You have an accent. And you’ve never been nice to me. Besides, Helen Thomas asks the first question. Where’s Helen? 

Reporter : Mr. President, she died nearly four years ago. 

Trump : While she was dying, I was creating jobs. Politicians talk and talk. All she did was write and write, for sixty years, and she still could not afford to buy a one bedroom unit in my cheapest building. A loser. So why did she stop working? 

Reporter : She said Jews should leave Israel and go back to Germany. 

Trump : My lawyer is Jewish. I like Jews. Many of them, just like the Saudis, buy apartments from me. I can unite Jews and Arabs. I know how to do it! And the biggest Chinese bank is one of my tenants. I love the Chinese. They love me. Mel Gibson has a Trump condo, but many Jews work for me. Ivanka works for me. I love Israel. 

Reporter : Why do you feel that way, Mr. President? 

Trump : Israel knows how to treat its veterans. And they have a wall. The Chinese built the best wall...so far. But no one builds a wall like Trump, you’ll see. It will be YOU-UUGE. And with a big welcome beautiful doorway for people who speak English and who read my book. 

Reporter : Helen Thomas opposed Israel’s wall. 

Trump : You see, anyone who is anti-wall goes down in the polls. Besides, is that the face you would want to open each presidential news conference? 

Reporter : For years, Mr. President, Helen was the UPI reporter who traditionally asked the first question. Regardless of her looks… 

Trump : Excuse me, but what if you had Carly Fiorina on ‘The View” answering a question from fat, ugly Rosie O’Donnell who attacks beauty pageants? Carly is a beautiful woman, inside and out, I’ve said that, but listening to Carly gives me a headache, looking at Rosie verges on a migraine. Look, with my YOU-UUGE inheritance I was able to buy many disgusting-looking New York politicians. I knew Congresswoman Bella Abzug, and fair is fair: Megyn Kelly, you’re no Bella. 

Reporter : Gloria Steinem doesn’t like your tone. 

Trump : Christians are being beheaded. And she talks about my tone. Many journalists are horrible, horrible people. I never heard of Rich Lowry until he talked about my private parts. There will be no more questions unless reporters are nice to me. 

Reporter : But Mr. President, you must hold news conferences for the American people. 

Trump : I’m going to increase ratings like you’ve never seen. We’re going to run commercials, with the money going to the vets. I’ll pick a Twitter woman to ask the opening question each news conference, because… 

Reporter : Twitter doesn’t have reporters… 

Trump : A Twitter woman will cover me. I’ll be able to say, ‘She has a good figure. If I were not president, I would be dating her.’ 

Reporter : Isn’t that sexist? 

Trump : People are tired of political correctness. 

Reporter : What about your marriage? 
 
Trump : Before me, no one was elected president with A.D.D. That’s why I can cover so many subjects in thirty seconds. Ronald Reagan was great, I admired him, and he admired me. We were both divorced. And he was the first divorced man to be president. I’m the first twice-divorced man to be elected president. Now, what do I do? When I get that 2AM call, do I want to be high energy or always with the same person? I could be the first president divorced while in office. Divorced people are not losers. I love divorced people. And they love me, if you know what I mean. Besides, many African-Americans are divorced. African-Americans are in my buildings, even as tenants, and they have no problems with the police. 

Reporter : I’m from El-Jazeera and Arab lives matter. 

Trump : Be fair to me or I’ll buy your network and say, ‘You’re fired.’ 

Reporter : Would you be open to your successor being a Muslim? 

Trump : The U.S. Constitution says no religious test, unless of course the Muslim was an anchor baby. Muslims love me. Muslim veterans in America know I’m on their side, if, of course, they served in our military. McCain was not good for veterans. Rick Perry was a veteran, and the V.A. prescribed glasses to make him look smarter. That was not priority. But we can’t have a First Lady wearing a hejib. 

Reporter : You mean a hijab. 

Trump : Burka, that word I know. That was a gotcha question. When the time comes, I’ll know more Arab words than you ever will. 

Reporter : When will that time come? 

Trump : Timing is everything in making a deal. I don’t learn anything until there is ‘a need to know.’ 

Reporter : After your two terms in office, will you support a Muslim, or not? 

Trump : I’ll pick the right Muslim who respects my legacy -- the best Persian rug merchant I can find who prays five times a day on a prayer rug that shows no signs of wear. Those people are good negotiators. They don’t need to read The Art of the Deal, but it will soon be in Arabic, because Palestinians need it. They could have moved to Syria. 

Reporter : What about the Koran? 

Trump : I’m a Presbyterian. 

Reporter : Many of the Palestinians are secular. 

Trump : Even the Pope has sciatica. We’ll throw chiropractors into the deal. 

Reporter : Will you admit more Arab male refugees now? They want to leave France because they say they are unfairly blamed for raping women who dress provocatively. 

Trump : I’m going to send the beheaders back and keep the good ones. And there are many good ones. Many, many good ones. 

Reporter : How will you know the beheaders? 

Trump : Why would I put my strategy out there? I can say this: San Francisco will not be a sanctuary city for beheaders. Of course I can’t tell you how I know this, but beheaders are getting Obamacare for carpel tunnel syndrome, and we have a tremendous number of unreported beheadings. They behead people who try to get the facts out about the beheadings. Look, once we identify a beheader, I can keep out all eight wives, and an average of thirty-eight children. Think of all those income tax exemptions we don’t have to provide. 

Reporter : Let me ask you about tax policy. You pledged to tax hedge fund managers at regular rates, not the lower capital gains rate. 

Trump : That applied only to stocks. They can still invest in real estate at preferred rates and go bankrupt four times, as I did, using the same law available to all Americans who can take advantage of it. 

Reporter : Is this part of your economic plan? 

Trump : Absolutely, provide opportunity, not minimum wage jobs. Just like the way I used eminent domain. If you like a piece of property, give money to a politician, get the government to condemn it, and buy it on the cheap. 

Reporter : May I change the subject? Why are you still funding Planned Parenthood? 

Trump : I said during the campaign I would fund it, and I would not. We’ve had stupid people running our country, stupid people at Planned Parenthood, and stupid reporters like you. 

Reporter : You once said you learned about foreign policy from television. So let me ask… 

Trump : Excuse me. Anyone can be knowledgeable, fluent and articulate, like Marco Rubio who owed money to credit card companies. I am rich. Very, very rich. I was never briefed for any presidential debate. I will not change now. Wm. F. Buckley Jr. wanted to be governed by names at random from the telephone book and thus endorsed me before he died. I want to be as uninformed as the American people. They want a strong leader who does not need a teleprompter. The election’s mandate is clear – a president who talks off the cuff, stream of consciousness, imprecisely and not preoccupied with consequences. People know I’m smart, very smart. We know that presidents who read daily CIA briefings do bad deals. 

Reporter : You said you would resolve our problems with Russia by meeting with Putin. 

Trump : I will say this, Putin is high-energy, but people like him ride horses in Central Park, with or without a shirt. I won’t give this has-been the time of day unless he releases our hostages. 

Reporter : Russia doesn’t have any hostages. 

Trump : They are holding Americans who know where Obama was born. I won’t do any deal with Russia until we find out if Obama was born in China or another country ripping us off. And remember, John Kerry was 73 and riding a bicycle. That’s why the Iran deal was the worst. 

Reporter : What now? 

Trump : We have a win-win situation, that’s the way my deals work. I sent Henry Kissinger to see the Iranians. He didn’t say anything, just grunted and mumbled and recited the Paris Vietnam accords from memory. But his wife Nancy used to work for Nelson Rockefeller, and the Rockefellers put the Shah in power. She is taller than Henry and also wears high heels. She even wore a burka. If I were a woman in my eighties, I also would wear a burka. That’s politically incorrect, I know. I love women in their eighties. Anyway, she intimidated them to accept an unlimited number of Mexican rapists who are here illegally. 

Reporter : How many rapists? 

Trump : Excuse me. Not just rapists but also other bad people, really bad people who do bad things. Do you understand these are not nice people? The agreement provides they convert from Catholicism to Islam. Santorum is a Catholic. Huckabee is not a Presbyterian. They and the evangelicals will not oppose me on this, because I went to Sunday school. Chris Christie complains, because he was a choir boy. But he’s fat and was not molested. Scott Walker doesn’t care, because union membership will decline; he’s always unintimidated. Ben Carson is aboard, as long as no Seventh Day Adventists with gifted hands are involved in the deal. 

Reporter : What do we get out of this? 

Trump : Excuse me. We’re going to make America great again. I’m going to find all the relatives of these rapists and bad people and also send them over to Iran for family reunification. I am for families. I’m a nice person. Really nice. No one is for families more than this president. That’s why I have three. Family values. 

Reporter : Throughout the election you said the Bible was the most important book to you, and you brought it with you when you spoke before evangelical groups. Now that you’re president, will you tell us any scripture that is meaningful for you? 

Trump : I can never disclose this information because it might be used by ISIS. I explained this at last week’s Congressional Prayer Breakfast. Obviously you are an incompetent reporter. 

Reporter : Why in your inaugural address did you say that Congress is the dumbest in history? 

Trump : I did not say ‘in history’; I said dumb, low-energy, lightweights who are corrupt lackeys of Wall Street special interests. You have to insult them to get anything done. If they don’t pass what I want, then no White House tours for their constituents, no FBI tours, so souvenir pens. They hit me, I hit them back, twice as hard. I will not take criticism unless I deserve it. And I never do. 

Reporter : What happened to the usual honeymoon with Congress for a new president? 

Trump : Honeymoons are for losers who owe money on student loans. I was first in my class at Wharton. 

Reporter : How can you have a truce with Congress? 

Trump : Let’s face it -- a lot of them are stupid people who don’t want to be called stupid. 

Reporter : But they have to represent their district or state…. 

Trump : I was so nice to Marco Rubio, even with his low net worth, and he attacked me anyway. He was a clown, disloyal even to Jeb Bush who was his mentor. They pretended not to hate each other. You know it when I hate someone. I am straightforward. Do you want to feel my hair? I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. 

Reporter : Are you getting Ford to build a plant here instead of Mexico? 

Trump : I’m talking to them about a new Edsel hybrid plant in Wisconsin, which is depressed because Scott Walker was a terrible governor and didn’t graduate from college. I can tell you this, off the record. I cut a deal last night on the phone with VW to put its giant plant, not in Mexico, but in Detroit. They will use untrained, unskilled labor at premium hourly rates. In return, I promised that the original designers of the Obamacare website will create new software to measure their diesel emissions, and VW will self-inspect at the Detroit site. 

Reporter : What’s your forecast for economic growth and the unemployment rate? 

Trump : Excuse me. I’m not going to tell you my strategy and let hedge funds get advance word and make money. 

Reporter : Now, about the future. You did not have a vice presidential running mate… 

Trump : Because, obviously, I’m irreplaceable. The Democrats ran a candidate for vice president because they didn’t have confidence in their nominee. 

Reporter : But what if something happens to you now? 

Trump : Ask Melania. I am in better shape than anyone in Seal Team Six. And we’re not treating Navy Seal veterans properly. They sit for days in the same chair in the waiting room for an appointment with a doctor who doesn’t speak English. They want the American dream – to live in a Trump Tower and use the high-tech gym. 

Reporter : And what do you want for your legacy? 

Trump : I am rich, very rich. And smart, very smart. And a really nice person. People don’t realize that. But I want to be remembered for making America great again. I have written a will that clearly says to whom I am leaving the presidency. 

Reporter : Thank you, Mr. President.. Auto Industry Booming on U.S., Europe Sales. The sustained improvement in labor market and low oil and gas prices has been driving up auto sales, thus becoming a blessing for automakers. Apart from giving a boost to already rising U.S. auto sales, it has helped in the recovery of the European auto market. A series of attractive vehicle launches have added to the pace, notwithstanding the issues surrounding the Volkswagen ( VLKAY ) debacle. However, falling sales in China in recent months is a major concern for automakers. The large volumes of safety recalls are amplifying their problems.

Still, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry for both the short and long term. Below, we discuss some of these key factors that should continue to drive the sector's performance momentum in the near to medium term.OPPORTUNITIES Low Oil & Gas Prices Drive Vehicle Sales

Global oil and gas prices continue to remain low, despite recovering slightly from the six-and-a-half-year low reached recently. The trend is expected to continue, going by Goldman Sachs' recent cut in 2015 domestic crude estimate to $48.10 a barrel from $52.00 and 2016 forecast to $45.00 from $57.00. Moreover, the investment bank projected that crude could fall to as low as $20 per barrel, in the worst case scenario, due to global oversupply.

The low oil and gas prices are benefiting automakers significantly. As fuel becomes more affordable, sales of gasoline-powered vehicles - especially the larger ones that carry a wider profit margin - get a boost. Although sales of hybrids and electronic vehicles are suffering from this trend, the sales volume of such vehicles is significantly lower than gasoline-powered vehicles. Hence, the positive impact of low oil and gas prices outweighs the negatives for the auto sector.

Focus on Vehicle Safety Beneficial for Parts Makers

Increasing focus on the safety of vehicles is benefiting parts manufacturers, specifically those dealing with automotive safety products. For example, 10 major automakers recently agreed to offer automatic emergency braking (""AEB"") systems as a standard feature in all their vehicles in the U.S. Apart from ensuring better road safety, this move will also benefit auto parts manufacturers that produce AEB systems.

Rising U.S. Auto Sales

U.S. light-vehicle sales increased 3.8% year over year to 11.6 million units in the first eight months of 2015. Sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate (""SAAR"") basis surged to 17.81 million units in Aug 2015 from 17.3 million units in Aug 2014. The sales volume was driven by low gas price, an improving employment rate, and the easy availability of credit with lower interest rates and longer repayment periods. U.S. light-vehicle sales increased for the fifth consecutive year in 2014, improving on the six-year high achieved in 2013. In fact, for the first time since the recession in 2008, U.S. auto sales had surpassed 16 million units in 2014. Moreover, the popularity of the more-profitable vehicle segments such as pickup trucks, utility vehicles and luxury cars surged last year, thus benefiting automakers.

The trend is expected to continue courtesy of low fuel prices and interest rates, enhanced job security, rising wages and household wealth, improving consumer confidence, residual pent-up demand, attractive deals and vehicle launches. Analysts expect U.S. light-vehicle sales to reach 7 million units this year.

Moreover, the high average age of light vehicles on U.S. roads is resulting in high replacement demand for cars as well as car parts. The average age is expected to rise to 11.5 years by 2017 and 11.7 years by 2019 from 11.4 years at the end of 2013, according to forecasts by IHS Automotive. This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers.

Sustained Recovery in Europe

The recovery in the European automobile market is continuing this year with an 8.6% year-over-year passenger cars' sales increase recorded in the European Union in the first eight months, according to the European Automobile Manufacturer's Association. The increase in sales is being attributed to improvement in all major markets, including Spain, Germany, UK, France and Italy. Sales of passenger cars in the European Union turned around with a 5.7% year-over-year increase in 2014 that followed six years of decline.

Attractive Vehicle Launches

Rising sales and intense competition are driving automakers to come up with new and attractive, technologically advanced vehicles to gain market share. Most automakers are also revamping their popular vehicles by adding new technologies and enhancing their visual appeal to refresh their sales.

These companies are also offering attractive optional features in vehicles to earn higher profits. These features provide scope for surplus revenue generation from small cars, which have lower profit margins than large trucks.

Government Role in Emission Reduction

Though the much talked-about auto industry bailout is behind us, the U.S. government's role, albeit on a smaller scale, is still felt in the space. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) lent over $8.5 billion to a few automakers under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Incentive Program to encourage greener or more fuel-efficient cars. The aim of the program is to reduce dependence on oil, curb greenhouse gas emissions and create new jobs.

Ford utilized the $5.9 billion DOE loan to retool two plants to produce small cars and develop fuel-efficient vehicles like Ford Focus EV and C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid. The automaker is repaying the loan in equal quarterly installments of $148 million and the full amount is expected to be written off by Jun 15, 2022.

In May 2013, Tesla Motors, Inc. ( TSLA ) became the first DOE loan recipient ($465 million) to repay the full amount. Although the loan was repayable in quarterly installments till Dec 2017, the electric vehicle maker cleared its debt with an advance repayment of the entire outstanding balance.

Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( NSANY ) was another carmaker to benefit from the program. The company obtained a $1.4 billion ATVM loan to retool a manufacturing facility, develop a cost-competitive electric vehicle and construct one of the largest advanced battery manufacturing plants in the U.S.

Apart from this, in late 2011, 13 major automakers - Ford Motor Co. ( F ), General Motors Company ( GM ) and Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) to name a few - signed letters of commitment with the U.S. government to upgrade fuel economy in cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025. This has significantly improved fuel efficiency and emission levels in the recently developed vehicles.

Ford’s Fiesta ST has reigned supreme over the hot hatch market for far too long – according to the latest Corsa VRX, at least. The high-performance Vauxhall has launched an all-out bid to overthrow the king. Can it succeed? 
 
Such is the sensational Ford Fiesta ST’s hold on the hot hatch market, that accomplished contenders from top rival brands have consistently tried and failed to claim its crown. Now it’s the turn of Vauxhall’s new Corsa VXR. To rate its chances, we compare them in a whirlwind head-to-head. 
 
First things first: cold, hard figures. The Corsa 1.6i 205 Turbo VXR is £400 cheaper than the Fiesta 1.6T 180 Ecoboost ST-2, at £17,995. Sounds good? Yes – but don’t expect any dealer discounts just yet. The Vauxhall is far too new. Haggle over the Ford, on the other hand, and you’ll get a grand or more off. The market leader has got better economy and lower emissions as well, which will reflect in cheaper running costs. 
 
 
 
What about performance? Hot hatches aren’t just about straight-line pace – and if they were, surprisingly the Fiesta ST wouldn’t be top of the list. No, they’ve got to sound amazing, shift gears with slick ferocity and steer sublimely. Here, the Ford ticks all the boxes. 
 
Meanwhile, the gutsy VXR packs a punch with its superior 202bhp, racy looks and comparable spec. Is it equally engaging behind the wheel, though? Well... no, not really. Its thrills per mile aren’t as abundant as its extra muscle would indicate on paper, and neither does it sound as beguiling as the 180bhp Ford under full revs. 
 
Compared to the ST’s precise, engaging controls, the Vauxhall’s transmission is less positive and its clutch not as eager. Meanwhile, cornering fun is somewhat inhibited by what feels like excess travel in the brake pedal, as well as overly light steering that simply doesn’t weight up or transmit as accurately as the Ford’s pin-sharp set-up. 
 
Handling is a Fiesta forte. Its flat, composed stance through the twisties, whatever the surface, is in contrast to the Corsa’s less well controlled body and a rear end that shuffles around at the hint of a mid-bend bump. Both cars have a firm ride, but when it comes to corners the Fiesta reaffirms its claim to the crown. 
 
 
 
The Ford doesn’t have everything its own way, however. Its cabin has neither the quality nor the classy user-friendliness of the Vauxhall. It does claw back kudos when it comes to driving position, though; we defy you not to get comfortable whatever your size, whereas lanky pilots may well suffer in the VXR. Where both cabins score a draw is that neither imparts an especially racy vibe. 
 
So everything comes down to fun behind the wheel – and the involving Fiesta has done more than enough to retain its place on the hot hatch throne. Loyal subjects rejoice; hail Ford’s all-conquering king.

 VW  SUPER  SCANDAL  NEW  MINUTE  FORD  EMISSIONS  DUTY  AUTOBLOG. More Lamborghini Huracán LP610-4 Spyder details revealed. More Lamborghini Huracán LP610-4 Spyder details revealed 16:00, 18 September 2015 By Graham Scott, Drop-top Lamborghini will be available from spring 2016. After its global unveiling at the Frankfurt motor show, the Huracán LP610-4 Spyder has also revealed more details about its specification. It’s obviously based on the Huracán but there are some noticeable changes apart from the soft-top roof. That fabric roof takes about 17sec to put up or down, and can be activated at speeds below 30mph. Naturally it has required some changes to the structure to ensure there’s no loss of rigidity. There are buttresses behind the seats and there’s a screen in the rear to cut down on buffeting with the roof up. The lines are deliberately altered for the soft-top but remain true to the original. Changes have added kilos so dry weight is now 1542kg, which has added 0.2sec to the 0-62mph time compared to the coupe, so it is now 3.4sec, with a top end of over 202mph. Power source is the same, the 5.2-litre V10, with 602bhp and 413lb ft of torque. Power now goes to a revised four-wheel drive system with a reworked clutch. The engine now features cylinder on-demand technology in the Spyder and a stop-start system. One suspects this is less to do with owners worrying too much about fuel consumption, but it does bring down the CO2 emissions by 14% compared with the Gallardo Spyder. The Huracán has been a success for Lamborghini, with almost 50% of owners being new to the marque. It has sold well and they’re hoping the addition of a soft-top version will boost sales further. Sales in 2015 are already predicted to exceed all previous years, and the arrival of the Huracán LP610-4 Spyder in spring 2016, at a price of £205,000 in the UK, should keep that momentum going nicely. getreading Related : Get daily news by email Invalid e-mail Subscribe Thanks for subscribing!

Chinese President Xi Jinping defended his government's economic stewardship and said that China's slowing growth and market fluctuations won't deter needed reforms. 

In his first interview with foreign media since the Chinese stocks skidded this summer, Mr Xi told The Wall Street Journal that this summer's government intervention to arrest the plunge was necessary to ""defuse systemic risks"".

The rescue was akin to acts taken by governments in ""some mature foreign markets,"" the president said in written responses to questions submitted by the Journal ahead of his first official state visit to the US. 

On the slowdown that has appeared sharper than both global markets and Beijing expected, Mr Xi urged foreign investors to take the long view and compared the world's second-largest economy to a vessel in rough seas. 

""Any ship, however large, may occasionally get unstable sailing on the high sea,"" he said. 

Mr Xi, who starts his visit in Seattle on Tuesday, played down differences that have unsteadied relations with the US, including cybersecurity and China's island-building in the South China Sea, saying China isn't militarily adventurous and wants to work with Washington to address world challenges.

Added to the agenda in recent weeks for Mr Xi's summit with President Barack Obama are concerns about China's wobbly economy -- and whether that's dented the leadership's appetite for economic liberalisation. 

So far, with China's manufacturing-driven growth model flagging, the shift to consumer spending and services that the government is trying to engineer hasn't picked up the slack. 

Mr Xi sought to dispel any concern that China is faltering in its transition toward more sustainable growth: ""Like an arrow shot that cannot be brought back, we will forge ahead against all odds to meet our goals of reform."" 

On another move that surprised global markets -- a nearly 2 per cent devaluation of China's currency that fueled concerns about capital flight -- Mr Xi said the reduction in foreign reserves that followed is normal ""and there's no need to overreact to it."" 

The lead-up to summits between the US and China have become fraught in recent years, as have overall relations, as Beijing, particularly under Mr Xi, has vigorously sought to use the country's economic, military and diplomatic clout to further its increasingly global interests. Calls are rising for the Obama administration to develop better strategies to neutralise a more assertive China. 

Still, Mr Xi and Mr Obama have used their past summits to project a workmanlike relationship in public, despite friction in their behind-the-scenes discussions. 

In the interview, Mr Xi cited cooperation on pressing global issues, from agreements to reduce emissions linked to climate change and common efforts in negotiating limits to Iran's nuclear program; rather than supplanting the US, he said, China wants to work with Washington on improving global order, he said. 

""I don't believe any country is capable of rearranging the architecture of global governance toward itself,"" he said. He later added: ""Facts have shown that the interests of China and the US are increasingly intertwined."" 

On issues of contention, however, Mr Xi appeared conciliatory without giving much ground. He said his government treats all businesses fairly and brushed aside complaints by foreign business organisations that regulations are being used to hobble foreign firms, particularly US technology companies, and favour Chinese competitors. 

Mr Xi said reclamation and other construction work in the disputed South China Sea that has alarmed neighbours and the US would serve freedom of navigation -- a key US concern -- though he didn't say how. He also signaled that there would be no let-up in restrictions on the internet that have blocked several foreign media sites, including the Journal's English and Chinese editions. He also backed a proposed law that foreign nonprofit groups say would limit their ability to work with social activists. 

Mr Xi tried to counter allegations about the cybertheft of trade secrets to benefit Chinese companies -- a problem the Obama Administration is considering using sanctions to deter -- and welcomed greater engagement. 

""The Chinese government does not engage in theft of commercial secrets in any form, nor does it encourage or support Chinese companies to engage in such practices in any way,"" Mr Xi said. ""We are ready to strengthen cooperation with the US side on this issue."" 

Mr Xi seldom engages with the international media. For the written interview, the Journal submitted a dozen questions to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Mr Xi. While the ministry acknowledged that officials pulled together facts and research for the answers, it said Mr Xi revised and reviewed them.

Xi vows to 'ford dangerous rapids' in pursuit of reforms

The answers at times glint with the rhetorical flair that has differentiated President Xi from his immediate predecessors and made him popular among many Chinese. His policies having met resistance from vested interests, he vows ""to crack hard nuts and ford dangerous rapids"" in pursuit of reforms that would rely more on market-based solutions. 

Overall, though, he made it clear that the government will maintain firm regulatory hold as it allows markets broader sway in allocating resources. ""That means we need to make good use of both the invisible hand and the visible hand,"" he said. 

His current trip to America -- his first formal visit since taking office nearly three years ago -- showcases China's wider sway in the world as visits by previous Chinese leaders didn't. In Seattle, Mr Xi will see top executives of Apple, Microsoft, Boeing and other US business giants on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Mr Xi will address UN sessions over the weekend, presiding at a panel on empowering women. In between are his discussions at the White House and with members of Congress -- the optics of which, Chinese and US officials say, are important for his image back home. 

Troubling to some governments has been the rapidly improving capabilities of China's military at a time when Beijing is more forcefully asserting its maritime claims. Chinese naval vessels recently sailed into US waters in the Bering Sea, the first time the Pentagon had seen Chinese naval vessels there, just as President Obama was visiting Alaska. 

Mr Xi said China needs a military commensurate with its ""vast territorial land, sea and airspace and very long borders."" 

The Chinese military, he said, has benefited the world, contributing more peacekeepers to UN missions than other permanent Security Council members and taking part in the removal of chemical weapons from Syria. 

""In strengthening our defence and military building, we are not going after some kind of military adventure. It never crosses our mind,"" he said. ""China has no military base in Asia and stations no troops outside its borders."" 

Even as the Chinese navy operates farther from home shores, Mr Xi has also worked to improve communications with the US military. The two sides have reached several agreements, one on rules of behaviour when naval surface vessels meet at sea. A similar pact on air encounters is under discussion. Mr Xi said he's looking for more areas of convergence and to lessen the chances for conflict. 

""The Asia-Pacific should be a cooperative ground for enhanced China-US coordination and collaboration rather than their Coliseum for supremacy,"" Mr Xi said. 

Mr Xi offered to extend cooperation to the infrastructure development bank that Beijing founded, joined by US allies like Britain and Germany despite initial objections from Washington. Mr Xi welcomed the US to become a member. 

While saying repeatedly that China remains open to foreigners and foreign businesses, he also said that the internet must be carefully regulated to ""safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests."" 

Under Mr Xi, arrests and prosecutions of people for spreading what authorities consider rumours have had the effect of subduing social media. 

""Freedom and order must be upheld side by side in both cyberspace and the physical world. Freedom is the purpose of order, and order the guarantee of freedom,"" he said. Though he didn't directly address the block on foreign news sites, he said foreign companies must ""do nothing to undermine China's national interests and interests of consumers."" 

Still, Mr Xi said nations must remain open and willing to learn from other civilisations. One of Mr Xi's catchiest slogans has been the ""Chinese dream"" -- the effort to restore China to what many Chinese see as the position of global primacy the Middle Kingdom held for centuries before being eclipsed by the West. The country then slipped into a century of foreign aggression, civil war and social and political upheaval. 

""To understand today's China, one needs to fully appreciate the Chinese nation's deep suffering since modern times and the profound impact of such suffering on the Chinese minds,"" he said. He added: ""Every country and every nation has a dream, and dream brings hope."". Zipcar to Launch at 100 Colleges and Universities in 2015.

Volkswagen shares slid more than 34 percent this week following news that the German automaker would stop selling its ""clean diesel"" cars in the U.S. Last week, environmental regulators accused the company of installing software to evade emissions standards. 

					 
Monday was the biggest one-day drop for VW since February 2009, and losses amounted to about $15 billion in market value . That's some amazing movement, especially considering that it's about 482,000 cars in the U.S. that are involved in the alleged misdeeds. 

					 
Data show that VW's drop is unusual for automakers involved in big recalls. A Big Crunch analysis suggests that investors in the past decades have not been significantly bothered by market associated with auto recalls. 

					  
												
																		
	 
						
																										
						
						
															
																						

	
	

	

	    
	
 
															
						
				  
Overall, there isn't a pattern of losses or gains in the first 30 days after a recall report is filed in the  database. Automakers tended to be down a year afterward. 

					 
Of course, the market often moves independently of major recalls. If we adjust for the movement of the indexed S&P 500 , the average change after a recall is close to nothing—and there is little evidence of investors' dumping their stocks immediate before or after a recall campaign is made public. 

					 
The biggest recall in U.S. history was of 21 million Ford and Mercury vehicles in 1981. The cars and light trucks had faulty parking brakes that would indicate that they were engaged but would not actually work. The share price fell just 7 percent in the month following the recall's announcement and 15 percent over the year. 

					 
To repeat, that's 21 million vehicles recalled and a 15 percent drop over 12 months. Nothing like a 34 percent drop in two days over less than half a million potentially recalled cars. 

					  
												
																		
	 
						
																										
						
						
															
																						

	
	

	

	    
	
 
															
						
				  
Ford's share price rebounded and more than tripled over the five years after the massive recall. 

					 
Ford also saw the opposite—their share price leap after a large recall. In 2009, the company recalled 4.5 million vehicles of Ford and Mercury models with faulty wiring. A Texas Instruments -made speed control deactivation switch could overheat and catch fire, something that could happen whether or not the car was actually running at the time. 

					 
Ford's share price leapt 17.6 percent in a month of trading following the recall announcement. A year later, the stock had increased 91 percent in value.

While the approximately 482,000 VW and Audi cars in the U.S. affected by the EPA's allegations are far fewer than the millions recalled in the largest campaigns, the costs could be far greater. 

					 
In the quest to create ""clean diesel"" cars with both high fuel efficiency and low emissions, VW seems to have found a short-cut: cheating. According to EPA , the company admitted to using software to game emissions tests, keeping emissions within legal limits during laboratory conditions but exceeding them by as much as  out on the road. 

					 
The understandably irate EPA has the power to fine the company as much as $18 billion—more than six times the company's  in 2014. Citing anonymous sources,  that VW was under a criminal investigation by the Justice Department in association with skirting the emissions testing. On Tuesday,  another 11 million diesel cars worldwide were installed with the same software. Some 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) have been set aside to deal with the cleanup, VW said in a statement. 

					 
And the damage isn't a one-time problem. Not only could the company's reputation be seriously harmed, but the company has thousands of TDI clean diesel cars that can't be sold. Those models accounted for 22 percent of  last year. 

					 
 How long can the Saudis hold on with cheap oil?. Ford research project to work on near-zero particulate emission diesel cars. A consortium that includes the Ford European Research & Innovation Center is working on a €3.5m (£2.6m) project that could lead to the development of diesel cars that run on converted CO2 and offer extremely low particulate emissions and enhanced fuel efficiency. 

The three-year project, which is co-funded by the German government, will develop the first passenger cars, based on a Ford Mondeo, to run on environmentally friendly dimethyl ether (DME), and oxymethylene ether (OME1)

Both fuels can be generated from CO2 captured from the air that is combined with wind and sun power, or waste products.

The technology is being investigated in a parallel project together with RWTH Aachen University researching the viability of different DME generation methods, looking at conversion efficiency, estimated fuel prices and infrastructure aspects.

“The CO2 produced by a car powered by DME from renewable sources could be comparable to the amount generated by a marathon runner covering the same distance – but with performance similar to a diesel powered vehicle,” said Werner Willems, technical specialist , Powertrain Combustion Systems, Ford of Europe. “This is a project that could help place vehicles with a significantly reduced carbon dioxide and particulate emissions on the market at affordable costs.”. Shelby GT EcoBoost Mustang. review photos (6) Videos Specifications:year: 2016make: Ford Model: Mustang price: $ 23995 Engine:inline-4 Horsepower @ RPM:335 Displacement:2.3 L 0-60 time:6 sec. Top Speed:155 mph (Est.) Posted on 09.14.2015 09:00 by Jacob Joseph   The Shelby name has been attached to a lot of different kinds of cars from different manufacturers and with different kinds of engines. But so far, Shelby Mustangs have all been powered by V-8s. Displacements and power outputs have varied by a lot, and some have been naturally aspirated while others have used forced induction, but it has always been a V-8. That all changes this year, as Shelby has just announced a Shelby GT package for the EcoBoost Mustang. The package will be available in North America, but it is intended to appeal primarily to customers in other parts of the world. This is why the car will make its first public appearance at the Goodwood Revival in the U.K., also marking the official European debut of Shelby International.
To a lot of Americans, the idea of a four-cylinder Shelby Mustang might seem blasphemous; but for those living in other countries, particularly in Europe, V-8 Mustangs may be out of reach due to huge price increases caused by tax and insurance regulations. The GT EcoBoost is therefore a way for Europeans to be able to buy a Shelby Mustang without having to pay near-supercar prices for it.
Continue reading to learn more about the Shelby GT EcoBoost Mustang.
continue reading Exterior
The GT EcoBoost package is not cheap, and the exterior changes are extensive. Many of the upgrades are the same as the ones found on packages offered on V-8 Mustangs. This includes the extensive use of carbon fiber, notable in the front splitter, hood, rear spoiler and rocker panel. There are bigger wheels, which now completely fill the wheel arches, and the usual stripe package that you would expect from a Shelby. The grille has been changed and has much more of a ’60s race car look to it, similar to that of the V-8 GT, but still noticeably different. It’s quite an aggressive look, but that’s what you want in a Shelby Mustang.Interior
Shelby makes no mention of any changes to the interior of the car, but it’s safe to assume that the same option list as other Mustangs will be offered. The package comes with essentially nothing as standard, but with the kinds of performance-oriented options you’d expect: racing seats, five-point harnesses, gauge pods and a roll cage are all on the list, but can quickly add several thousand to the price. But as sports cars go, the Mustang has a good interior as it is, and the many options for it that are available from Ford should keep customers happy.Drivetrain
This is generally where Shelby cars shine, but this time around the engine hasn’t been changed all that much. The GT EcoBoost is putting out just 25 extra horsepower, up to 335, with the upgrade. It’s not entirely clear whether this had to do with EU carbon emissions regulations or what, but the press release does at one point say that the bump in performance hasn’t altered the car’s fuel economy numbers. The car has instead been modified to be lighter, and Shelby says that it now handles considerably better.
There are upgraded brakes, and a Ford Performance handling pack upgraded suspension. The exhaust has also been replaced with a system that Shelby calls “throatier.” It’s kind of disappointing that Shelby hasn’t turned the EcoBoost Mustang into some kind of screaming 500-horsepower beast, but the truth is that this isn’t too far off from the treatment given to the original 1967 Ford Shelby Mustang GT350 back in 1965. There was a mild power bump for that one too, but the tuning concentrated more on reducing weight and improving handling.Prices
The GT EcoBoost will set you back $23,995, plus the cost of the car, which starts at about $30,000. But that’s U.S. pricing For countries on the euro, it starts at 37,000 (about $42,000) and its £30,000 price tag in the U.K. is equal to about $46,000. V-8 Mustang prices easily clear the $50,000 equivalent mark for both currencies, and it’s easy to see why the tremendous amounts that taxes and insurance add to that would price a V-8 Shelby out of competition for any but the most diehard of fans. The GT EcoBoost is still quite expensive, even in the U.S. it could easily double the price of the car once you start selecting optional equipment, but it does manage to stay in a price range where European sales aren’t impossible.Competition2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA 45 AMG Since the GT EcoBoost is meant primarily for Europe, we should take a look at some of the European competition. One of the big criticisms that the CLA 45 AMG usually faces is that it’s a bit too expensive for a four-cylinder performance car, but that isn’t such a big deal anymore, when compared to the Shelby. You get 40 more horses with the Mercedes , but the styling isn’t nearly as aggressive and there are two extra doors.
Read our full review here .2014 BMW M235i This will likely be the car to beat for the Shelby. While the Shelby is cheaper than a 2015 BMW M4 by enough not to be threatened by it, the M235i is cheaper than the Shelby by at least as much and offers very nearly the same kind of power. Handling is superb as well, and will probably be a close rival to that of the GT EcoBoost. Personal taste will be the reason why anyone chooses the Shelby over the BMW .
Read our full review here .Conclusion
After its European debut, Shelby plans to open up operations in South Africa, China and Australia. The V-8 models will probably be a bigger hit in Australia, but on the whole, it’s hard to argue with the GT EcoBoost as a business decision. Because even if every single person on the planet was completely enamored of the V-8 Shelbys, there are just some markets where it isn’t going to work out all that well. The GT EcoBoost produces more power than the first Shelby Mustangs too, as well as quite a few other cars that have worn Shelby badges. It’s probably not going to be a big hit in the U.S., true, but that’s no reason to make it overly difficult for Europeans to own Shelby Mustangs.

Press Release
Shelby American, a wholly owned subsidiary of Carroll Shelby International Inc. (CSBI.PK) is expanding its vehicle lineup for global customers by offering a Shelby GT version of the popular EcoBoost model 2015-2016 Ford Mustang. The new car will debut this fall, just after the Goodwood Revival kicks off the company’s official European debut.
“Ever since Ford announced that its terrific new Mustang would be available worldwide, requests for Shelby versions of the car have rolled in from across the globe,” said Joe Conway, Co-CEO of Carroll Shelby International and CEO of Shelby American. “Since the majority of Mustangs that Ford offers in many of those countries will be the EcoBoost model, our team has been developing a Shelby GT model for the nimble new turbocharged four cylinder car, as well as the V8 powered GT. This package was specifically developed for the recently announced network of Shelby Mod Shops that will stretch from Europe to South Africa, China and Australia. They will add the Shelby package to a Ford Mustang that a customer has purchased in that area.”
Like the manual and automatic transmission 5.0 liter model Shelby GT, the EcoBoost version of the car is far more than stripes and a badge. Shelby American spent significant time developing the car, putting it through extensive testing on the track. The car was refined with a Ford Performance handling pack upgrade, engine tune and a throatier Ford Performance exhaust. The result is over 335 horsepower on 91 octane fuel and significantly better handling.
“Shelby American has delivered a car that not only provides superior handling, it has smooth progressive power and great braking capabilities,” said Vince LaViolette, SAI lead designer and factory test driver. “Yet it doesn’t negate the EcoBoost’s outstanding fuel economy. And the car offers the aggressive styling of the new Shelby GT that enthusiasts demand.”
The $23,995 starting price (not including the base EcoBoost Mustang) includes performance upgrades to the suspension, a least 20 more horsepower, a new exhaust, bigger wheels and tires. Aesthetically, the car will also share some of the treatments from the V8 version of the Shelby GT including a carbon fiber front splitter, hood, rear spoiler and rocker panel. A list of additional performance options are also available including even more aggressive brakes, stronger half shafts, more cooling, brake ducts, etc.
“The Shelby GT EcoBoost is the perfect step into a Shelby Mustang platform for customers around the world,” said Akos Feher, Vice President of Operations. “We now offer Mustang owners everything from aggressive Shelby carbon fiber aesthetic touches to legendary tuning and performance for both the V8 and EcoBoost cars.”
Ford’s family of turbocharged, direct injection EcoBoost four-cylinder was designed to deliver power and torque consistent with those of larger displacement, naturally aspirated engines while achieving approximately 20 percent better fuel efficiency and 15 percent reduced greenhouse emissions.
“The Shelby GT EcoBoost is designed to appeal to a new Shelby enthusiast audience,” said Gary Schechner, Shelby American Vice President Marketing and Sales. “While we believe that Americans will embrace the car, we expect significant demand from this platform internationally where the availability of the V8 Mustang GT may be more limited or taxes and tariffs might prevent ownership of the V8 engine.”
The Shelby GT EcoBoost package starts at $23,995, not including the base car. More information is available at www.Shelby.com or by calling (702) 942-7325. Shelby American will be accepting deposits on a first-come, first-served basis.

It's generally agreed that the humble automobile is going to change more in the next twenty years than it has in the 107 years since the first Model T rolled off Henry Ford's production line, the only uncertainty being the pace of that change. 

It's likely there will be two phases of evolution: in the near future we'll see the bolting on of ever-more-sophisticated automation and nosy sensors, from self-parking to stop\/start traffic jam autopilots to hands-off motorway cruising and finally, full automation. 

Phase two will likely see car ownership beginning to be phased out – instead you'll whip out your smartphone and hail a smart car for a particular trip. You'll be ushered to your destination at briskly efficient speeds made possible by the stage direction of some hive mind on a server somewhere, controlling a vast network of vehicles. 

A peek into our near future throws up a miscellany of smart delights that we can look forward to in our Blade Runner-esque Volkswagen, Ford or GM car – if those companies haven't been class-actioned and fined out of existence following another wave of emissions shenanigans. 

Here's a taste of things to come… 
AR windscreens 
Cars have packed heads-up displays for years, with GM the first to implement this feature back in 1988, in its Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme saloon. But genuine, full-fat augmented reality displays are coming. 

Alongside the obvious speed readout and satnav directions, the screen will integrate information from the car's sensors, highlighting potential hazards such as cyclists, pedestrians stepping into to road, and even nearby animals with visual and audible alerts. 



You want night vision? Infrared cameras will scan the road ahead and enhance the view you see through the windscreen to pick out road signs and hazards, enabling you to speed through the dark with bat-like assuredness. 

Cotton-thin screens linked to external cameras will be arrayed on your car's pillars, projecting an unhindered 360-degree view. And rather than relying on the satnav you'll be able to follow a 'ghost car' that's projected onto the windscreen and appears to be in the road front of you, like Jaguar's here… 

[embedded content] 
Biometric driver tracking 
Essentially, this means your car will be spying on you, to make sure you're in a fit state to drive. Your heartbeat can be measured via the steering wheel or your seatbelt, alongside your breathing rate, and an in-dash camera will track your blink rate and glance frequency. 



If your car decides that you're showing signs of tiredness it'll flash a warning message onto the windscreen, or even navigate to a rest stop and shut the car down if it decides you're too tired to continue. 

BMW and Mercedes have already created sensors that learn your driving style and can sense, purely by your inputs, when you're too tired to drive. Yes, your car will become your mum. 
Gesture control 
Concept car makers are big fans of this, with VW especially going large on it in their concept cars. The idea is that internal sensors track your hands for split seconds when they're off the wheel, and translate your gestures into inputs. 



So if you want to turn the radio up you take your hand from the wheel, mime a radio dial being turned –and hey presto! Maximum Bieber. This could also work for changing radio stations and selecting CD tracks, and adjusting the air con. 
Smart connections 
We're not talking about mere satnav traffic reports here – when your car is part of an internet network there are all sorts of smart ways it can help you. For example it can calculate the amount of fuel you have left in the tank, work out if it's enough for you to reach your destination, and, if not, scan ahead to find the fuel stop with the best prices on your route and direct you to it.. New Ford Focus RS: 345bhp mega hatch on sale now from £28,940. The new Ford Focus RS is nearly here, and its competitors will certainly have something to worry about when it arrives. Ford has revealed that the four-wheel drive super hatch will cost from just £28,940, and is available to order from dealers right now.

After making its public debut at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, the Ford Focus RS has been setting the public imagination alight. Everyone has been anxious to hear and see its full potential. Now we’re one step closer as the Blue Oval has revealed full performance figures: The RS is capable of 0-62mph in 4.7 seconds and goes on to a top speed of 165mph.

That’s partly thanks to the 2.3-litre EcoBoost turbo petrol engine, which pumps out 345bhp and 470Nm of torque, and also due to the clever torque vectoring four-wheel drive system helping it shoot off the line.

The benchmark sprint time is a whole second faster that its front-wheel drive rival, the more expensive Honda Civic Type R, and strips 0.4 seconds off the BMW M135i. The Audi RS3 is half a second quicker to 62mph, but demand more than £10,000 extra for the privilege. 

The new Focus RS will come with a drift mode function: 70 per cent of power can be sent to the rears with all of that power able to be sent to one wheel if needed. 

• We ride up the Goodwood hill in the Focus RS with Ken Block Image 2 of 34

Bowing to pressure from key rivals like the Audi RS3 and Mercedes A 45 AMG, Ford’s Performance division has fitted a sophisticated four-wheel-drive system to give optimum traction. The new Focus RS hot hatchback was designed with four-wheel drive in mind from the start to elevate the car to new levels of performance and driver involvement. 

Speaking to Auto Express at the unveiling of the new car, vice president global vehicle development, Raj Nair, told us that the Focus’s clever all-wheel drive system debuts a host of innovations for the brand and was needed to cope with the high power level of the car’s 2.3-litre four-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost engine.

• Best hot hatchbacks to buy now

“Cost didn’t come into it,” said Nair. “It wasn’t a case of engineers vs accountants, but that we wanted to make an affordable performance vehicle with the best technology possible – it needs to be a percentage above an ST. That’s what an RS should be about.” Image 20 of 34

The first major innovation is the hottest Focus’s new electronically controlled twin-clutch four-wheel drive system. An aptly named 'drift' function allows up to 70 per cent of power to be sent to the rear wheels, with as much as 100 per cent of that driving torque sent to one individual wheel.

“This way you get great steering response but incredible pull out of the corner – and we can use the torque vectoring to keep the car safe and stable all the way through a bend.” 

The second major innovation on the new RS Focus is the low weight of the new four-wheel drive transmission. It’s thought the system only adds around 20kg to the car – a similar weight penalty to that which the clever RevoKnuckle front suspension setup added on the last generation RS. However, with Ford’s latest Dynamic Torque Vectoring system, RevoKnuckle is now redundant. 

Under the standard Focus bonnet lies a 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine, which will be shared with this year’s Mustang. But, unlike the US muscle car, the hatch gets a twin-scroll turbo with a larger compressor for better airflow, as well as a larger intercooler. And we’re assured those sawn-off twin exhausts will emit deep-throated gargles, pops and crackles. Image 3 of 34

Power is 345bhp – that’s 17bhp less than the 2.5-litre five-cylinder delivers in the RS3 but there could be the potential to up power even further in future with a limited-run model. The 2.3-litre EcoBoost ‘red lines’ at 6,800rpm, CO2 emissions are down 20 per cent on the old RS’s Volvo-derived 2.5 five-cylinder and a six-speed manual box is standard.

As with most four-wheel drive cars, there will be an efficiency penalty. “We’re not ready to talk fuel economy numbers just yet,” vehicle development boss Raj Nair explained, adding that, “economy and emissions will be significantly better than we’ve seen in previous RS products.” This means the new car could achieve as much as 35mpg.

• Geneva Motor Show 2015: preview

Focusing on “functional aerodynamics” has helped Ford improve efficiency by reducing drag and adding downforce to improve grip and handling.

The car’s muscular bodykit – including a redesigned front bumper, grille and large rear spoiler – has been developed with this in mind and to aid cooling of the retuned engine.

UK dealers shifted nearly 4,600 examples of the previous RS between 2009 and 2011, and Ford has similarly high hopes with this Mk3. Prices dip under the £30k barrier for the standard car, which will come with 19-inch alloys, Brembo brakes, Recaro sports seats and a range of sporty design touches; sat-nav and Recaro bucket seats will be optional, as will semi-slick track tyres. Image 10 of 34

Ford has confirmed that the Liquid Blue colour on the car in our pictures is only for the show model, but it’s promising a new Nitrous Blue paint will be similar. Stealth Grey, Absolute Black and Frozen White will also appear, but the last RS’s Ultimate Green finish has been dropped.

On the outside, it’s clear to see the RS is a serious piece of kit. The flared nose and rear spoiler hint at supercar-beating performance, but it’s a more restrained look overall than its predecessor. And for that you have One Ford to blame – or thank, depending on your viewpoint. Image 4 of 34

This Focus RS will be the first to be available all around the world, rather than sold only in certain markets. Not surprisingly, the image of previous models – with their big wings, large wheels and gaping air scoops – doesn’t translate that well internationally. But with a five-door body from the humdrum Focus, the new RS is more reserved than the previous model from six years ago.

“We were told by the marketing department that we had to tone down the styling,” explained Ernesto Rupar, Ford of Europe’s supervisor for exterior design. “It was felt the old RS’s look would be over the top for this new car. Everything you see on the new RS has been added for a purpose; there’s nothing unnecessary.

“We went through around five designs to get to this – one of the designs had air vents on the bonnet, but they had no real purpose so they went.”

The Focus’ five-door layout has also prevented the use of a rally car-like wide body – a look that was so distinctive on the Focus RS Mk2. “We would have to have changed the door pressings to give it a wide body look, and that just wasn’t on the agenda,” said Rupar. “So, with no wide body, we had to concentrate on making the front and rear as sporty-looking as possible. Image 19 of 34

“We were looking at the RS3 and its classy style. We didn’t want to make this car look like a boy racer’s car.” The front bumper is bespoke and has massive air vents at the corners that lead up to the gaping, flared grille. In the lower grille opening, even the intercooler is visible – a clear motorsport design cue.

• Ford Focus RS Cosworth - Most Wanted Cars 2014

Along the side, the RS details are few and far between – it’s a near Focus ST copy. The Mk2’s distinctive side vents with integrated RS badging have gone, too – the blue RS letters have moved to the rear spoiler’s end plates. “We wanted to get the RS badge somewhere on the side, and I suggested the rear spoiler,” said a beaming Rupar. “My dream car as a kid was the Ferrari F40 and that car had ‘F40’ on the wing, so I wanted it on the RS, too!” Image 12 of 34

The spoiler is just one part of the rear end’s substantial makeover, however. The bumper – with its incorporated air diffuser, reversing light and two angled exhausts – is almost a carbon copy of the set-up on the old RS.

Full specifications will be revealed when the car makes its global debut at the Geneva Motor Show next month. But for now, it’s clear to see the RS is back – and back with an almighty bang.

The new Focus RS is the latest member of the burgeoning mega-hatch market - cars that seemingly defy convention with huge power outputs normally the reserve of sports cars and performance coupes.

• Invasion of the mega-hatches

It's not the only one, though. Here we reveal the other showroom-fresh performance models Ford will have to take on over the coming months...

Engine: 2.0-litre 4cyl, front-wheel drive

Power: 306bhp 

The new Civic Type-R will be fighting for the headlines with the Focus RS when they debut alongisde each other at the Geneva Motor Show. Front-wheel drive and VTEC power could surprise. 

Engine: 2.0-litre 4cyl, four-wheel drive

Power: 355bhp

The little mega-Mercedes A 45 is the benchmark performance hatch, but tuning arm AMG is considering increasing power to 375bhp in the near future. 

Engine: 2.5-litre 5cyl, four-wheel drive

Power: 362bhp

Latest Audi RS3 packs huge power and great practicality. The tuneful five-cylinder engine is great, although the estimated £40,000 price tag is a bit steep. 

Engine: 2.0-litre 4cyl, four-wheel drive

Power: 395bhp

VW hasn't confirmed it's building the uber-hot Golf R400 yet, but the signs look good. Top speed would be limited to 174mph, with a 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. 

The new Ford Focus RS has some stiff competition on its hands. These are the 10 best hot hatchbacks currently on sale.. 2016 Land Rover Range Rover Sport Td6 Diesel. Before Land Rover allowed us to drive the new diesel-powered Range Rover Sport , we were told that no one in a single focus group identified its new Td6 powerplant as a diesel engine. “Sure,” we thought, “but these are probably the same kind of rubes who might bite into a red onion thinking it’s an apple.” 
 
Arriving at dealerships this fall, the new 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6 will command a $1500 premium over the gasoline-powered supercharged V-6 Range Rover Sport. Dubbed Td6, it makes 254 horsepower at 4000 rpm and 440 lb-ft of torque at 1750 rpm. Interestingly, this 60-degree V-6 is a design that dates back to 2004 and the days when Ford owned Land Rover—in fact, Ford still builds the engine for Land Rover even though it doesn’t power any product with a Blue Oval. 
        
The Td6 powers about 90 percent of Land Rovers in Europe; to cross the Atlantic, the engine had to be cleaned up with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system that takes a urea-based fluid and injects it into the exhaust flow to reduce NOx emissions. To further reduce NOx emissions, the engine uses low-pressure exhaust-gas recirculation that runs through an engine-mounted cooler before reentering the combustion chamber. 
 
To give some credit to the focus groupies, there actually aren’t too many clues that this particular Range Rover Sport uses diesel power. The most noticeable tells are a small Td6 badge on the hatch and a light ticking from under the hood. Yet even from outside it doesn’t sound much louder than some direct-injected gasoline engines. 
 
There aren’t very many signs in normal everyday driving, either. There’s a 4800-rpm redline and the power delivery definitely favors the low end, while running through the eight-speed automatic’s first couple of gears reveals that the party is over by 4000 rpm. But keep it below 4000 rpm and the boost comes on in a smooth and very nearly effortless manner, even at part throttle. 
 
At full throttle, Land Rover claims a believable zero-to-60-mph time of 7.1 seconds, a couple of tenths behind the stated sprint for the supercharged gasoline V-6. To the 15 to 20 percent of Range Rover Sport customers who are expected to opt for the diesel, the fuel-economy numbers of 22 mpg city and 28 highway are what will be really important—the gas V-6 returns 17 and 23. The Sport’s 23.5-gallon tank makes an uninterrupted 658-mile drive possible in the diesel at the rated highway mileage. 
        
Those 600-plus-miles would certainly be pleasant ones. An acoustic windshield, double-paned side glass, unique engine mounts, and a new firewall design muffle the clatter endemic to diesels. From the driver’s seat, there’s simply no audible clue that the engine is transforming compression ignition into propulsion. Alright, we’ll admit it. Whether they know it or not, the folks who attended those clinics for free scones and a $20 Lululemon gift card got this one right: This is a seriously quiet, refined, and subtle diesel. 
 
In bringing over the diesel engine, Land Rover has left the rest of the Sport pretty much alone. The SUV retains its evocative leather and shiny wood, off-road prowess, a high-\/low-range transfer case, and the standard air suspension that lifts or lowers the vehicle at the push of a button. As part of the Sport’s 2016 updates , new this year is All-Terrain Progress Control (ATPC). When in use, ATPC lets the Land Rover crawl over obstacles or through slippery terrain without the help of the driver. Basically, you set the speed using the cruise-control buttons on the steering wheel and ATPC figures out the rest. It even works to control speed while descending, but unlike hill-descent control, ATPC operates only at very low speeds. 
 
The new diesel is available in the Sport’s SE and HSE trim levels, and it opens at $67,445. That’s a not-insignificant chunk of money, but the larger Range Rover diesel with the same engine starts at more than $87,000, making the sweet Sport Td6 seem like a bargain, relatively speaking. 
 
 View Photos    View Photos. Which is better? Ford Fiesta ST vs Vauxhall Corsa VRX. Ford’s Fiesta ST has reigned supreme over the hot hatch market for far too long – according to the latest Corsa VRX, at least. The high-performance Vauxhall has launched an all-out bid to overthrow the king. Can it succeed? 
 
Such is the sensational Ford Fiesta ST’s hold on the hot hatch market, that accomplished contenders from top rival brands have consistently tried and failed to claim its crown. Now it’s the turn of Vauxhall’s new Corsa VXR. To rate its chances, we compare them in a whirlwind head-to-head. 
 
First things first: cold, hard figures. The Corsa 1.6i 205 Turbo VXR is £400 cheaper than the Fiesta 1.6T 180 Ecoboost ST-2, at £17,995. Sounds good? Yes – but don’t expect any dealer discounts just yet. The Vauxhall is far too new. Haggle over the Ford, on the other hand, and you’ll get a grand or more off. The market leader has got better economy and lower emissions as well, which will reflect in cheaper running costs. 
 
 
 
What about performance? Hot hatches aren’t just about straight-line pace – and if they were, surprisingly the Fiesta ST wouldn’t be top of the list. No, they’ve got to sound amazing, shift gears with slick ferocity and steer sublimely. Here, the Ford ticks all the boxes. 
 
Meanwhile, the gutsy VXR packs a punch with its superior 202bhp, racy looks and comparable spec. Is it equally engaging behind the wheel, though? Well... no, not really. Its thrills per mile aren’t as abundant as its extra muscle would indicate on paper, and neither does it sound as beguiling as the 180bhp Ford under full revs. 
 
Compared to the ST’s precise, engaging controls, the Vauxhall’s transmission is less positive and its clutch not as eager. Meanwhile, cornering fun is somewhat inhibited by what feels like excess travel in the brake pedal, as well as overly light steering that simply doesn’t weight up or transmit as accurately as the Ford’s pin-sharp set-up. 
 
Handling is a Fiesta forte. Its flat, composed stance through the twisties, whatever the surface, is in contrast to the Corsa’s less well controlled body and a rear end that shuffles around at the hint of a mid-bend bump. Both cars have a firm ride, but when it comes to corners the Fiesta reaffirms its claim to the crown. 
 
 
 
The Ford doesn’t have everything its own way, however. Its cabin has neither the quality nor the classy user-friendliness of the Vauxhall. It does claw back kudos when it comes to driving position, though; we defy you not to get comfortable whatever your size, whereas lanky pilots may well suffer in the VXR. Where both cabins score a draw is that neither imparts an especially racy vibe. 
 
So everything comes down to fun behind the wheel – and the involving Fiesta has done more than enough to retain its place on the hot hatch throne. Loyal subjects rejoice; hail Ford’s all-conquering king.

For more information, visit www.greenbuildermedia.com.. CO2 a fuel for future vehicles?. If an alternative fuel research project headed by Ford works out, we could all be breathing easier and CO2  could become a valuable resource rather than a potential climate threat. 
 
The goal is a fuel wth the performance of regular engines with the environmental benefits of an electric vehicle. 
 
The three-year €3.5 million project, co-funded by the German government, will test the first cars to run on dimethyl ether (DME), commonly used as a non-toxic propellant in aerosol spray gas, and oxymethylene ether (OME1), a liquid usually used as a solvent in the chemical industry. 
 
Both will power cars based on the Ford Mondeo and have the potential for extremely low particulate emissions and enhanced fuel efficiency. They can be generated from fossil natural gas or bio-gas or through a sophisticated process that uses renewable sources such as solar or wind power together with CO2 captured from the air. 
 
The technology is being investigated in a parallel project with RWTH Aachen University researching the viability of different DME generation methods, looking at conversion efficiency, estimated fuel prices and infrastructure aspects. 
 
“The CO2 produced by a car powered by DME from renewable sources could be comparable to the amount generated by a marathon runner covering the same distance – but with performance similar to a diesel powered vehicle,” says Werner Willems,  Ford of Europe Powertrain Combustion Systems technical specialist adding that the project could result in affordable vehicles with significantly reduced carbon dioxide and particulate emissions. 
 
Both DME and OME1 produce almost no particulates and share characteristics with diesel fuel that are expected to make conversion of diesel engines possible. 
 
It is estimated that DME from renewable energy sources could offer well-to-wheel emissions of about 3 g\/km CO2. DME must be stored in a slightly pressurised tank while OME1 can be stored in a conventional tank. DME-powered engines are expected have almost soot-free combustion, higher thermal efficiency and excellent cold start properties. 
 
Ford’s European Research & Innovation Center in Aachen, Germany, will work with RWTH Aachen University, the Technical University of Munich, FVV, TUEV, DENSO, IAV Automotive Engineering, and Oberon Fuels. The project findings will be shared with key-players within the automotive industry. 
 
“The growth of the world’s population is putting ever-increasing demands on energy and especially fossil fuels. Alternative, renewable fuels like methyl ethers will play a pivotal role in the future,” says Andreas Schamel, Ford’s director Global Powertrain Research & Advanced Engineering. “DME is safe, burns cleaner than conventional diesel, and most importantly is versatile. The energy generated from solar, wind and other renewables can be stored within the fuel itself, and this enables DME and OME1 to be used across a range of applications.” 
 
DME from Oberon has received EPA approval as a biogas-based fuel in the U.S.. Enthusiasm for cars and environment. Sept. 30 — To the Editor: Are you a car and truck enthusiast like me? Give me a big-block Chevy and I'll show you a happy face (sorry Ford owners). I also like being outside and hiking, so the thought that the fuel I am burning in my car is causing the climate to change bothers me. What - you don't think the climate is changing? Hey, the same scientists that were smart enough to develop the atomic bomb say fossil fuels are a threat. Even the Pope is taking notice to climate change and the threat to our world. You also may have heard about the Department of Defenses’ recent report indicating that climate change is starting to cause stress to vulnerable nations including the US. Some people think it will cost US taxpayers billions of dollars to counter this instability. My taxes are already high enough, thank you! One solution that economists like and has bipartisan support is to place a fee on producers for the amount of carbon in energy. The fee would start small and increase incrementally each year. One hundred percent of the fee would go back to you and me. The money back in our pockets would add 2.8 million jobs and stimulate the economy. Importantly, the carbon fee would not increase the size of government or its revenues. With this one step we could reduce CO2 emissions to a safe level. Brett Gibson Durham. 2016 Ford Focus Electric.

Front Wheel Drive $ 27,202 $ 29,170 The Basics:
The 2016 Ford Focus Electric, now in its fifth model year, remains the only battery-electric car sold by Ford anywhere in the world. It's the most energy-efficient car the company sells. The compact five-door hatchback is an adaptation of a gasoline model, built on the same assembly line in Michigan as all other North American Focuses, but it's sold only in small numbers in specific regions--and only in low numbers. The Focus Electric competes with the Nissan Leaf, by far the world's highest-volume electric car, as well as the Volkswagen e-Golf, both of them similarly all-electric compact hatchbacks. Ford's electric Focus also faces off against a handful of smaller electric cars from other makers--the Chevy Spark EV, Fiat 500e, and Mitsubishi i-MiEV--also sold only in small numbers in limited markets. Over five model years, the electric Focus has changed very little. While it was initially distinguished by a unique grille design, a 2015 restyle of the gasoline Focus gave the whole lineup the same look. Now, aside from a couple of chrome ""Electric"" door badges and the charging port on the left front fender, you'd never know just by looking that the Focus Electric has no engine. The sole change to the 2016 model is the addition of Ford's latest Sync 3 infotainment system, which promises an easier-to-use interface and menu design than the much-reviled MyFord Touch system it replaces. The powertrain of the Focus Electric remains a 23-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack that provides energy to a 107-kilowatt (143-horsepower) electric motor that drives the front wheels. The battery cells are provided by Korean maker LG Chem, which supplies similar cells for the Chevrolet Volt range-extended electric car--meaning that Ford has piggybacked on GM's extensive cell test and development work. The Focus Electric pack is liquid-cooled--unlike that of the Nissan Leaf, which is only air-cooled--and that should make it somewhat more resistant to temperature extremes. On the road, the motor is powerful enough to spin the inside front wheel when accelerating out of turns. Ford has tuned the regenerative braking to be somewhat on the aggressive side, but its acceleration and deceleration will still be relatively familiar to drivers used to automatic-transmission cars. Despite several hundred pounds of extra weight, the Focus Electric has the same enjoyable roadholding of the gasoline Focus models. Its weight sits low, with the battery under the floorpan, so the car feels well planted, and its torque makes it a particularly good car for urban traffic jousting. It does start to run out of steam under heavy load approaching highway speeds, say above 50 mph. It runs well enough on the highway, but like most electrics, it's punchiest away from stoplights. The EPA rates the Focus Electric at 76 miles of range (on combined city and highway cycles) and 105 MPGe, or miles-per-gallon-equivalent, an efficiency measure that specifies the distance a car can travel electrically on the same amount of energy as in 1 gallon of gasoline. While the efficiency is about average for the class, the range is slightly lower than the comparable Leaf (84 miles) or VW e-Golf (83 miles). That discrepancy will become more marked when a model of the 2016 Nissan Leaf is launched with more than 100 miles of rated range. Because its charger operates at up to 6.6 KW, for Focus Electric can fully recharge its battery pack in no more than four hours when using a 240-volt Level 2 charging station. The Focus Electric offers no option for DC quick charging, however, which the Nissan Leaf and VW e-Golf do. Inside, the Focus Electric is largely identical to any other Focus five-door hatchback. There are different screens in the digital instrument cluster display and center-stack display, of course, showing energy consumption and remaining range. The main difference--or drawback--inside the electric version of the Focus is in the rear load bay, due to the onboard charger sitting in a box that spans the area between the rear wheel arches, creating a hump perhaps 10 inches high. Ford has fitted a clever movable floor that either tilts down to meet the bottom of the hatchback opening or lifts up to provide a level floor in what remains of the load space, but it's a major compromise. The Focus Electric was launched at a price of $40,000, but as electric-car prices have fallen, Ford has had to follow suit. The car now starts at about $30,000, very much line with the base models of the Leaf, which is now the standard to which other makers must compare. Buyers of the car qualify for a $7,500 Federal income-tax credit, a $2,500 purchase rebate in California, and a long list of other state, regional, and corporate incentives--including single-occupant use of the carpool lane on California freeways. Putting the Focus Electric in perspective, it's a very low-volume entry that is available only in limited regions. It can be viewed either as a cautious experiment in which Ford dips its toe into the electric-car market or solely  a ""compliance car"" that enables the company to meet its requirement for sales of zero-emission vehicles in the state of California. It's a perfectly competent electric car that has seen no quality issues, and owners are generally satisfied with their electric Fords. But the company puts far more marketing effort behind its C-Max and Fusion Hybrid models, both of which also offer Energi plug-in hybrid versions as well. Ford appears to believe that plug-in cars will be much more popular if they have gasoline engines as well.

Let us know.. Don’t foreclose Petroleum Products Subsidy discourse (2). By Sonny Atumah 
 
As we continue our discourse on subsidy from last week, let us examine the international geopolitics of subsidies. The greatest subsidisers of energy are the greatest consumers; the United States and China. They both spend about $3 trillion annually on subsidies for their people. 
 
Global geopolitics of subsidy is now baited for international climate negotiations. Western nations now encourage us to abandon subsidies because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases they emit that are linked to climate change. The discourse now is the reduction of fossil fuel which for a long time had been the world’s largest source of electricity for renewable energy. 
 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that by 2030, renewable energy could become the world’s largest source of electricity ahead of known conventional sources of coal, natural gas and nuclear power. Arguments are that energy source would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions which would soon peak with dangerous consequences. 
 
The Conference of the Parties to the UN global treaty on climate change slated for December 2015 in Paris would give countries the opportunity to submit their Individual Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). The US plans to cut greenhouse emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 levels by 2030 while the EU plans to cut by 40 percent of its1990 levels. China plans to start bringing down its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. 
 
They advise us to jettison subsidies using economic theorems that are provable from axioms; that money saved from subsidy removal could be channelled into infrastructure as education and health for the good of the people. Call it logic; subsidy is also for the good of the people. 
 
Their new technologies developed result in new products and energy sources including renewable energy that are rendering liquid fossil fuel useless. OPEC members’ (including Nigeria) survivals are being threatened. The whole essence is that our liquid fossil fuel would soon become a commodity like coal which for centuries was a priceless resource for energy would become a worthless energy resource at the end of the 21st century. 
 
What has now become shale revolution has dealt a big blow on countries like Nigeria as a crude oil exporting nation. This new technology is a result of the 40-year old research of America in response to the Arab Oil embargo on America and its allies in the Arab – Israeli War of 1973. The United States is now taking full control the oil market supply and price, and with their strong currency for now we are out for a raw deal. 
 
The same countries that discourage fossil fuel subsidies offer consumer subsidies to purchasers of hybrid and electric cars. Automobile companies like GM, Ford and Chrysler in the United States have been encouraged through subsidies to produce and sell E85 (Flexible fuel) vehicles that run on gasoline (85 percent) and ethanol (15 percent) blends. 
 
Nearly 10 million flex fuel vehicles sold in the United States have government tax credit as subsidy for producers and users. Corn farmers in the Mid-west states are being encouraged to produce more for the ethanol content of Flex fuel\/E85. Americans get up to $7500 credit for driving electric vehicles. In Canada, subsidy for the use of Electric vehicles attract 8600 dollars subsidy. In Europe, the need to reduce the use of liquid fossil fuels has made the various governments especially the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members to subsidise the use of Plug in electric vehicles. In the UK Drivers are to get 5000 pounds electric car subsidy from government if they buy electric cars. 
 
In France subsidy for use of electric vehicles is up to 2000 euros and free parking; Germany-exemption from annual circulation tax for five years; Italy-75 percent reduction of tax rate; Spain-6000 euros tax incentive; Netherland-exemption from registration fee and road taxes amounting to 5324 euros over four years. In China, for use of Plug in electric vehicle, there is exemption from taxes up to 7634 dollars while in Japan, it is between 2000 and 9000 dollars 
 
Former British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair recently asked President Buhari to remove subsidy on petroleum products in Nigeria. The former British leader knows how the less privileged are adequately protected with all sorts of subsidies including council flats housing, mortgages, immigration laws to reduce the level of unemployment for British citizens. The United States is spending $148 billion in 2015 in subsidizing agriculture. Here in Nigerian there is no public good; security, electricity, water, mosquito spraying programme, agriculture, pollution control, transportation, adequate health care, education and other public infrastructure are almost nonexistent. 
 
In Nigeria the revenue from crude which has come down as a result of the global oil glut has forced the country to devalue the Naira in quick succession. This no doubt is affecting the cost of importing refined petroleum products. With the government paying the difference in the cost of landing and the pump price which we call subsidy, it will continue to be a problem. Let us refine locally! 
 
One is advising the Kachikwu-led NNPC not to stop import subsidy for now as it will pose a serious challenge to the Nigerian monetary authorities because of its inflationary tendencies in the short run. One believes that even with the fiscal authorities trying to rein in government spending occasioned by low revenues of crude exports, real fiscal retrenchment may only be realizable in the middle term. 
 
What led to forged subsidy claims are corruption and inefficiency in the system. That we spent six billion dollars in one year (2012) on subsidy is scratching the surface. We must find out how we spent, why we spent and to who we spent, when we have four refineries that were not allowed to operate in two decades. We should know what exactly the country imports, and consumes daily of various products. 
 
The President has promised to beam a searchlight on the NNPC to kill the monster. The germane issues that must be investigated killed and certified dead to allow the system work is how we got entangled in import subsidy. Have we invested in this racket that has left the perpetrators merely removed from office and given absolution to go with their loot and sin no more? Not for President Buhari.. Michigan’s Largest Fleet of Propane Autogas Buses to Drive Detroit Public Schools’ Students September 02, 2015District’s transport​ation company rolls out school buses powered by emission-​reducing,​ affordable alternative fuel with ROUSH.... The use of propane autogas school buses is a step in the right direction to significantly decrease vehicle emissions and improve the air quality for our students.  
 DETROIT (PRWEB)  September 03, 2015  

Beginning this school year, many Detroit Public Schools students will ride to and from school in cleaner-operating buses fueled by propane autogas. The 35 alternative-fueled Blue Bird Vision Propane buses will lower costs while improving the environment by reducing Detroit’s carbon footprint. 
 
This is the largest fleet of propane autogas school buses in the state of Michigan. 
 
“The use of propane autogas school buses is a step in the right direction to significantly decrease vehicle emissions and improve the air quality for our students. This also provides opportunities for students and the community to observe and learn first-hand about alternative transportation technologies,” said James Minnick, executive director of DPS Office of Student Transportation. “This environmentally friendly green initiative has also resulted in having a bus fleet that is 30 percent brand new.” 
 
ABC Student Transportation , Detroit Public Schools’ transportation provider, chose buses fueled by propane autogas because of the buses’ advanced technology, environmental benefits, and fuel and maintenance cost reductions, according to ABC Student Transportation president Charlie Grant. 
 
“The adoption of propane autogas buses shows ABC Student Transportation’s commitment to implement buses powered by a fuel that is cleaner for Detroit’s students and the community, lowers operating costs, and is domestically produced,” said Phil Horlock, president and CEO of Blue Bird . “This is a great example of how the city of Detroit is being innovative in everything they do.” 
 
The new Blue Bird buses are equipped with an efficient Ford 6.8L V10 engine powered by ROUSH CleanTech propane autogas fuel systems. Historically, propane autogas costs about 50 percent less than diesel per gallon and reduces maintenance costs due to its clean-operating properties. Currently, ABC pays 74 cents per gallon for propane autogas compared with around $3.00 per gallon for diesel. 
 
In addition to fuel cost savings, the 35 propane autogas bus fleet will emit 12,445 fewer pounds of nitrogen oxide and 111 less pounds of particulate matter each year compared with the diesel buses they are replacing. Propane autogas also reduces hydrocarbon emissions and virtually eliminates particulate matter, when compared with conventionally fueled school buses. 
 
To fuel the buses, ABC installed a station with a 12,000-gallon propane tank near its facility on Westwood Street. 
 
“Propane autogas powered school buses offer advanced fuel technology for school districts looking for more efficient operation while experiencing a positive return on investment,” said Todd Mouw, vice president of sales and marketing for ROUSH CleanTech. 
 
Propane autogas is the most commonly used alternative fuel in the nation and worldwide. Vehicles fueled by autogas comply with the same safety standards as their conventionally fueled counterparts. 
 
“Together with Blue Bird, Ford and ROUSH CleanTech, we are able to provide world class technology and comfort to our customers at Detroit Public Schools,” said Grant.

The phone alarm goes off at 8am, and by the time I've hit 'snooze' 14 times, the battery is down to 10pc, so I have to get up. As I stagger to the shower like a baby giraffe walking on ice, I curse whatever Netflix junk kept me up two hours later than I intended. After failing to floss - but lying to myself that I will, tomorrow morning, when I have more energy - it's time to eat. First, I open the press containing all the porridge, muesli and flaxseeds, but it all went off two years ago and I know this, so I have toast and eggs instead, comforted by the memory of those good intentions when I bought the healthy stuff. Often, I will have two eggs. I don't believe the claims that they are high in cholesterol, because that ruins breakfast. Marty Whelan on lyric is my choice of radio, as it's cheerful.

First, I open the press containing all the porridge, muesli and flaxseeds, but it all went off two years ago and I know this, so I have toast and eggs instead, comforted by the memory of those good intentions when I bought the healthy stuff. Often, I will have two eggs. I don't believe the claims that they are high in cholesterol, because that ruins breakfast. Marty Whelan on lyric is my choice of radio, as it's cheerful. I live in south County Dublin, where I moved a few years ago and set up a studio. This is a great place to live when your commute is a 10-minute walk, but I don't think it's safe, because people around here seem to be very fearful. It's beside the sea, so perhaps they live in dread of floods, because they drive huge trucks with fuel emissions that would embarrass a 1984 Ford Cortina. So afraid are they of taking their hand off the wheel, that they won't even salute you if you let them into your lane.

I work from home until lunchtime - it's too shameful to admit what I have for lunch; just look at my midriff in recent photos, and you'll have a good guess - then walk to the office. OK, sometimes I take the car, if it's raining. Or if there's rain forecast. Or someone has mentioned rain in the last seven days. The walk takes 10 minutes. Often, the drive can take 20 minutes, because life doesn't make any sense. I stay in the office and pretend to work for most of the afternoon, but really, I get everything important done in an hour, just like 90pc of the population.

When Callan's Kicks is on air, I have to read massive amounts of news online. I have a few subscriptions so I don't miss anything, but I will usually get distracted and start watching videos and reading content irrelevant to the week's show. Then the endless emails start, all that scrolling and updating and replying to the interminable onslaught that will only end when I die. Or if I run screaming into the forest, like Daniel Day-Lewis in The Last of the Mohicans, vowing to shed all technology. Although I'll probably emerge from the forest every now and then, to see if my vow to relinquish all belongings has gone viral.

I've a show touring in the autumn; it won't actually get written - just abandoned, when I run out of time - and lots of the gags will be improvised on the night. Don't tell anyone. They pay a lot to come in.

There is no formal structure to my working life. Callan's Kicks goes out on a Friday. A lot of the writing is done on Wednesday, then rewritten on Thursday and recorded up until midnight. Half of that often gets redone on Friday. I get distracted along the way watching YouTube videos and replying to emails. I work best when the deadline is looming. And I'm most productive at night, when the phone stops ringing and news stops breaking. As an ex-journo, it's the deadline looming that kicks me into action. I had no future in journalism though, I just couldn't hack phones.

As far as coming up with characters goes, either I spot someone, or it's suggested to me who I should do next. I start doing them badly, and then one word and notion just hits me and I have them. For example, when I'm doing Dobbo, I just sit and watch something and commentate as Dobbo, in an excessively cruel way. For example, I was cooking earlier, and RTE News was reporting stuff about Northern Ireland. So I went into Dobbo mode: 'Good Lord, not the North again. The only reason they all agreed to have peace was to keep Tommie Gorman off the news. They lasted just 10 years. Oh well, what can you expect from a region that names an airport after an alcoholic wife-beater?' In summary, I torture everyone with a new impression until they beg me to stop, to tone it down for taste, and, hey presto - a new Callan's Kicker is born.

The inspiration comes from anywhere, any time. My mind is like a ping-pong machine, and the ball hurtles about aimlessly until it hits something and pings. The 'Brian Cody interview' sketch that I had ready for the hurling final - I came up with that while I was cutting a hedge. The impressions and character building is largely done in my head, but the Callan's Kicks shows are written with a surprisingly large team, with a huge drinking capacity.

I would like to do lots of writing and less emailing, accounting, logistics and driving about like a storm-chaser. I have a few ideas whereby I hope to spend my entire future life reading lots, and writing even lotser.

For exercise, I now cycle to meetings. And my remote-control arm gets plenty of flexing. Oh, and the same arm opens wine, too. It's very active. I should drink with my left to balance it out, lest I develop Popeye-right-arm syndrome.

I mostly cook at home, but it usually tastes of disappointment. For treats, I go to La Reserve in Ranelagh, with friends, to discuss sketch ideas.

Before bed, I read things like John Connolly, which give me nightmares. Or watch things on Netflix, which also give me nightmares. I love nightmares. Mine are often directed by Stanley Kubrick. Before sleep, I picture dreadful, evil people and fantasise about taking them out with a sniper rifle or a silenced revolver. It relaxes me. It's like the Tarantino version of counting sheep. Am I happy? That's a ridiculous question. We all spend our lives worrying about the future, until we have none.

Outside perspectives and an escape from red tape make it a powerful tool.

Even if they’ve been longtime partners, the tech sector’s influence on the automotive industry has never been stronger. OEMs in Detroit, Stuttgart, Seoul, and elsewhere are continually transforming cars to meet the demands of consumers now conditioned to smartphones (and their 18-month refresh cycle). Much of this is being driven by cheap and rugged hardware that can finally cope with the harsh environment (compared to your pocket or an air-conditioned office) that a car needs to be able to handle. Wireless modems, sensors, processors, and displays are all essential to a new car in 2015, but don’t let this visible impact fool you. The tech industry is having a broader influence on the automobile. Hardware is important, but we're now starting to see larger tech philosophies adopted—like the open source car.

Those two words will instinctively conjure images of Richard Stallman for some, but fear not, there will be no parrots in this piece. Open source means more things than just free software, and, in the case of cars, we're talking about collaborative platforms and diverse communities combining to design vehicles (or things for vehicles) more quickly and efficiently than the status quo. Today this ethos is being adopted by more than just plucky outsider upstarts—or startups—shaking up the establishment with their tech industry ways. Yes, some of that is going on, but even global giants like Ford have some skin in the open source game.

StreetScooter Recently, the consumer tech product cycle has been driven by the relentless metronome that is Moore's law. Near-annually, we expect lighter, more powerful, and cheaper phones and computers to deploy in our pockets, on our laps, and increasingly in our cars. It's been moving at this pace long enough now for this progress to seem normal, but even halving the development time of a new car must seem like a challenge to the automotive industry, considering it plays by a very different set of rules.

For one thing, a car is an incredibly complex product to design. It must be able to cope with temperature extremes from a Minnesotan winter to a Nevadan summer, operate for years with minimal maintenance, and still meet government safety standards and efficiency regulations. And the consequences of bad design are more than just product recalls or even massive lawsuits—people trust their vehicles with their lives daily.

Still, we’re not here to lionize the old way of car design. Large bureaucracies—particularly ones that have been around a generation or two—become siloed, hidebound, sclerotic. And if one keeps asking the same group of engineers and designers the same questions, it should not be surprising if one continues to get the same conventional answers. Opening up the design process beyond small homogenous groups inside automotive OEMs to include suppliers and even customers can have a big effect, as the German company StreetScooter demonstrates.

StreetScooter has its roots in the University of Aachen, a few miles from the point where Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium all meet. At first, its aim was to see if a collaborative approach could design a short-range electric vehicle (EV) that was both affordable and sustainable for less than the norm. ""The idea was to develop a car in the context of a modular product architecture where you integrate partners at eye level,"" said Markus Hannen, technical director for automotive at software firm PTC (one of the collaborators on the StreetScooter initiative). ""So you can use the full innovation potential of a supplier. You as an OEM don't have to write the spec and they don't have to respond to it, you work together.""

Traditionally, an automotive design team will sit down and work out which bits of a car will be designed in-house, what gets outsourced, and what the specs are for those systems or components. Then they publish their requirements for suppliers to bid on. It's not hard to see why this typically takes a while. Coming up with a spec, getting all the requisite bosses' signatures, waiting for suppliers to react, then going through the process to find the most acceptable bid sure adds a lot of steps and paperwork that don't really contribute to the design itself.

So StreetScooter opted for a different path, using what the firm calls a ""Disruptive Network Approach"" to skip all the steps after ""coming up with a spec"" by having vehicle designers and engineers work directly with suppliers from the beginning. Under this process, a network of 80 partners took less than a year to go from a clean sheet to a functional prototype of a short-range EV that they debuted at the 2011 Frankfurt auto show.

Deutsche Post (better known to Americans as DHL) was among those who took notice. Hannen told us that DHL wanted to know if customers could be integrated into designing a product as well. As a delivery service, Deutsche Post has specific needs, and using cars from existing OEMs traditionally meant choosing from products already out there as opposed to tailor-made solutions.

As you’d imagine, the demands of a mail delivery vehicle can be quite different from a normal consumer car; it only takes one look at one of the US Postal Service's Grumman LLVs for this to be quite plain. Work on a delivery derivative of the first StreetScooter prototype to something suitable for Deutsche Post took just six months. In fact, the German company was so pleased that it bought StreetScooter; the company is now building 20,000 of the EVs for its fleet.

Although Hannen is proud of the contribution that PTC's Creo design software made to the program, he's quick to point out that it's not a closed shop; this collaboration platform supports heterogeneous environments. ""In the same way that you don't hand down a central spec which people design to, the idea is not to be prescriptive with the tools people use to create those designs,"" he said.

Local Motors

Local Motors is probably the name most commonly associated with open source automobiles. Its approach is closer to the archetype of open source design, leveraging the power of enthusiast communities working in their spare time. The company was founded in 2007 by Jay Rogers, who ""wanted to see if the power of the crowd could be applied to larger hardware development,"" as company CFO Jean-Paul Capin told us. ""We started building a Web app. Very few people believed it was possible at first. The idea was to reduce R&D costs and have a better vehicle at the end, because the people doing the collaborating during the design process—a mix of engineers, designers, hobbyists, and even consumers—would have a say from the beginning. It was different to the traditional process where engineers and designers don't always work together, then they bring a product to market and involve customers through focus groups and so on.""

The company has had particular success with setting up challenges for its community to respond to. ""We ran 20 different challenges,"" Capin said. ""Local Motors is about local manufacturing, so we had 20 different cities we wanted to design cars for. We started collaborating with the community with those 20 designs, then announced that whichever design won the community vote, we'd move production there. The rally car won, so we moved to Phoenix and headquartered there, leveraged local supply chains and local knowledge, and that's how the Rally Fighter was born.""

As with StreetScooter, Local Motors' success has been in finding automotive niches and developing cars to fit. The Rally Fighter, the company's first car, surely fits this description: it’s a street-legal, off-road racing car that would even cause Mad Max's eye to stray from the last of the V8 interceptors. The company’s latest project should have broader appeal, however, as it’s much more adventurous: a road-ready 3D printed car.

Local Motors wants to disrupt more than just car design; it also wants to change the way they're built (and eventually, sold). In 2013 the company partnered with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, working with its manufacturing demonstration facilities. ""Even now, we're still making the Rally Fighter the same way cars have been made for the last 100 years,"" Capin said. ""Steel tube frame chassis, rolling chassis construction. We weren't really revolutionizing things there, but knew we could do better. Now we're working to bring large-scale additive manufacturing to vehicles.""

The first step was the LITECAR challenge, which Local Motors ran for ARPA-E (part of the Department of Energy). The result of that was the Strati, a prototype 3D-printed EV. Project [Redacted] followed with a winner announced a few weeks ago. Printing a car's body out of carbon fiber reinforced plastic is so different from the existing way we build cars that we wondered whether Local Motors encountered any trouble with federal or state regulators. ""A 3D printed car is going to be interesting,"" Capin said. ""It's not only an open source design, but it's a completely new way of manufacturing. The properties of the materials, the crash test structures—these are all the things we're working on right now. We're working with thermoplastic suppliers like Sabic, Oak Ridge, and others to help us understand how the materials behave: crashes, wear and tear, and so on. We have to show it's just as safe, or safer, than any other car.”

Given the novelty of what Local Motors is attempting, we were curious about precisely who was designing these cars. According to Capin, the company’s open source community is about 50,000 strong. ""The Rally Fighter had thousands of people actively collaborating,” he said. “We have a rule: for every active member we have 10 who are active but not leading a design, and then another 100 who would review or comment on a design.” Local Motors’ community comes from over 120 different countries. It includes industrial designers working for OEM or Tier 1 suppliers doing it in their spare time to enthusiasts ""who have nothing to do with engineering or design but who love cars and want to do this as a hobby,"" Capin told us.

As for credit, people's effort is quantified by backend analytics in the collaboration platform, and royalty payments are set aside for community members who participate on products that go to market. In the vein of open source, however, Capin said that it was important to the company that none of the community members live off their contribution to Local Motors.

Ford's experience with open source design comes from a different starting point than either an academic experiment (StreetScooter) or a disruptive startup (Local Motors). It's one of the biggest and certainly one of the oldest of the OEMs, but it's been looking at using the power of the cloud for quite a while now. K. Venkatesh Prasad is central to that effort. Prasad—who has an eclectic background for the auto industry, coming to Ford from CalTech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory by way of Silicon Valley—told us that initiative stems from a desire for collaboration. ""We were looking at how hard it was to get data out of cars that the creative folks on the outside [of Ford] wanted,” he said. “[We started] exposing information that would be exposed anyway (i.e. vehicle speed or steering wheel angle) on a read-only basis.""

The result is a software and hardware platform called OpenXC. The hardware is an OBD2 dongle that connects to the car with a software platform that makes it easy for users to work with the data coming from the CAN. ""Our guiding principle is open source hardware and software, read-only so that things that are regulated, (safety, emissions) aren't tampered with,"" he said. (This was a rather timely conversation to have, as it happened the same day news broke of the UConnect hack.)



Ford

""It turns out most people are pretty good at abiding by those guidelines,"" Prasad said. ""Between those bookends there's a lot of things that people can do, and most of those people are pretty good at abiding by those guidelines. They want to do the right thing. For every one person with an evil intent, you generate 10 to 15 ambassadors who really want to do the right thing, so you get a lot of good work out of the process.""

Prasad’s colleague, Randy Visintainer (whom we last met at Ford's autonomous driving lab), added that it was an innovation workshop with Eric von Hippel that opened his eyes to the potential of open source for Ford. ""All the innovation we were doing was still close-knit around a known community [Ford's staff and their suppliers] and the power of the crowd was completely missing,” he said. “We wanted to find a way to open up some of the vehicle and leverage the crowd. Out of all of those discussions and experiments came the idea of doing OpenXC. It was intended to be an open platform, started as open source software, then expanded to hardware, which was eye-opening.""

OpenXC hasn't yet been used to develop a whole car, but that isn't its point. Instead, the platform has led to products—like Zac Nelson's haptic gear knob for example. Nelson was a young engineer at Ford, and he wanted to add haptic feedback to his Mustang's shifter. ""He needed to rightsize the electronics, including cannibalizing an Xbox controller, then 3D printed a new knob,"" Prasad told us. Although the build itself was impressive, what separated this from a science fair presentation was that ""he documented the entire process, what kind of materials he used, the 3D printer files, the CADCAM files, the electronics sourcing, the bill of materials, and a reference implementation,"" Prasad said. ""His story was very interesting to us, we made a video, and it's got a lot of interest.""

Is Open Source Design a panacea?

In spite of the success stories above, open source design faces challenges in the automotive community just like it does in the tech world. ""The challenges are always to integrate all the information coming from different sources,"" PTC's Hannen said. ""If you want to use the full innovation potential, and you don't want to restrict how people innovate and what tools they use to do so, it's always a challenge integrating that information. As a software vendor we've developed the modular product architecture with clearly described interfaces, which are packaged with the right information surrounding them. So you can develop particular components with all the information you need."" (Prasad also stressed the need for good UI design.)

Intellectual Property also reared its head, as it often does when discussing innovation. ""The highest concern is always security,"" Hannen told us. ""You need a secure or trusted ecosystem. There's some information you'd want everyone to be able to see, but individual suppliers will have IP concerns and other information will have to be protected or controlled."" At Local Motors, IP is held under a creative commons license. ""We protect some things like the trade dress and the names, but aside from that we don't file for patents and IP, it's more about speed to market,"" Capin said. Similarly, Ford will patent new IP created on OpenXC, but the intent isn't to restrict innovation. ""You can't give something away if you don't own it. This lets us take the IP we have and get some use out of it,"" Prasad said.

But largely these challenges are outweighed by the benefits, perhaps best summed up by Local Motors' Capin: ""Speed to market, because you can put so many more people to a project with a lot of energy and passion and diverse ideas that you wouldn't get from more homogenous teams.""

We heard similar open source praise from Prasad. ""It builds added value to the core platform. It brings value in to the company, but also places value outside,” he said. “Otherwise we could just do it the standard way, publishing a request for products and getting suppliers to tender. As a firm, we can look at the conversations that the community are having, and if it's an interesting idea we want to pursue we can license things.""

To date, OpenXC has been adopted for a lot of projects at Ford with a lot of engineering efficiency. Prasad and Visintainer point to the company's work on active grill shutters as an example. (These are flaps that close or open behind a vehicle's grill, altering airflow into the car and changing its aerodynamic efficiency.) ""It used to take a long time to wire those things to be tested, now it's much easier for engineers to just use OpenXC,"" Prasad said. It starts with ""a lead user doing something because it makes their job easier, not to make money, but indirectly it's an efficiency, so it begins to help the engineering organization.""

These various automotive open source advocates come at the topic from different backgrounds and with different approaches, but they can all recognize we’ve entered an era for open source cars that simply didn’t exist before. PTC's Hannen pointed to Google's new involvement in the car industry, as well as the rumors that abound about Apple's auto plans as prominent examples that wouldn’t have existed 10 or even five years ago.

""Traditional industry didn't see it as a valid option for developing a car at first,” Hannen said. “Now the idea has a lot more respect.""

Oil & Gas Editor The following is a statement attributed to Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Producers & Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO), regarding the report released recently by Environment Texas and Frontier Group: 
 
Longanecker said, “The latest installment from anti-oil and gas organizations immediately loses credibility by yet again making false claims about hydraulic fracturing, the majority of which have already been refuted by the scientific community and governmental agencies at the state and federal level. Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized domestic oil and gas production, and continues to be performed in a safe and responsible manner by operators not only in West Texas, but across the state and throughout the nation. 
 
“Despite inaccuracies and false assumptions that may be spread by activist organizations, we are reminded by the fact that to date, there remains no confirmed case of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. The definitive connections made throughout the report are both reckless and desperate, but not surprising given the history of these organizations and their anti-oil and gas rhetoric. When an organization’s mission is to stop the development of hydrocarbons in our country, that mission has a tendency to skew the truth and create biased, often inaccurate, reporting to justify its existence and advance its cause. 
 
Pumpjacks at a Murphy Oil Corporation (MUR - NYQ) well pad site just North of Campbellton on U.S. Hwy. 281 A. Murphy Oil is an active producer south of Pleasanton. Murphy Oil has leases in eight Eagle Ford counties - Atascosa, Bee, Dimmit, Karnes, La Salle, McMullen, Webb and Wilson Counties. LEON ZABAVA | PLEASANTON EXPRESS “Additionally, the report also makes no reference to the profound advancements in fluid technology and proactive efforts taken by industry and state regulatory agencies to reduce the amount of freshwater used in exploration and production methods. While freshwater is ideal in many cases, it’s important to remember that some wells and operators use no fresh water whatsoever in the hydraulic fracturing process, but instead utilize brackish water, recycled water, a combination, or one of many new methods being developed. Environmental stewardship has given rise to many advancements in fluid innovation and the U.S. oil and gas industry continues to lead in the adoption of these new technologies. Water use will continue to be a key area focus for reducing cost, improving extraction methods, and minimizing the use of this important natural resource. 
 
“Moreover, study after study continue to confirm methane emissions are down by the oil and gas industry, even with rising drilling activity. Case in point, after comprehensive study, researchers at the University of Texas found that air emissions from natural gas production — including hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking” — are lower than previously thought.” 
 
Longanecker continued, “With increasing levels of oil and gas production in recent years, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC), Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and state legislature have enacted a variety of new policies to protect Texas citizens, while supporting responsible drilling and production activities in the state. These include Statewide Rule 13, which created the most stringent wellbore integrity guidelines in the country for the protection of groundwater, water recycling rules that have helped to spur innovation and increased adoption, and more than $2 billion in funding allocated in recent years to the Texas State Water Plan, all of which came from oil and natural gas severance taxes in the Texas Rainy Day Fund. 
 
The Texas Railroad Commission also recently finalized new requirements for operators related to disposal wells in areas of historical or future seismic activity to address concerns of citizens and municipalities. Additionally, this session several legislators successfully advanced appropriations for seismic research through House Bill 2, which included an additional $4.5 million out of the General Revenue Fund for the purchase and deployment of seismic equipment, including 22 monitors, the maintenance of seismic networks, modeling of reservoir behavior for systems of wells in the vicinity of faults, and the establishment of a technical advisory committee. We believe continued collaboration and research related to seismicity, earthquake mitigation, risk assessment, and related regulations is an important process, and we are committed to continuing our participation to identify the true cause of seismic activity in our state. 
 
“Beyond the strong levels of regulatory oversight maintained by the government, hydraulic fracturing and associated production provide important sources of economic support. As stated by Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush just last month, “When private oil and gas companies develop minerals managed by the GLO, it creates high-paying jobs and earns hundreds of millions of dollars a year for public education in Texas.” In fact, over the past couple years, the UT system has earned record levels of revenue from mineral leases, amounting to more than $1 billion in value, thanks to development of shale formations by use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques.” 
 
The Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) is a trade association representing the interests of 3,000 independent oil and natural gas producers and royalty owners throughout Texas.

Oberon Fuels Partners With Ford & FVV on 3-Year, 3.5 Million Euro Project to Build and Test World's First Production Passenger Car Powered by DME. SAN DIEGO, CA and AACHEN, GERMANY and FRANKFURT, GERMANY -- (Marketwired) -- 09\/15\/15 --  Oberon Fuels, Inc. (""Oberon""), the first company to produce fuel-grade dimethyl ether (""DME"") in North America, is partnering with Ford Motor Company, Forschungsvereinigung Verbrennungskraftmaschinen e. V. (FVV), and other FVV member companies on a 3-year, EUR 3.5 million project to research, analyze and test the potential of DME and oligomethyl ether (OME) fuel in passenger cars and heavy-duty truck engines, and ultimately build the world's first production passenger car powered by DME for on-road testing. 

FVV is a unique worldwide research network of 170 international member companies across the engine supply chain, including researchers, engine manufacturers, component suppliers, and fuel providers. FVV has become the leading forum for pre-competitive joint research projects, for the exchange of knowledge between industry and science, and for training junior researchers for work in the industry. 
     
""We must continue to find ways to meet the growing global demand for liquid transportation fuels with lower-carbon fuels and more efficient, cleaner burning engines if we are to ensure the long term sustainability of our planet,"" said Ralf Thee, project manager with FVV. ""This is our most ambitious project yet, and we are pleased to be working with partners who share our commitment to innovation."" 

DME is a clean-burning, non-toxic fuel that can be derived from renewable sources. Its high cetane number and quiet combustion, as well as its inexpensive propane-like fueling system, make it an excellent diesel alternative for both passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles. DME-powered engines are expected to benefit from almost soot-free combustion, higher thermal efficiency and excellent cold start properties. 

""Ford is committed to helping develop the market for alternative fuels, and DME has exciting characteristics,"" said Werner Willems, Ph.D., a technical specialist for powertrain combustion systems with Ford of Europe, and project leader for this initiative. ""Not only does DME offer the efficiency and torque desired in a diesel engine, but it can be made from renewable waste streams and reduce the long-term cost of ownership, all of which are important to our customers."" 

The project will investigate the use of DME and OME as diesel replacements in passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicle engines, respectively, and will result in the first OEM-produced DME passenger car in the world. Technical preparations and combustion engine development will span the first two years of the project with the third year focused on building demonstrator cars based on the Ford Mondeo. 

Oberon Fuels will supply DME for the project from its small-scale pilot plant in Brawley, California, which has a nameplate capacity of 4,500 gallons (~17,000 liters) of DME per day. 

In this international collaboration, Oberon will work with Ford, RWTH Aachen University, the Technical University of Munich, FVV, TUEV, DENSO, and IAV Automotive Engineering. Through the FVV, the leading forum for joint research projects on engine technology, all automotive manufacturers will gain access to the results and findings of the project, further building the market for DME as a diesel alternative. This project is partly funded by the German Ministry of Economy (BMWi). 

""By bringing together numerous stakeholders up and down the supply chain, we will be able to accelerate the process of bringing a new, sustainable fuel to a wide range of vehicles,"" said Rebecca Boudreaux, Ph.D., president of Oberon Fuels. ""By converting waste streams into clean-burning DME fuel, we can address global emissions as well as create new economic opportunities through more distributed fuel production and consumption. FVV's and Ford's leadership in this project are recognized and appreciated by all."" 

DME fuel has made significant progress in the United States and around the world, with approvals and certifications from several regulatory bodies, including the US Environmental Protection Agency, ASTM International, ISO, and, most recently, the State of California. 

About Oberon Fuels 
California-based Oberon Fuels monetizes biogas and industrial waste streams by converting such feedstock into higher valued commodities. Using its proprietary small-scale process, Oberon makes DME, a clean-burning diesel alternative, and methanol from methane and carbon dioxide. In 2013, Oberon Fuels' pilot plant in Brawley, California produced the first fuel-grade DME in North America, which is currently being used by Volvo Trucks, a division of The Volvo Group, in its commercial demonstrations of DME-powered, heavy-duty trucks.

SOURCE  Hyundai Motor America. First drive Hyundai Tucson 2016. Hyundai has traditionally been seen as the budget option, a brand that offers solid if unremarkable cars for those less willing to splash the cash. 

That changed with the launch of the ix35, the small SUV marking a change in ambitions for the Korean firm. It wanted to be seen as a design-led option, although still maintaining their value origins. 

Now the new Tucson is aiming even higher, targeting the Nissan Qashqai - the undisputed champion of the mid-size crossover market.

To differentiate the Tucson, it’s been beefed up visually. There’s an oversized front grille, plastic cladding around the wheel arches (it’s also asymmetric, to give the illusion of movement even when it’s stationary) and bold swage lines down the side of the car. 

However, it’s not tough to drive. With 1.7-litre diesel in our test car, there’s just 207 lb-ft of torque available, although it’s mated to an unusually slick six-speed gearbox that makes the task of moving quickly easier than you fear. The 0-62 sprint is topped off in 13.7 seconds, but a wide torque band and that lovely gearbox makes it feel a lot livelier out on the road. 

It won’t ever be described as quick, but the payoff for that is impressive economy. Officially, the Tucson should return 61.7mpg. While that’s an almost impossible figure to achieve, we never saw the average economy drop below 40mpg, and that was on terrain as varied as fast motorways and taken-too-fast forest tracks. 

The variety showed off the handling nicely. It’s not particularly engaging, and there is almost zero feel through the steering wheel, but once the initial lean in corners has settled down, you’ll find the Hyundai to be a neutrally balanced car that grips far harder than it ought to. 

Sacrificing outright handling prowess reaps benefits elsewhere; the ride quality is pretty good in all but the harshest of environments. That may be down to 17-inch wheels with relatively tall rubber that absorbs a lot of the smaller bumps before the suspension does its job, but however it’s done, it’s done well. 

That leaves you to enjoy the space in the cabin without interruption. It’s a big interior, able to seat five adults without any issues at all, while a large boot behind is cavernous enough to carry a few sets of golf clubs or a couple of child buggies. There are countless storage compartments dotted around the cabin too, so it makes for a fine family option. 

Unusually, a full-size spare wheel comes as standard, which comes in handy on those forest tracks... 



The only serious let down in the quality of the plastics used around the cabin. While it’s all bolted together well and feels as tough as anything else, the plastics are disappointingly hard and scratchy, even high up in the cockpit and around touch points. 

With some models costing well over £30,000, that’s a frustration, especially given how the exterior exudes kerb appeal. 

Despite that, the rest of the Tucson is solid enough. While you can go mad with larger engines and higher spec levels, as well as four-wheel drive, the front-wheel drive SE Nav spec we drove offered an excellent balance between price, equipment, and economy, while a set of winter tyres will get you most places the four-wheel drive models would. 

Top that off with a five year unlimited mileage warranty, and the Tucson makes a very strong case. 

Leasing rates for the new Tucson currently start at £139.99 \/ £167.98, averaging at £303 \/ 357 (business \/ personal).

Volvo not attending: strategy is Detroit, Geneva, Shanghai & Beijing shows only. Sweden’s largest h2 fuelling station opened. Sweden’s largest, and Stockholm’s first, hydrogen fuelling station for fuel-cell cars has been opened in Arlanda by Linde’s Swedish subsidiary AGA. 

“Hydrogen in connection with fuel-cell technology now has a solid track record,” says Bo Dyrvold, responsible for Linde’s gases business in Northern Europe. “This hydrogen fuelling station in connection with Hyundai’s and Toyota’s fuel-cell cars offers the possibility to drive completely emission-free. It is very positive for us to be contributing to taking yet another step towards a more sustainable society.” 
 
The new hydrogen fuelling station in the vicinity of Stockholm’s airport has a capacity of 180 fillings with a pressure of 700-bar per day. It takes only three minutes to fill the car up and the range is approximately 500 kilometres on a full hydrogen tank. 
 
“The Linde Group, which AGA is a part of, is a world leader in hydrogen technology. Having set up approximately 100 hydrogen fuelling stations in 15 countries and having successfully completed over one million refuelling operations, Linde is leading the way in hydrogen infrastructure development,” the company said in a statement. 
 
Fuel-cell cars run on hydrogen converted to electricity and emit only water vapour. The hydrogen comes from AGA’s facility in Sandviken, where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen with green electricity in an electrolyser. 
 
The hydrogen fuelling station is supported by the EU via the HIT-2 project (Hydrogen Infrastructure for Transport).. Asia stocks lackluster as Japan falls, Fed speech awaited. FILE - In this Monday, July 6, 2015 file photo,…

ROHSTOFF INTERNATIONAL0:03 | 16.09.2015 Hyundai Headed to U.S. District Court To Face Charges of Patent Infringement
Hyundai, the South Korean automaker that has emphasized its desire to
develop more eco-friendly vehicles, is headed to U.S. District Court in
Baltimore next week to face charges that its hybrid vehicles are
infringing on patented technology developed by Paice LLC. Paice, a small technology company responsible for inventing the method
of control for highly effective, fuel efficient hybrid electric
vehicles, filed the patent infringement lawsuit against Hyundai and Kia
in February 2012 after unsuccessfully trying to negotiate a licensing
agreement. The complaint claims that the South Korean automakers are
selling hybrid vehicles, including the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and Kia
Optima Hybrid, that infringe on patented technology developed by Paice. “It’s important for us to protect the valuable hybrid technology that
Paice invented,” said Robert Oswald, chief executive officer of Paice
and a 50-year veteran of the automotive industry. “I regret that we were
forced to take this case to court. We would prefer to license our
technology to automakers like Hyundai, but we will do whatever is
necessary to vigorously defend our inventions.”
About Paice
Paice has been at the forefront of hybrid technology for more than 20
years. Led by an innovative and experienced team of automotive veterans,
Paice made its mark by discovering new ways to maximize fuel efficiency
and reduce harmful emissions without sacrificing driving performance. The company was founded in 1991 by Dr.
Alex Severinsky. By developing hybrid technology before major
automakers began to focus on the potential advantages associated with
electrification of the powertrain, Paice’s technology laid the
foundation for today’s hybrid vehicles. Today, the company has 29 U.S. and foreign patents related to hybrid
vehicle technology.

NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Sanctions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may be just the beginning of Volkswagen AG 's Recent criminal prosecutions of General Motors On Friday, the Obama administration accused VW of deceiving EPA regulators about the level of toxic emissions in nearly half a million diesel VWs and Audis sold in the U.S. since 2008. The automaker, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, evidently rigged software on emissions controls to operate the engine in one way during tests and differently when driven by owners. 

A VW spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, said Saturday that the automaker is cooperating with the investigation. 

""Given the nature of what VW is being accused of I would expect that criminal charges are almost certainly forthcoming. If true, there is no way this can be passed off as a procedural mistake as was the case with the fuel economy problems at Hyundai and Ford. This appears to be very deliberate if true,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, a senior analyst with Navigant. 

Last year, Ford Motor The U.S. will order a recall of the affected vehicles, which may receive new software that improves emissions while reducing power and fuel economy. Under EPA rules, VW could be subject to as much as $18 billion in fines -- a stunning sum that, if levied, could stagger the automaker financially in the short term. 

On Friday, VW shares and on news of the EPA charges. 

For VW, whose announced goal is to surpass Toyota as the world's No. 1 automaker, the dust-up with the EPA is the latest in a series of setbacks. In April, a published comment about Martin Winterkorn, chief executive officer, by then chairman Ferdinand Piech in a German magazine ignited a shakeup in senior management and Piech's exit from VW's supervisory board. Piech remains a major VW shareholder. 

Last year, VW workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee narrowly voted down representation by the United Auto Workers union. The election created an uproar among politicians and business groups in the state, who suspected VW might be pushing unionization to mollify pro-union advocates in Germany.. Deal of the Day: Smart ForFour. Nigel Donnelly, Digital editor

Sep 19, 2015

The Smart ForFour might not be to everyone’s taste, but for those who love it for its quirky styling and supreme parking ability there are some exceptional deals available.

The car Smart ForFour 1.0 70 Passion 

The list price £12,115

The saving £3622

The discounted price £8,493 

The broker www.drivethedeal.com

Unusually, today's deal is for a pre-registered car, rather than a completely new one. You will be the second owner, even though most have only done a handful of miles. They are typically registered to clear the decks ahead of the new registration mark being issued. All cars are '15' plate models. The reason we include it is because it is an exceptional deal which sidesteps one of the downsides of the Smart - the high list price.

The deal is dependent on you taking the finance package which requires a £99 deposit and payments of £99 per month for three years.

For

The entry-level ForFour is our pick of the range. The full asking price is a bit steep but this deal makes the ForFour very easy to recommend.

It’s compact, easy to drive and extremely manoeuvrable. The ForFour is a doddle to park in town and comes with an efficient small petrol engine that's exempt from tax, thanks to its low CO2 emissions. The interior feels a cut above many city car rivals too.

Against

There are a number of good city cars on the market now, and other rivals of the ForFour – such as the Hyundai i10 and Volkswagen Up – are better to drive.

The 1.0-litre engine may be economical, but its performance won't set your heart alight. If you tend to drive in town however, you won't be worried.

As previously mentioned, the cars are pre-registered and are all black with white trim.

Should I add any options?

This is a pre-registered car deal, so options are not offered. That said, you can go for a metallic red one for an extra £5 per month.

What next?

Exterior 

The Mahindra TUV300’s design is claimed to be inspired by a “battle tank” with features like raised shoulders, high front nose, flat roof, straight bonnet and high ground clearance. The compact SUV sits on a new ladder frame chassis that makes it more compact and lighter than the Bolero. It’s the same platform that underpins the new Scorpio. On the front end, the car features bold grille with chrome inserts, static bending headlamps, black bumper, flat bonnet and rectangular fog lamps. 

Though the side profile looks plain and boxy, in fact the vehicle’s tyres too look undersized due to square-shaped wheel arches. That said, the prominent character line, roof rails and blackened C-Pillar help the vehicle’s side profile look sporty. The vehicle’s rear profile too looks simple but has a neat design that gives it a no-nonsense appeal. With aggressive stances and rear-mounted spare wheel, it looks like a proper SUV character despite being it the sub-4 metre vehicle. Other features include body-coloured door handles and wind mirrors, outside rear-view mirrors (ORVMs) and vertical tail-lamps. 

Mahindra TUV300 Color Options – Verve Blue, Glacier White, Dynamo Red, Majestic Silver, Bold Black and Molten Orange. 

Interior 

Inside, the car gets a dual-tone black and beige interior theme, hexapod centre console with piano black finish, and 7-seats (5 +2) configuration with two single jumper seats behind the second row. It offers best-in-class headroom and legroom. The chrome bezel surrounded instrument panel features a multi information display (MID) in the middle, a speedometer on right and a tachometer on the left. It gets two large dials with chrome highlights that add more to its sporty appeal. 

The three-spoke steering wheel has audio system controls, Bluetooth telephony and contoured palm grips. The power window switches and parking brake lever are positioned towards the rear end of the center console. It offers best-in-class expandable luggage space from 384-litre to 720-litre. Mahindra claims that TUV300 is ready ahead of time to meet the upcoming safety regulation – October, 2017. 

Mahindra TUV300 Variant-Wise Features 

TUV300 T4 – HVAC, power steering, power windows, tiltable steering, digital immobilizer and ECO mode, with optional ABS ad dual airbags. 

TUV300 T6 – ABS (anti-lock braking system), keyless entry, voice messaging system, 2-DIN audio with Bluetooth, body-coloured bumpers and handles, side and rear footsteps and stylish ski racks, with optional dual airbags and AMT. 

TUV300 T8 – Dual airbags, alloy wheels, static bending headlamps, electric ORVMs, Micro-hybrid technology, steering-mounted controls, driver seat height adjuster, lumber support, Intellipark reverse assist, fabric upholstery and optional AMT. 

Engine & Transmission 

Powering the Mahindra TUV300 is a mHawk architecture based engine – called mHawk80 – that makes it more powerful and efficient than the Bolero. This 1.5-litre mHawk80 turbocharged diesel engine delivers a maximum power of 84bhp and 230Nm of torque. This power-unit is boasted with the Micro hybrid technology which we have already seem on various Mahindra products including the Scorpio. 

The compact SUV also gets the start-stop option that helps save fuel and reduce emissions. This hybrid technology automatically switches off the engine when the vehicle comes to a halt, and gains life again once the clutch gets operational. 

The new Eco Mode system balances engine power for driving and AC usage. It also helps in achieving optimum fuel economy. Transmission options on offer are a 5-speed manual, and a 5-speed AMT (automated manual transmission). Mahindra claims that TUV300 returns a fuel efficiency of 18.49km\/l. This makes it one the most frugal cars in its league.

The TUV300 has the rear-wheel drive layout.. Hyundai Sonata Turbo 2015. Sonata is an impressive contender in the medium segment Expert Rating 74 \/ 100 Engine\/Drivetrain\/Chassis 14 Price, Packaging and Practicality 16 Safety & Technology 14 Behind the Wheel 16 X-Factor 14 0 20 Hyundai Sonata Turbo Premium

Road Test

With clear styling references to Hyundai's premium-segment Genesis model, the re-born Sonata brings good looks, great dynamics, family-style passenger and load space, plus plenty of standard gear to the mid-size car segment. Hyundai is confident enough to price the Sonata among high-profile contenders like the Mazda 6 and Ford's latest-generation Mondeo. Pricing starts from $29,990 (plus on-road costs).

When it was launched in January 2015, Hyundai's seventh-gen Sonata celebrated 26 years since its introduction to the Australian market. That's some history. When it first arrived the mid-size sedan was Australia's second offering from the fledgling Korean car-maker, following the Excel five-door in 1986.

The scepticism that surrounded the brand's introduction has all but been forgotten – especially with the company's recent tilt at the luxury car market with the Genesis large sedan. The rest of the range is equally impressive, earning respect from the motoring press and new-car buyers alike.

And that includes the new Sonata. Relaunched after a five-year hiatus – when the similarly-sized i40 took its place – the latest Sonata exemplifies the Hyundai of today.

The petrol-only Sonata range is now sold alongside the diesel-only i40 line-up, and is an appealingly styled, unapologetic contender in the mid-size segment. It is in lock-step with its rivals in all ways – and doesn't blanch at the idea of price-matching with European and Japanese rivals. It's not the most expensive in the segment, but it's not the cheapest either.

Checking the spec the Premium-badged flagship of the latest Sonata range, as tested here, is right in line with the likes of Ford's latest Mondeo Titanium and the Mazda Mazda6 Atenza – but is quite a bit more expensive than Toyota's premium non-hybrid Camry, the Atara SL [Ed: thanks to a recent price cut].

At the heart of the Premium-spec Sonata is an athletic, direct-injected 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo powerplant. It makes 180kW backed up by a meaty 350Nm, and winds out more punch than almost all of its nearest competitors (only the 177kW\/345Nm Mondeo comes close).

It's a turbo through and through with a rowdy growl on start-up, and husky note at work. Step-off acceleration tends to be a little abrupt, and on the run is not as smooth overall as some of its peers (i.e. Mazda6).

The upside is that the Sonata Turbo is very quick on the open road. It's never bothered about overtaking and, although the traction control steps in before everything goes haywire, is often quicker off the mark than intended.

The downside is that all that power comes at the cost of fuel economy. The Sonata Turbo quotes a less favourable consumption figure than Mondeo (8.5), Mazda6 (6.6) and Camry (7.8). It's quoted at 9.2L\/100km on the ADR Combined cycle, though our week of predominantly highway driving managed a Mondeo matching 8.5.

As a bonus, the Sonata Turbo runs on regular unleaded fuel (91 RON) and its 70-litre fuel tank is larger than the Toyota, Mazda or Ford. A shame, then, its tailpipe emissions fall so far behind (60g\/km more than the Mazda6 at 213g\/km).

Intensive Australian input to suspension tuning has brought dividends in terms of ride, handling and road grip. Prior to signing-off, the Sonata did some where various suspension combinations were tried. One car covered more than 100,000km in a process that resulted not just in many and varied spring and damper tunings but also modifications to the underbody, engine air intake and body sensors.

This shows up in a Sonata that is a decent drive. It has a nicely controlled body, confident turn-in via the well-weighted and relatively quick electrically assisted steering and good road grip on 235\/45-series tyres (on 18-inch alloys).

There's little shortage of gear in any Sonata variant, either. A reversing camera, auto bi-xenon headlights, rear parking sensors, keyless entry, and LED dash display are all standard. It also scores touch-screen sat-nav, dual-zone climate-control, heated and powered leather seats, electrochromatic rear-view mirrors (yes, all three), sunroof, rain-sensing wipers and pull-up sunshades on the rear windows.

The quality and attention to detail is evident throughout the cabin, even if the layout is a little conservative. It lacks the ambience of the Mazda6 and Mondeo, and I also think the seats border on 'firm and flat' (the tendency is to sit on, rather than in them). Some compensation for this is the excellent passenger space throughout, and the generous 510-litre boot – complete with full-size spare.

However, it's very important to consider that at this stage Sonata lacks the safety systems that are becoming regular fare in many medium models. Blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking (AEB), radar cruise control and lane-departure warning are absent from Sonata, as is idle-stop fuel saving technology.

The Sonata does get all the usual safety electronics though – stability and traction control, anti-lock brakes and automatic-flashing for the stoplights when the brakes are applied hard – and an airbag count of six (no driver's knee bag though) to help qualify for a full five-star ANCAP rating.

Add all this up, and the mid-size Hyundai is a worthy mid-size contender. It has the packaging, performance and on-road dynamics to challenge anything thrown at it by its competitors and is well put together besides.

Welcome back, Sonata.

After thoroughly teasing the next-generation Elantra Hyundai is finally unveiling its latest sedan for the South Korean market where it's called the ""Avante"" While the names might be different expect the revised model to look just like this for the North American debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November Although the powertrain range might be tweaked when crossing the Pacific 

Hyundai is reworking the swoopy Fluidic Sculpture design language into a sleeker simpler shape for the latest Elantra and the company calls the new direction ""Modern Premium"" Up front there's a big hexagonal grill to grab attention and it's matched with squinting headlights on each side The roof now simply flows back elegantly to the trunk and the sides are left largely unadorned beyond an understated crease along the shoulders At the rear narrowing taillights stretch horizontally across the trunk Also while the upgraded styling is meant to make the Elantra look low and wide the dimensions grow less than an inch in length and width 

Beneath the upgraded design is a revised platform that's made of 53 percent advanced high strength steel versus 32 percent before The result is a stiffer frame that Hyundai claims leads to better crash test results and lower NVH Drivers get added security from a safety suite that includes autonomous emergency braking high beam assist blind spot detection and rear cross traffic alert 

Hyundai is clear that powertrains can vary with region but South Koreans get three choices in the Avante A 16-liter gasoline-fueled four-cylinder offers 130 horsepower and 119 pound-feet of torque and a 16-liter diesel makes 134 hp and 221 lb-ft There's also a 20-liter petrol mill running on the Atkinson cycle that produces 147 hp and 132 lb-ft Rumors suggest North America might get the turbocharged 16-liter from the latest Tucson with 175 hp and 196 lb-ft Show full PR text Hyundai Motor Holds World Premiere of All-new Elantra in Korea

The All-new Elantra is the latest model to employ Hyundai Motor's characteristic design philosophy which embraces the company's 'Modern Premium' brand direction and is evident in the All-new Elantra's dynamic and refined form The result is unique beauty both inside and outside of the car The All-new Elantra preserves the essence of the previous car's well-received aesthetics while giving greater emphasis to simple and harmonious design The All-new Elantra expresses modernity through easy-to-understand and pleasing design fundamentals visible in the rich visuotactile colors materials and premium levels of finish 

Exterior Design 

The front of the All-new Elantra uses expressive features to portray its refined character A large 

single-frame hexagonal grille is flanked by slim and sporty headlights flowing into the sculpted body panels A low and wide proportion was achieved by lowering the head lamp and positioning it in the far end of the left and right corner The car's clean sleek and refined surfaces build on the active stance of the All-new Elantra Hyundai Motor's designers paid particular attention to the design of the wheel arches with the goal of expressing the car's dynamic road presence helping to set the new model apart from all other vehicles on the road The result is a sense of condensed energy immediately before a leap 

At the rear the All-new Elantra's unique personality is reinforced by the distinctive shining tail lights arranged within an organized and attractive horizontal line The bold rear bumper adds the final premium touch completing a clean balanced design 

The distinguished range of exterior colors follow Hyundai Motor's commitment to meeting the preferences of a wide range of customers with 10 options – ranging from subtle base colors to vibrant stand-out shades These colors reflect the positioning of the car as 'comfortable fashionable and sporty' and outline Hyundai Motor's ambition to change perceptions of the brand 

Interior Design 

The interior has been ergonomically designed to enable intuitive operation with refined active character lines The relaxed and comfortable atmosphere is created with neatly arranged aesthetics inherited from cars higher up the Hyundai Motor's range such as the Genesis and Sonata Soft-touch and high-quality materials are introduced across the cabin surfaces creating a refined cabin ambience Buttons on the dashboard were regrouped ergonomically according to its functions The cockpit layout was composed focusing on driver comfort and convenience 

In addition details added to rear air conditioner vents and inside door handles allow one to enjoy premium value never felt before in compact sedans

Moreover a 027Cd of Air Resistance Coefficient the highest in the segment was achieved by applying design elements that enhance aerodynamics The Wheel Air Curtain minimized the air twisting around the wheel area during driving Additional applications of Bumper Ribs and Undercover underneath the All-New Elantra improved aerodynamics and optimized the under-body structure showing improvements from the previous design 

For improved durability and handling the All-new Elantra went through extensive on-the-road and laboratory testing and circuit-based testing at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam venue for the Formula 1 World Championship 

4 Safety 

The introduction of new technologies means the All-new Elantra is one of the most comprehensively equipped vehicles in its segment when it comes to safety features 

An impressive 53 percent of the All-new Elantra's steel is Advanced High Strength Steel AHSS an increase of 32 percent over the previous generation model AHSS components are used to both increase stiffness and more effectively protect passengers helping the All-new Elantra to achieve top-class safety ratings in the company's internal tests 

The car is fitted with an Autonomous Emergency Braking AEB system an advanced active safety feature that alerts drivers to unexpected emergency situations braking autonomously if required Using radar and camera sensors AEB operates in three stages initially warning the driver visually and acoustically while gradually increasing the braking force When a potential accident with the vehicle in front or a pedestrian is detected the brakes will be activated when the vehicle is travelling faster than 10 kmh However the driver has to keep in mind that the system only activates under a preset speed 

For the safety and protection of drivers in oncoming vehicles the High Beam Assist HBA function automatically detects an approaching vehicle and dips the All-new Elantra's high beam headlights at night to reduce glare When the system no longer detects a vehicle ahead it re-activates the high beam to provide a clearer field of vision for the driver 

The Blind Spot Detector BSD with Lane Change Assist LCA using radar technology monitors the rear corners and if another vehicle is detected a visual alert appears on the exterior mirrors Then an audible signal is emitted when the driver tries to change lanes to where the vehicle is approaching This also applies for a lane change situation when another vehicle is approaching at high speed 

Using the BSD sensors the Rear Cross Traffic Alert RCTA system reduces the risk of collision with approaching traffic when reversing out of narrow areas with low visibility Using a radar to scan 180-degrees behind the vehicle for approaching cross-traffic RCTA alerts the driver visually and acoustically 

5 Convenience Features 

The All-new Elantra delivers enhanced driver convenience The Integrated Memory Seat IMS remembers a driver's preferred seating position and can return the seat to the optimal position if another driver has adjusted it 

The eye-catching supervision cluster focusing on high technology also adds to driver convenience with pleasing illumination and a sophisticated graphic animated on the display Furthermore visibility is enhanced with smart instrument lighting which adds a modern ambience 

Last but not least an innovative function to aid loading at the rear of the car is included in the All-new Elantra Smart Trunk automatically opens the trunk when the Smart Key is within the rear bumper sensing zone over 3 seconds saving time and effort for the driver 

6 Noise Vibration and Harshness NVH 

To create a true world-class compact-size sedan Hyundai Motor's engineers were set two clear 

targets reducing road noise and improving high-frequency noise in the engine when accelerating to a more linear engine sound by fine tuning NVH Re-engineered windscreen wipers that are carefully positioned dramatically reduce road and wind noise in the cabin while the thickened door glass significantly reduces noise penetration 

The dedication to improve NVH even extends to new rear-wheel guard materials highlighting Hyundai's commitment to continually improving its products in every detail 

NVH levels dB for the All-new Elantra All-new 64 7 Powertrains 

The All-new Elantra is available in a wider range of engine and transmission options to better meet the requirements and preferences of all customers 

A Nu 20 MPi Atkinson engine delivers maximum drivability in all driving conditions to meet the needs of customers that prefer high performance With maximum horsepower of 149ps and torque of 183 kg·m the All-new Elantra achieved strong performance comparable to that of the midsize sedan segment

Top Speed:109 mph Posted on 09.20.2015 12:00 by Ciprian Florea +   Having launched a redesigned 2015 Hyundai i20 in 2014, Hyundai needed less than a year to expand the nameplate’s lineup to no fewer than four models. After the 2015 Hyundai i20 Coupe , unveiled in late 2014, it introduced the i20 Active in India in March 2015 and the race-spec 2016 Hyundai i20 WRC at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show . The Koreans also used the show to present the i20 Active to European enthusiasts as an alternative to the Volkswagen CrossPolo.
Basically a raised, more rugged-looking version of the subcompact hatchback, the i20 Active is aimed at customers with active lifestyles and drivers who need a small car that’s also useful on poor-quality roads outside the city. It’s also part of the Hyundai aggressive campaign to expand into as many niches as possible.
“With the introduction of New i20 Active we further diversify our offering in the B-segment with an attractive crossover model,” said Thomas A. Schmid, COO at Hyundai Motor Europe. “In 2015 our entire crossover and SUV line-up has been renewed, as part of our youngest ever model range in Europe. And with the introduction of our 1.0-litre turbocharged engine, we further enhance our customer proposition in the European B-Segment.”
As you might have already guessed, the i20 Active won’t be offered in North America. Keep reading to find out what you’re missing.

Although Hyundai claims that over half of the exterior parts differ from the standard model, the Active remains recognizable as an i20. In essence, it’s a regular hatchback with skid plates, side cladding, and crossover-like side skirts and wheel-arch moldings. Upon closer inspection though, the i20 Active active also features reshaped bumpers front and rear (with integrated round foglamps), a revised rear spoiler, and a new front grille finished in high-gloss black with a chrome frame. Other add-ons that contribute to the car’s more rugged appearance include a silver fuel cap cover, 17-inch wheels, and a set of roof rails. The Active also gained an exclusive exterior color dubbed Morning Blue.

The i20 Active’s interior is identical to the standard i20’s, except for only a few modifications. These include a higher driving position, a longer center console that extends toward the front seat backs, and metal pedals for a more robust, crossover-like appearance. Other than that, everything is like in the redesigned i20 hatch Hyundai launched in 2014, including the optional Tangerine Orange accents for the seats and air vents.
Naturally, the Active benefits from the i20’s superior space and comfort, which come by way of improved ergonomics, softer materials, and longer wheelbase. The Koreans claim the i20 offers best-in-class front and rear combined legroom, as well as class-leading cargo space of 326 liters (11.5 cubic feet).
Although the standard i20 benefits from a class-exclusive panoramic roof, that option isn’t available for the i20 Active.Drivetrain
Motivation for the i20 Active comes from the same 1.4-liter gasoline and diesel engines available with the standard i20, plus a new, ultra-efficient, three-cylinder unit displacing one liter that can be had with two power outputs.
A new, ultra-efficient, three-cylinder unit displacing one liter can be had with two power outputs.
The least powerful version cranks out 98 horses and 126 pound-feet of torque and takes the i20 Active from 0 to 62 mph in 10.9 seconds and up to a top speed of 109 mph. A more powerful version with 118 horses and 126 pound-feet slashes more than a half-second off the 0-to-62 mph sprint, taking it down to 10.3 ticks. Top speed increases to 114 mph.
The new unit features a turbocharger with electric waste gate actuator, which improves fuel efficiency by lowering pumping losses as well. It also enhances throttle response and low-end torque. An optimized split-cooling concept for the cylinder head and block reduces friction.
To keep the engine as small as possible, Hyundai integrated the exhaust manifold within the cylinder head, a modification that also enables a more efficient cooling process using the cylinder head’s water cooling system.
The second gasoline engine in the lineup is a 1.4-liter four-banger that delivers 98 horsepower and 99 pound-feet of twist. Finally, Hyundai offers an 89-horsepower, 1.4-liter diesel as an option.Drivetrain Specifications

The i20 Active comes with the same safety features as the standard i20, meaning it sports six airbags (front, front side, and full length curtain) and child seat anchors. Technology includes Lane Departure Warning, Vehicle Stability Management, Electronic Stability Program, Anti-Lock Brakes, and Hill-Start Assist.Prices
Pricing for the i20 Active is not yet available, but it should be a bit more expensive than the hatchback. In Germany, the new i20 retails from €11,990 (about $13,630). My best guess is it will fetch around €14,500 (about $16,500) before options.Competition2011 Volkswagen CrossPolo Developed as a mini SUV version of the Polo and a smaller alternative to the CrossGolf, the CrossPolo is the i20 Active’s sole competitor in Europe. The German hatch is offered with five engines and three transmissions. A 1.2-liter, four-cylinder gasoline unit is available with 89 and 108 horsepower, while a 1.0-liter three-pot pumps out 108 horses. On the diesel front, the CrossPolo features a 1.4-liter four-banger with 89 and 104 horsepower. Transmission options include a five-speed manual, six-speed manual, and a seven-speed DSG. Pricing starts from €18,675 (around $21,210), which represents a €6,000 (about $6,815) premium over the base model.

Although I don’t see how the i20 Active will steal too many customers from the CrossPolo, the fact of the matter is Hyundai has made tremendous progress with the new i20. The new design language brings the hatchback in line with its European counterparts, while the new 1.0-liter engine enables it to give the three-cylinder-powered Golfs and Fiestas a run for their money in the fuel economy department. I think Hyundai could’ve done just fine without a crossover version of the i20, but the Active proves the brand is very serious about expanding into previously unexplored segments. It remains to be seen whether the i20 Active was a good idea or not.

Press Release
At the Frankfurt International Motor Show 2015, Hyundai Motor is introducing the New Hyundai i20 Active, a rugged compact crossover for customers with active lifestyles.
Further expanding the popular i20 range, the New i20 Active will go on sale in Europe in early 2016, joining the spacious, functional i20 five-door and the sporty, individual i20 Coupe. The car’s arrival also broadens Hyundai Motor’s European crossover and SUV offering to four models - alongside the All-New Tucson, New Santa Fe and New Grand Santa Fe* – each new or enhanced in 2015.
*Not available in the UK market
“With the introduction of New i20 Active we further diversify our offering in the B-segment with an attractive crossover model,” explains Thomas A. Schmid, Chief Operating Officer at Hyundai Motor Europe. “In 2015 our entire crossover and SUV line-up has been renewed, as part of our youngest ever model range in Europe. And with the introduction of our 1.0-litre turbocharged engine, we further enhance our customer proposition in the European B-Segment.”
2. Design
New Hyundai i20 Active’s rugged crossover design enhances appeal and increases versatility
Over half of exterior parts differ from standard i20 model
Higher seating position adds to comfort and aids visibility
The distinctive and rugged crossover design of the i20 Active sets it apart from conventional B-segment models. While the new car is based on the i20 five-door – sharing its expansive space, comfort and quality – over 50% of the exterior parts are unique to this model.
To give the i20 Active a characteristic crossover stance, revised suspension settings elevate the body of the i20 Active by 20 mm compared to the i20 five-door. The seating position is also raised, placing the driver higher within the car. The result makes ingress and egress more comfortable, as well as offering superior visibility while driving.
Underlining the i20 Active’s adventurous appeal are the unique front and rear bumpers with integrated skid plates, which offer additional protection when driving away from public roads. Round fog lamps are integrated at the front and rear, with an exclusive rear spoiler adding to the i20 Active’s appeal.
The rugged appearance is further enhanced by bold side skirts and side cladding, to complement the robust wheel-arch mouldings. Moving to the top of the car, a set of silver roof rails complement the crossover’s stance, adding essential practicality.
Other details that set i20 Active apart from its siblings include a reverse treatment of the signature Hyundai hexagonal grille in high-gloss black with chrome surroundings, a fuel cap cover in silver finish and newly designed 17-inch wheels.
The interior benefits from the superior space, comfort and quality of the i20 five-door, with greater ergonomics from the heightened driving position and further design enhancements. Unique metal pedals present a robust and high quality appearance, while Tangerine Orange interior colour applications expand the personalisation options. Also exclusive to the i20 Active is the Morning Blue exterior colour, a distinctive option for those wanting a bespoke finish.
“The New i20 Active’s rugged design and crossover features target young urban customers with active lifestyles,” says Raf Van Nuffel, Head of Product Management at Hyundai Motor Europe. “The higher stance and the bespoke design enhancements express the car’s adventurous spirit without compromising the spaciousness and comfort of the i20 five-door version.”
3. Engines
New efficient 1.0-litre T-GDI engine introduced to the i20 family
Three-cylinder turbocharged direct injection engine with 100 PS and 120 PS (dependent on model)
First of a new generation of in-house developed small petrol turbo-charged engines for Europe
Coinciding with the arrival of the i20 Active comes the introduction of a new engine for the i20 family. Focused on dynamic and efficient driving, the new Kappa 1.0-litre T-GDI three-cylinder turbocharged direct injection engine will be available to the i20 range in early 2016.
The 1.0-litre T-GDI engine is available in two power outputs. The standard-power 100 PS version is tuned to maximise fuel economy and focuses on comfort, while the high-power 120 PS* unit has been developed to facilitate more spirited driving without sacrificing efficiency.
*available subject to market specification
“The new 1.0-litre T-GDI is a perfect fit for the i20 family,” states Dr. Michael Winkler, Head of Powertrain at Hyundai Motor’s European Technical Center in Rüsselsheim. “A downsized 1.0-litre 3-cylinder engine with direct gasoline injection and a matched compact turbocharger with electrical wastegate actuator offers customers not only fuel economy but also driving pleasure.”
These fuel efficient Kappa engines, which achieve up to 61.4 mpg and CO2 emissions as low as 106 g\/km, are the first of a new generation of newly-developed small, turbocharged power plants tuned for Europe. Hyundai Motor’s European Technical Center in Germany played a key role in the engine’s research, development, engineering and testing, specifically for use on European roads.
The new engine features highly efficient combustion and dynamic performance to fulfil Hyundai’s dedication to implementing downsizing as a fuel saving technology. The standard 100 PS version and the high power 120 PS version both deliver a peak torque of 171.6 Nm at 1,500 rpm providing a perfect combination of dynamism and efficiency.
A turbo charger with electric waste gate actuator improves fuel efficiency by lowering pumping losses as well as improving throttle response and low-end torque. An optimised split-cooling concept for the cylinder head and block brings engine refinement by reducing friction.
To keep the engine unit as small as possible, the exhaust manifold is integrated within the cylinder head and can therefore be cooled efficiently using the cylinder head water cooling system. These efforts result in faster warm-up of the catalyst and ultimately in improved real-world fuel consumption and emissions.
The i20 Active will also be available with a 1.4-litre Kappa engine. The 1,368 cc four-cylinder gasoline engine delivers 100 PS and 134.4 Nm of torque.
As an alternative to gasoline, a 1.4-litre U II diesel engine comes as an optional extra for the i20 Active, just as it does for the i20 five-door and i20 Coupe. This 90 PS diesel engine is fuel efficient yet refined in operation.
*Neither 1.4-litre Kappa engine or 1.4-litre diesel engine available in UK

Aug. 11, 2015 – Hyundai Motor America suggested a “Vision G” Concept Coupe to a name organisation of media during a Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). The judgment was described as Hyundai’s impulse for a family of destiny reward products that guarantee luxury, opening and character with a value and shortcoming that is a substructure of Hyundai’s brand. “The judgment was designed with concurrent submit from Hyundai pattern studios around a world, though was led by a group here in a U.S.,” pronounced Peter Schreyer, Hyundai’s boss and arch pattern officer. “The pattern is a interpretation of a thought that Hyundai breathes into all of a vehicles – a DNA that balances pattern and opening with a thought that we don’t need to be over a tip in terms of glitz and stereotypical oppulance cues.” During a pattern process, Hyundai’s group of designers centered their work on a thought of “chivalry” – a word they felt best tangible a thought that one doesn’t need to scream to be beheld and respected. “Vision G” is purposefully understated, notwithstanding a distance and thespian lines. One instance of this deferential oppulance – and a curtsy to a confidence of a motorist – is a record that automatically opens a doorway as if being non-stop by a valet. The extraneous styling of a judgment is highlighted by a prolonged hood, high-beltline and a cabin that presents a slingshot-like appearance. “In gripping with a pattern that speaks to a owners rather than ‘the spectators’ who competence see a automobile on a road, Vision G appears energetic and in consistent motion,” pronounced Christopher Chapman, conduct of Hyundai’s U.S. pattern core and personality of a coupe’s pattern team. “After all – and if all is right in a universe – a usually time an owners sees a extraneous of a automobile is when it’s station still.” The underlying thought of deferential oppulance flows into a interior, underscored by a clarity and simplicity. No vivid examples of luxury, though rather glorious lines and finishes. The heart of “Vision G” is a award-winning 5.0-liter Tau V8 engine producing 420 horsepower during 6,000 rpm and 383 lb. ft. of torque during 5,000 rpm. The Tau V8 engine family has been named to Ward’s prestigious Ten Best Engines list 3 times. With high-pressure approach injection for considerable power, low emissions and glorious efficiency, this latest chronicle of a Tau V8 advantages from an optimized intake curtain length, extended timing sequence for reduced attrition and NVH, low-torque empty manifold, increasing application ratio and upgraded multiple-injection mapping. These enhancements mix to furnish a agree torque bend during reduce rpm for even improved driveability. “Vision G” will subsequent be shown during a Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance on Sunday, Aug 16 in Monterey, Calif. Tags: HYUNDAI, NEWS. Hyundai Elantra World Premiere Ahead Frankfurt. The South Korean automaker unveiled today the sixth generation Hyundai Elantra at company’s Global R&D Center in Namyang, South Korea where the car has been engineered and designed.

Styling The All-new Elantra is the latest model to employ Hyundai Motor’s characteristic design philosophy, which embraces the company’s ‘Modern Premium’ brand direction and is evident in the All-new Elantra’s dynamic and refined form. The result is unique beauty both inside and outside of the car. The All-new Elantra preserves the essence of the previous car’s well-received aesthetics, while giving greater emphasis to simple and harmonious design. The All-new Elantra expresses modernity through easy-to-understand and pleasing design fundamentals, visible in the rich visuotactile colors, materials and premium levels of finish. Exterior Design The front of the All-new Elantra uses expressive features to portray its refined character. A large
single-frame hexagonal grille is flanked by slim and sporty headlights, flowing into the sculpted body panels. A low and wide proportion was achieved by lowering the head lamp and positioning it in the far end of the left and right corner. The car’s clean, sleek and refined surfaces build on the active stance of the All-new Elantra. Hyundai Motor’s designers paid particular attention to the design of the wheel arches, with the goal of expressing the car’s dynamic road presence, helping to set the new model apart from all other vehicles on the road. The result is a sense of condensed energy immediately before a leap. At the rear, the All-new Elantra’s unique personality is reinforced by the distinctive shining tail lights arranged within an organized and attractive horizontal line. The bold rear bumper adds the final premium touch, completing a clean, balanced design. The distinguished range of exterior colors follow Hyundai Motor’s commitment to meeting the preferences of a wide range of customers with 10 options – ranging from subtle base colors to vibrant, stand-out shades. These colors reflect the positioning of the car as ‘comfortable, fashionable and sporty’ and outline Hyundai Motor’s ambition to change perceptions of the brand. Interior Design The interior has been ergonomically designed to enable intuitive operation with refined active character lines. The relaxed and comfortable atmosphere is created with neatly arranged aesthetics inherited from cars higher up the Hyundai Motor’s range such as the Genesis and Sonata. Soft-touch and high-quality materials are introduced across the cabin surfaces, creating a refined cabin ambience. Buttons on the dashboard were regrouped ergonomically according to its functions. The cockpit layout was composed focusing on driver comfort and convenience. In addition, details added to rear air conditioner vents and inside door handles allow one to enjoy premium value never felt before in compact sedans. Trendy colors and high-grade materials represent the company’s reinterpretation of modernity, while the four different interior colors reflect key aims of ‘comfortable, fashionable and sporty’. The All-new Elantra has also been redesigned to focus on driver comfort. The cockpit display is angled 6.9 degrees towards the driver with an intuitive layout, while aesthetic enhancements within the crash pad and center fascia are designed to appeal to a wider range of customers. In addition, the central console has a sliding-type tray cover and armrest for complete driver convenience. 3. Driving Performance To optimize drivability, the All-new Elantra benefits from a number of upgrades that boost ride and handling. The suspension geometry has been redesigned to provide greater control and improve ride quality, compared to the previous model. Changes to the layout of the suspension components, including the rear shock absorber and spring positioning, are complemented by structural enhancements to strengthen the chassis. These not only bring increased ride comfort for occupants, but also make elaborate driving possible with a gentle on-center feel. Steering feel has been further increased thanks to the improvement of the Motor Driven Power Steering (MDPS) giving smooth, stable handling and better responses at different speeds. Moreover, a 0.27Cd of Air Resistance Coefficient, the highest in the segment, was achieved by applying design elements that enhance aerodynamics. The Wheel Air Curtain minimized the air twisting around the wheel area during driving. Additional applications of Bumper Ribs and Undercover underneath the All-New Elantra improved aerodynamics and optimized the under-body structure, showing improvements from the previous design. For improved durability and handling, the All-new Elantra went through extensive on-the-road and laboratory testing and circuit-based testing at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam, venue for the Formula 1 World Championship. 4. Safety The introduction of new technologies means the All-new Elantra is one of the most comprehensively equipped vehicles in its segment when it comes to safety features. An impressive 53 percent of the All-new Elantra’s steel is Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS), an increase of 32 percent over the previous generation model. AHSS components are used to both increase stiffness and more effectively protect passengers, helping the All-new Elantra to achieve top-class safety ratings in the company’s internal tests. The car is fitted with an Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system, an advanced active safety feature that alerts drivers to unexpected emergency situations, braking autonomously if required. Using radar and camera sensors, AEB operates in three stages, initially warning the driver visually and acoustically, while gradually increasing the braking force. When a potential accident with the vehicle in front or a pedestrian is detected, the brakes will be activated when the vehicle is travelling faster than 10 km\/h. However, the driver has to keep in mind that the system only activates under a preset speed. For the safety and protection of drivers in oncoming vehicles, the High Beam Assist (HBA) function automatically detects an approaching vehicle and dips the All-new Elantra’s high beam headlights at night to reduce glare. When the system no longer detects a vehicle ahead, it re-activates the high beam to provide a clearer field of vision for the driver. The Blind Spot Detector (BSD) with Lane Change Assist (LCA), using radar technology, monitors the rear corners and, if another vehicle is detected, a visual alert appears on the exterior mirrors. Then, an audible signal is emitted when the driver tries to change lanes to where the vehicle is approaching. This also applies for a lane change situation when another vehicle is approaching at high speed. Using the BSD sensors, the Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) system reduces the risk of collision with approaching traffic when reversing out of narrow areas with low visibility. Using a radar to scan 180-degrees behind the vehicle for approaching cross-traffic, RCTA alerts the driver visually and acoustically. 5. Convenience Features The All-new Elantra delivers enhanced driver convenience. The Integrated Memory Seat (IMS) remembers a driver’s preferred seating position and can return the seat to the optimal position if another driver has adjusted it. The eye-catching supervision cluster focusing on high technology also adds to driver convenience, with pleasing illumination and a sophisticated graphic animated on the display.  Furthermore, visibility is enhanced with smart instrument lighting which adds a modern ambience. Last but not least, an innovative function to aid loading at the rear of the car is included in the All-new Elantra. Smart Trunk automatically opens the trunk when the Smart Key is within the rear bumper sensing zone over 3 seconds, saving time and effort for the driver. 6. Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) To create a true world-class compact-size sedan, Hyundai Motor’s engineers were set two clear
targets; reducing road noise and improving high-frequency noise in the engine when accelerating to a more linear engine sound by fine tuning NVH. Re-engineered windscreen wipers that are carefully positioned dramatically reduce road and wind noise in the cabin, while the thickened door glass significantly reduces noise penetration. The dedication to improve NVH even extends to new rear-wheel guard materials, highlighting Hyundai’s commitment to continually improving its products in every detail.

Dina Manzo Reportedly Has a New Man in Her Life. Listen up, Dina Manzo  might have a new man in her life. According to the latest gossip, the  Real Housewives of New Jersey  alum is dating Dave Canti, following her split from her husband of seven years, Tommy, which she announced back in February. According to the Daily Mail , the duo met at a fundraising event for her Project Ladybug charity last year, and they have since  attended the Hampton Sun’s 10th anniversary event together back in June. “They've been together for a while,” a source tells  Us Weekly   about Dina and Dave. 
 
The  Daily Mail  adds that Dave now works as a commercial broker following the sale of his Hyundai dealership in New Jersey over the summer. He is also recently separated from his wife, with whom he has two kids. He reportedly spoke to the publication about his relationship with Dina, noting that she was by his side while he battled leukemia. ""I'm now in full remission and as healthy as you are but yes Dina was there for me through some difficult times and she helped me through them,"" he said. 
 
Back in August, Manzo'd With Children   mom Caroline Manzo opened up about her current relationship status with her sister, during which she revealed that Dina now lives on the West Coast. ""She lives in California now — she moved out to L.A.,"" she shared on Watch What Happens Live (below). ""But, as much as I can see her, I see her. We text and stuff like that."" 
 
Here's a glimpse of Dina's life out West. . Volkwagen’s EPA Dustup Could Be Just Start of Troubles With U.S. Government. NEW YORK  ( TheStreet ) -- Sanctions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may be just the beginning of Volkswagen AG 's legal and financial troubles in connection with what appears a deliberate evasion of federal clean-air laws. 
 
Recent criminal prosecutions of General Motors   and Toyota Motor   suggest that an activist U.S. Department of Justice may decide to open an investigation into whether other federal laws were violated. Last week, GM agreed to pay $900 million to settle federal wire fraud charges that it had concealed potentially deadly safety defects in ignition switches. 
 
On Friday, the Obama administration accused VW of deceiving EPA regulators about the level of toxic emissions in nearly half a million diesel VWs and Audis sold in the U.S. since 2008. The automaker, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, evidently rigged software on emissions controls to operate the engine in one way during tests and differently when driven by owners. 
 
A VW spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, said Saturday that the automaker is cooperating with the investigation. 
 
""Given the nature of what VW is being accused of I would expect that criminal charges are almost certainly forthcoming. If true, there is no way this can be passed off as a procedural mistake as was the case with the fuel economy problems at Hyundai and Ford. This appears to be very deliberate if true,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, a senior analyst with Navigant. 
 
Last year, Ford Motor   was forced to restate fuel-economy ratings for some of its vehicles and send refunds of $200 to $1,050 to about 200,000 customers. In 2012, Hyundai Motor   and its Kia Motors   affiliate had to relabel fuel-economy ratings some models sold in the U.S. 
 
The U.S. will order a recall of the affected vehicles, which may receive new software that improves emissions while reducing power and fuel economy. Under EPA rules, VW could be subject to as much as $18 billion in fines -- a stunning sum that, if levied, could stagger the automaker financially in the short term. 
 
On Friday, VW shares and ADRs fell up to 5% in heavy trading on news of the EPA charges. 
 
For VW, whose announced goal is to surpass Toyota as the world's No. 1 automaker, the dust-up with the EPA is the latest in a series of setbacks. In April, a published comment about Martin Winterkorn, chief executive officer, by then chairman Ferdinand Piech in a German magazine ignited a shakeup in senior management and Piech's exit from VW's supervisory board. Piech remains a major VW shareholder. 
 
Last year, VW workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee narrowly voted down representation by the United Auto Workers union. The election created an uproar among politicians and business groups in the state, who suspected VW might be pushing unionization to mollify pro-union advocates in Germany.

TUCSON FUEL CELL ADVANTAGES 

The Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell CUV has a number of advantages over some other alternative fuels. The energy-rich hydrogen fuel provides an estimated driving range of 265 miles between fill-ups, similar to many gasoline vehicles. Further, both fuel cell driving range and vehicle performance are minimally affected by either extreme hot or cold ambient temperatures, giving owners an extra measure of peace of mind as they go about their day. Even more important for consumers transitioning from gasoline vehicles, the Tucson Fuel Cell can be refilled with hydrogen in about the same time as a typical gasoline vehicle of the same size.

Finally, fuel cell vehicles, due to their compact, relatively lightweight fuel cell stack design, are completely production scalable from very small to very large vehicles, such as urban-focused mini-compact cars all the way to full-size buses and trucks.

SHEFFIELD, UK—ITM Power, a UK-based energy storage and clean fuel company, has opened its first public-access hydrogen refuelling station. 

Located in South Yorkshire, close to the large population centres of Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster, the station is the first of its kind in the UK. It consists of a 225 kilowatt wind turbine coupled with an electrolyser, 220 kilograms of hydrogen storage space and a dispensing unit. It also houses a 30 kilowatt fuel cell system capable of providing backup power to nearby buildings. 

“We are extremely pleased to be launching the first of the company’s hydrogen refuelling stations today, at this very accessible location off the M1 in South Yorkshire, and to provide clean fuel for the fuel cell electric vehicles that are now available from the auto OEMs,” Graham Cooley, CEO of ITM Power, said. 

“This station will provide important reference for demystifying the ability to utilise renewable energy supply for its efficient conversion to clean fuel for clean transport emissionits, that is enabled by ITM’s rapid response PEM electrolyser platform and the super impreimpressive performance of fuel cell electric cars,” he added. 

The station’s launch was supported by Hyundai, Toyota and Honda, all of which showcased their hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. 

“It is very encouraging indeed that the UK’s hydrogen filling station infrastructure is developing,” Tony Whitehorn, CEO of Hyundai Motor UK, said, “We welcome this ultra-green new site in the north of England, which will serve a very large area and is clearly one of the most advanced sites ever constructed.”. Hyundai announces launch of i20 Active compact SUVs. Hyundai has unveiled a new i20 Active compact SUV that will join the i20 five-door and i20 Coupe in Europe from early 2016. 

Billed as a “a rugged compact crossover for customers with active lifestyles”, the model will join the carmaker’s existing Tucson, Santa Fe and Grand Santa Fe SUVs. 
 
“With the introduction of New i20 Active we further diversify our offering in the B-segment with an attractive crossover model,” said Thomas Schmid, chief operating officer at Hyundai Motor Europe. “In 2015 our entire crossover and SUV line-up has been renewed, as part of our youngest ever model range in Europe. And with the introduction of our 1.0-litre turbocharged engine, we further enhance our customer proposition in the European B-Segment.” 
 
Although the i20 Active is based on the i20 five-door, Hyundai noted that over 50% of the exterior parts  are unique to this model. Stand-out features include revised suspension settings that raise the model 20mm along with a higher seating position. 
 
Styling brings bespoke front and rear bumpers with integrated skid plates, round fog lamps front and rear, with an exclusive rear spoiler, side skirts and side cladding plus robust wheel-arch mouldings and silver roof rails. 
 
The new model also marks the launch of a new Kappa three-cylinder 1.0-litre T-GDI engine to the i20 family, marking the first of a new generation of newly-developed small, turbocharged power plants tuned for Europe. The unit is available in two power outputs – 100hp and 120hp – and brings official combined fuel economy of 4.6l\/100km with CO2 emissions from 106g\/km. 
 
In mainland Europe, the i20 Active will also be available with a 100hp 1.4-litre Kappa petrol engine and the 90hp 1.4-litre U II diesel engine also available in the i20 five-door and i20 Coupe. All models are front-wheel drive only. 
 
Connectivity solutions see TomTom LIVE Services available across the i20 range from early 2016 onwards. 
 
The i20 Active will be produced alongside the i20 family at Hyundai Assan Otomotiv Sanayi (HAOS) plant in Izmit, Turkey.. Hyundai i30 could be offered with 1.0-litre turbo three-cylinder. The Hyundai i30 could be set for a new high-tech, downsized petrol powerplant. 
 
Hyundai Motor Europe head of powertrain development, Dr Michael Winkler, told Australian media at the 2015 Frankfurt motor show that the Hyundai i30 small hatch could follow the lead of the European-market Kia Cee’d by being offered a three-cylinder engine. 
 
The Kia Cee’d recently received a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine that produces 90kW of power and 172Nm of torque. It’s sold solely with a six-speed manual, and is a specialist model for its home market to meet strict emissions regulations. 
 
That doesn’t mean, though, that the Hyundai i30 – Australia’s fourth-best selling car – will be offered globally with a downsized engine. CarAdvice understands that no i30 sold outside of Europe will be offered with the engine, as it is produced in Europe for Europe. 
 

 
Still, Winkler suggested that like the newer Hyundai i20 , the 1.0-litre engine is destined to be found under more bonnets in the future, including the i30. 
 
“The i30 and the Cee’d are brother and sister,” Winkler said. 
 
“So we have introduced the 1.0-litre three-cylinder as a downsizing concept being first in the Kia Cee’d, but next application will be in the Hyundai i20,” Winkler said. 
 
“We start in the C-segment, [the new engine] replaces the 1.4-litre or 1.6-litre, roughly – so that is, I think for C-segment, that is an excellent downsize concept,” he said. 
 

 
As for Australia, Winkler admitted he is focused mainly on the market in which he works – Europe. 
 
But he did say that if the engine makes for a good fit, there’s no reason the rollout couldn’t extend to other markets in the future. 
 
“If the vehicle weight and driving performance makes sense, it could be applied. So that is definitely another vehicle, not only the Cee’d, and the [cars smaller],” he said. 
 
Winkler admitted that three-cylinder engines aren’t to all tastes. The inherently unbalanced nature of the engine means they throb and warble under acceleration, lacking the linearity of four-cylinder engines. 
 

 
“With the three-cylinder you have a great challenge in terms of the NVH. From my understanding the 1.0-litre does it quite well when you drive the vehicle,” he said. 
 
Winkler said that engines smaller than three cylinders throw up even more challenges in terms of refinement. 
 
“If you have a two-cylinder it’s becoming even worse so you have to fit the engine and the vehicle,” he said before going on to suggest there are some engines that may come in the near future with a two-cylinder mode. 
 
“What we’ve shown is a four-cylinder with cylinder deactivation. When you run on two cylinders in the areas where it is very good for the fuel consumption, but you have the four-cylinder at the higher loads. 
 
“I think that’s a concept that makes a lot of sense.”. 2015 FRANKFURT IAA MOTOR SHOW: World debuts. Various world premieres were announced at the 2015 IAA Cars in Frankfurt am Main and we continued to update just-auto's global debuts list. Media preview days were 15 & 16 September.

Hope he likes hairless cats! Real Housewives of New Jersey alum Dina Manzo is dating a millionaire named Dave Cantin, multiple sources confirm to Us Weekly. 

PHOTOS: Former Real Housewives stars 

“They've been together for a while,” a source tells Us of the former Bravo star and the businessman, who recently sold his successful Hyundai dealership, Brad Benson Auto Group. 

Manzo, 43, who is mom to daughter Lexi with estranged husband Tommy Manzo, announced her split from Tommy in February. Cantin also recently separated from his wife, Melissa, with whom he shares two kids.

Hyundai i30 Series II Active X review. THE small car segment is a one of a select few holding its own against stampeding SUVs with the combination of reasonable pricing, technologically savvy inclusions lists and good on-road performances proving an irresistible mix. 
 
Hyundai's multi-awarding-winning i30 is among the most popular choices, captivating buyers with what has always been a value-for-money possibility. But even a successful brand cannot rest on its laurels, and the current model, first launched here three years ago, was starting to look a bit tired, especially since rivals have brought much improved product to the market. 
 
The new Series II has been timely for the i30 then, with subtle changes both inside and out, and the second-tier Active X, which Hyundai expects to account for more than 50% of sales, may just provide the impetus needed to make this new model as sought-after as the old. 
 
 Comfort  
 
The interior of the Series II i30 has been spruced up with a 5.0-inch infotainment touchscreen and reverse camera standard across the range. 
 
The screen itself and the graphic quality lag behind competitors, but it does feature Pandora radio app integration for smartphones, which is always an advantage in a technologically advanced age. 
 
The dash is uncluttered and user-friendly, but is looking a bit tired, lacking the sort of edginess that simply can't be accomplished with a few brush-metal highlights. 
  Hyundai i30 Series II Active X Photo: Contributed  Mark Bramley   
Button placement is good, though, especially on the steering wheel, and instruments are clear and easy to read. Seats are comfortable, with good support even in the rear, where a longish squab and tilted angle allow passengers to ride in comfort. 
 
 On the road  
 
The 1.8-litre petrol engine standard in the Active X is an unchanged carryover, bar a few tweaks to make it Euro V emissions-compliant. The changes have, however, left it with less torque and power, and with slightly higher fuel consumption. 
 
The numbers may be small, but the difference can be felt on the road, with the i30 labouring a bit, sometimes noisily, when exerted, especially up hills and when overtaking. The suspension, tuned for Australian conditions, is firm but composed, offering a consistent ride with its fair share of comfort. 
 
It does well on far-from-perfect roads, and although you can feel some of the smaller bumps, the larger ones go unnoticed. There are no real delusions of sportiness here, the i30 lacking the fierceness around corners shown by some rivals, with the nose straying and some body roll when pushed quickly around bends. Hyundai's FlexSteer system allows you to choose from Normal (our pick), Comfort or Sport, with the steering more engaging than its predecessor but with limited feedback. 
 
 What do you get?  
 
Aside from the aforementioned 5.0-inch touchscreen and reverse camera, the new i30 Active also gets a USB port, Bluetooth 
 
connectivity and iPod compatibility, 16-inch alloys, heated electric-folding mirrors, leather-appointed seats, cooled glove box and cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Safety features include seven airbags, ABS with EBD and brake assist as well as traction and stability control. 
  Hyundai i30 Series II Active X Photo: Contributed  Mark Bramley   
 Running costs  
 
Surprisingly, the i30 doesn't really impress in the frugality stakes with official figures at 7.3 litres\/100km. We used at least a litre more than that in a week that consisted largely of urban driving. 
 
Hyundai's after-sales package is strong though with a five-year unlimited kilometre warranty to sweeten the deal. There is free roadside assistance for a year and services are capped for the lifetime of the car with service intervals at 15,000km. 
 
 Competition  
 
Sales in this small car segment certainly haven't been affected by the popularity of SUVs and while the Mazda 3 (from $20,490) and Toyota Corolla (from $19,490) lead the pack, the popular Volkswagen Golf (from $25,640), Ford Focus (from $20,290) and Peugeot 308 (from $21,990) are also definitely in the picture. 
 
 Practicality  
 
The appeal of small cars lies in their ability to negotiate the confines of a city, their lower price point and maintenance and now, especially, their compatibility with technology. It helps if they can carry a couple of kids, too. 
 
Storage options in this i30 are both clever and generous. Not least of all among the storage features is the ample 378-litre boot that grows considerably to 1316l when the 60:40 seats are folded flat. 
 
A rear centre armrest is conspicuous by its absence, and while this can be explained away as a cost-cutting measure, rear air vents, also absent, are really a necessity. 
  Hyundai i30 Series II Active X Photo: Contributed  Mark Bramley   
 Funky factor  
 
A new horizontal-slatted grille, more in keeping with the rest of the Hyundai family, and sleek Euro-inspired lines coupled with nicely shaped LED lights and smart alloys give the i30 a distinguished modern air. 
 
 The lowdown  
 
Hyundai expects the Active X to be its volume seller, and has equipped it suitably for that mission. It is sharply priced, looks good, is extremely safe and has the on-trend technology required to attract younger buyers. 
 
 What matters most  
 
 What we liked: Comfortable interior, spacious for a small car, excellent warranty 
 
 What we'd like to see: Better fuel economy, rear air vents 
 
 Warranty and servicing: 5-year unlimited-kilometre warranty with fixed-price servicing for life

These projects, funded through the Next Generation Electric Machines funding opportunity, could cut energy waste by as much as 30%. The projects also aim to reduce the size of megawatt-scale motors and drive systems used in the chemical and petroleum refining industries, natural gas infrastructure, and general industry compressor applications like HVAC systems, refrigeration, and wastewater pumps by up to 50%. The industrial sector uses more than 30 percent of the energy consumed in the US and is projected to use more, not less, energy over the next twenty five years. Replacing less efficient industrial motor systems with more advanced, variable-speed direct-drive systems and incorporating recent power electronics advances, such as wide-bandgap semiconductors, could reduce industrial electricity consumption by 2 to 4 percent, leading to up to $2.7 billion in annual energy savings, reducing up to 27 million tons of carbon emissions each year, and creating high-quality manufacturing jobs.
These projects will leverage the work of the Department’s Power America Institute on WBG semiconductors for power electronics by deploying WBG technology to drive large power, industrial and high-speed electric motors and systems. WBG components—which control or convert electrical energy into usable power—operate at higher temperatures, voltages, and frequencies than silicon-based technologies. They are more durable and reliable, and can eliminate up to 90% of the power losses in electricity conversion compared to current technologies. By focusing on their specific application for large-scale motors, manufacturers can significantly improve the efficiency and productivity of processes ranging from small-scale machining to large-scale refining, pumping and cooling. The projects funded are: Calnetix Technologies will design, build and test a high-speed permanent magnet machine and a silicon carbide (SiC) based variable speed drive system using 4,160 volt medium voltage (MV) input. The new medium voltage motors are expected to achieve up to eight times the power density of similar traditional systems. General Electric Company will develop and demonstrate a medium voltage drive system using SiC semiconductors and a high-speed motor to reduce the system footprint and improve power density and efficiency. To achieve these targets, the program will focus on three technology areas: (i) SiC-based MV high frequency drive, (ii) a high-speed motor, and (iii) advanced insulation systems. Eaton Corporation will develop and test an integrated 15 kilovolt (kV) SiC variable-speed drive and high-speed megawatt motor for gas compression applications. This new drive technology will operate at greater than 99 percent efficiency and achieve 10 times the power density of competing drives, providing an integrated, highly-efficient motor and drive system for natural gas applications. Clemson University will develop a pre-commercial megawatt class variable speed drive based on new motor power converter technologies. The fully integrated prototype system will be made by TECO Westinghouse Motor Company in its Round Rock, TX facility and be demonstrated at Clemson’s eGRID Center. The Ohio State University will design, test, and demonstrate a high performance, high-speed drive capable of integrating into electric grids while avoiding energy losses associated with power transformers. If successful, the proposed project will significantly advance transformer-less drive technologies for a range of industries and motor applications. This effort is part of the Energy Department's broader Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative, which aims to increase American competitiveness in the production of clean energy products and boost US manufacturing competitiveness by increasing energy productivity.

5,mercedes-benz,"Mercedes Benz debuts sleek new C-Class Coupe - w\/videos. The German automakers really know how to make Coupes such as the A5\/S5 from Audi (updating soon), the 4- and 6-Series models from BMW, and from Mercedes Benz, the S-class Coupe and this latest C-Class Coupe. Mercedes is on a style roll with these coupes that look sleek, aerodynamic, and muscular\/aggressive all at the same time. While the press release is a global one, you can guess the engines and equipment that will come to the US. Expect the turbo fours and the eight-speed auto at the very least. It would be nice to get the more-powerful diesel in the C-Class Coupe as well, but... The new C Coupe gets all of Mercedes' latest like the AMG equipment, Agility Control. Airmatic suspension, DISTRONIC PLUS (with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot), AS PLUS Brake Assist System, Active Lane Keeping Assist, PRE‑SAFE® occupant protection, and much more as standard equipment or available in packages. The new body is stiffer and lighter which should aid performance and fuel economy. In other words, like most Mercedes models here in the US, you can spend lots of money or go crazy with the options and spend even more money. But look what you get...a new Coupe that is certainly worth lusting after. Mercedes will begin the roll out of the new C-Class Coupes in December. For more info, check out the global press release and three videos after the jump. More to come...

Press Release:
The new C-Class Coupé: Seduction of the heart and mind
Mercedes-Benz is adding a Coupé to its C-Class family. Athletic and sporty, the vivid, sensual design of the new Coupé cuts a fine figure on the road and embodies modern luxury. At the same time, its interior raises elegance and style to a sporty level. A dynamically configured chassis, with optional air suspension, forms the basis for a high level of suspension comfort, low road roar and tyre vibration, agile handling, and driving pleasure. Lightweight construction to reduce weight, excellent aerodynamics and high-performance yet efficient engines likewise contribute to this. New assistance systems provide safety of the very highest calibre. With its high-class appeal and generous interior, the new C-Class Coupé sets new standards in its segment. It arrives in December 2015.
""Our new C-Class Coupé continues the philosophy of our exciting coupés. It combines thrilling design with agile sportiness and modern luxury. The C-Class Coupé therefore clearly pledges itself to stylish driving enjoyment,"" states Prof. Dr. Thomas Weber, member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. As the sportiest variant of the C-Class, the Coupé displays its driving enjoyment-oriented character in an emotive and at the same time formally distinct design. A sportily striking front section featuring diamond radiator grille and long bonnet – the new Coupé is 60 millimetres longer than its predecessor between the firewall and front axle alone – gives way to a low greenhouse whose lines flow into a bold and powerful-looking rear end incorporating the Mercedes coupé genes. A high beltline and frameless doors with free-standing exterior mirrors underscore the sporty character. Clean lines and sensually arranged surfaces structure the side sections into vivid light and shadow effects. One particular highlight is the long drawn-out dropping line typical of a coupé. In contrast to the C-Class Saloon, the dropping line extends further past the rear wheel arch. To underscore the Coupé's sporty disposition, the suspension is 15 millimetres lower than that of the Saloon, making it a very sporty proposition when combined with the standard 17-inch tyres. Interior: generous, dynamic, exquisite
The interior is likewise a statement of the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy and combines emotion with intelligence. Although it exudes athletic and youthful charm, it has grown in maturity. Driver and passengers enjoy an ambience that leans toward the interior of the C-Class Saloon yet raises it to a new, sporty level. Flowing forms characterise the centre console as well as the door and rear side panelling, which smoothly merge into one another to emphasise the coupé character. The individually designed trim elements underscore the sporty character of the interior. A seating system including integral sports seats designed specifically for the Coupé offers sporty comfort. Plus there is an automatic belt feeder for added convenience. The choice of materials and the finish have a hand-crafted feel with high-class appeal and deliver a new take on modern luxury: sportiness without compromising on comfort and exquisite style. With an 80 millimetre longer wheelbase, the C-Class Coupé is 95 millimetres longer and 40 millimetres wider. The increased vehicle volume above all creates more spaciousness for the driver and front passenger. There is more shoulder room, elbow room and headroom in all seats. The unique position of the new C-Class Coupé is emphasised by the special upholstery colour combinations: saddle brown, porcelain and – in the Edition 1 – nut brown\/black with turquoise topstitching. Individual highlights
The Coupé features a wealth of equipment as standard. The AMG Line is available as an alternative to further underline the dynamism of the Coupé. It differs by virtue of exterior features such as special bumpers and sills featuring AMG bodystyling, a diamond radiator grille with pins in chrome and 18-inch AMG light-alloy wheels. Interior highlights of the AMG Line include sportily exclusive touches such as upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather\/DINAMICA microfibre in black with contrasting topstitching, a multifunction sports steering wheel with flattened bottom section and AMG sports pedals. The trim in open-pore black ash, combined with aluminium in the dashboard and the doors, emphasises the look. Another eye-catching feature is the optional Interior Chrome package featuring numerous highlights shrouded in silver chrome, including the instrument cluster, the air vents and the door openers. Suspension – sportily agile and comfortable
The suspension offers a high level of comfort with low road roar and tyre vibration whilst ensuring agile driving dynamics – the basis for driving enjoyment. A new 4-link front axle with wheel suspension decoupled from the spring strut plays a part in the agile handling characteristics. This enables sporty axle kinematics for plenty of grip and high lateral stability. As a result, the suspension responds more sensitively to steering movements and allows a sporty, agile driving style. Multi-link independent rear suspension with 5 links ensures excellent wheel location qualities and supreme straight-line stability. The Coupé comes with steel suspension as standard. There are two variants with selective damping system available in conjunction with this suspension, each of which is 15 millimetres lower than on the Saloon:
Comfortable AGILITY CONTROL suspension with a sporty character Sports suspension with tauter springing and damping including Sports Direct-Steer system for even more agile handling Air suspension
The Coupé comes with the option of AIRMATIC air suspension on the front and rear axle. Its electronically controlled, continuously adjustable damping on the front and rear axle ensures outstanding road roar and tyre vibration characteristics in every situation and gives the driver the option of selecting the desired driving style: sporty, comfortable or consumption-optimised. To this end, the driver can select one of five driving modes using the DYNAMIC SELECT Switch: ""ECO"", ""Comfort"", ""Sport"", ""Sport +"" and ""Individual"". Selecting ""Individual"" allows the driver to customise the vehicle settings. AIRMATIC also features all-round self-levelling for excellent ride comfort even with the vehicle loaded. Efficient and lively engines
Powerful and efficient four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines with ECO start\/stop function provide for sporty performance and driving pleasure. All are compliant with the Euro 6 emissions standard. Compared with the predecessor they consume up to 20 percent less fuel. There are initially four petrol engines available for the Coupé. The power spectrum ranges from the 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine in the C 180 with 115 kW\/156 hp to the two-litre C 200 (135 kW\/184 hp) and C 250 (155 kW\/211 hp) models and the C 300, likewise with a displacement of two litres but with an output of 180 kW\/245 hp. The two diesel models are equipped with an enhanced four-cylinder unit developing 125 kW (170 hp) or 150 kW (204 hp) and feature ecofriendly SCR technology (Selective Catalytic Reduction) for exhaust gas aftertreatment. Lighter, stiffer and stronger
Intelligent lightweight construction with a higher proportion of aluminium helps make the Coupé lighter than its predecessor. Light-alloy components include the wings, bonnet and boot lid. At the same time, the body is now much stiffer and stronger thanks to the use of high-strength materials, which has a positive effect on not only driving dynamics and noise levels but also crash safety. The Coupé therefore follows a Mercedes-Benz tradition in not only meeting all current national and international laws, but also all rating requirements as well as the more stringent internal Mercedes-Benz safety requirements, which are based on what actually happens in real-life accidents. Through the wind
Mercedes-Benz is setting the pace in the field of aerodynamics and delivers cars with the best drag coefficients (Cd values) in almost all vehicle classes. The new C‑Class Coupé boasts a Cd value of 0.26. This leading figure pays off above all when driving on country roads and motorways as wind resistance is greater than other forms of driving resistance at speeds above 70 km\/h. Safe semi-autonomous driving to reduce stress
There are several safety and assistance systems based on the Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive concept to choose from. ATTENTION ASSIST with adjustable sensitivity, which can warn the driver of inattentiveness and drowsiness, is included as standard. Further standard equipment includes COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS, which features an acoustic warning for the driver at speeds above 7 km\/h and Adaptive Brake Assist to help avoid collisions by boosting the braking effect in line with the current situation. When a danger of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to 200 km\/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles or, in the best-case scenario, even avoiding the collision altogether. At speeds of up to 50 km\/h the system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles, and is thus able to help prevent rear-end collisions at up to 40 km\/h. New assistance systems with substantially enhanced functions are optionally available, combining data from various sensor technologies such as radar sensors and a stereo camera as part of the Intelligent Drive concept to enhance comfort and safety:
DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot is an adaptive cruise control system that can adjust the speed of the vehicle in line with a slower-moving vehicle ahead in a speed range from 0 to 200 km\/h if required. Likewise available from 0 to 200 km\/h, steering intervention helps the driver stay in lane. And at speeds below 130 km\/h, for example in traffic jams or when driving bumper to bumper, the system can follow the vehicle ahead even where there are no or unclear lane markings, thus enabling the driver to safety and comfortably follow the flow of traffic. As well as vehicles ahead and stationary vehicles, the BAS PLUS Brake Assist System can also detect crossing traffic and boost the braking force if the driver fails to apply the brakes sufficiently; in addition to slower-moving, stopping and stationary vehicles, the PRE-SAFE® Brake can even detect pedestrians and brake autonomously if the driver fails to react, thus preventing accidents up to 50 km\/h and mitigating the severity of collisions at speeds of up to 72 km\/h. In flowing traffic the PRE-SAFE® Brake provides assistance according to the same mode of operation throughout the speed range from 7 to 200 km\/h. Enhanced Active Lane Keeping Assist can now also prevent the vehicle from unintentionally drifting out of lane by applying the brakes on one side when the lane markings are solid or broken and there is a risk of collision, e.g. as a result of vehicles overtaking at high speed, parallel traffic or even oncoming traffic. PRE-SAFE® PLUS extends the Intelligent Drive functions to take account of imminent rear impacts. It warns the following traffic by activating the rear hazard warning lights at increased frequency and initiating preventive PRE‑SAFE® occupant protection measures such as the reversible belt tensioner immediately prior to the impact. If the vehicle is stationary, the brakes are locked to reduce the forward jolt, which reduces the forces acting on the occupants and the risk of secondary collisions. The numerous assistance systems also include
Active Parking Assist, which enables semi-automated parking with active steering and brake intervention in both parallel and end-on parking spaces A 360° camera which is able to show the vehicle and its surroundings from various perspectives, including a virtual bird's-eye view, thus assisting with parking and manoeuvring Camera and navigation-based Traffic Sign Assist with wrong-way warning function, which warns of speed limits and also alerts the driver to the start and end of no-overtaking zones and gives the driver a visual and audible warning if no-entry signs are detected Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus, which allows the high-beam headlamps to be kept on permanently without dazzling traffic by masking out other vehicles in the cone of light from the high-beam headlamps Airbags for safety
In addition to 3-point seat belts with pyrotechnical belt tensioning and belt-force limitation for driver, front passenger and rear passengers, numerous airbags serve to protect the vehicle's occupants in an accident. These include:
Frontal protection systems: Adaptive front airbags for driver and front passenger, additionally with a kneebag on the driver's side Side protection systems: Thorax\/pelvisbags for driver and front passenger plus front and rear windowbags, with rear sidebags available as an option Climate control with satellite navigation
The air conditioning system in the new C-Class Coupé operates efficiently and ensures high air quality. As in the Saloon, it uses satellite navigation to detect tunnels. It therefore closes the air recirculation flap automatically when entering a tunnel and opens it again after exiting a tunnel. Vibrant infotainment experience
The new multimedia generation offers intuitive controls with visual animations and effects. Frontbass ensures a listening experience almost on a par with a concert hall – especially if the optionally available Burmester® sound system is specified. The Frontbass system uses the space within the cross-member and side member in the body structure as a resonance chamber for the bass speakers. The navigation system, which supplies the driver with precise traffic information in real time (Live Traffic Information), processes its contents interactively. Its features include an animated compass, a ""Drive Show"" with information for passengers similar to the on-screen presentations on board airliners and Google Maps displayed on the head unit. Extensive networking even in the basic version
A Bluetooth®-compatible mobile phone with data option is all it takes to make even the Audio 20 system internet-capable. This enables surfing the internet without restrictions when the vehicle is stationary. Mercedes-Benz Apps can be used while driving. Audio and video playback is possible from various sources. COMAND Online provides not only a larger display with a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels, it also allows digital TV\/radio reception and, in addition to many other features, offers fast hard-disc navigation, integral WLAN hotspot functionality and the LINGUATRONIC voice control system. The basic Audio 20 system as well as Audio 20 CD and COMAND Online all offer basic telephony as standard, which links up a mobile phone to the vehicle via a standardised Bluetooth® interface. Mercedes connect me: connected with the car
Like other models, the new C-Class Coupé has an extensive range of free Standard Services and Remote Online Services available as part of the ""Mercedes connect me"" package. Standard Services include automatic emergency call (eCall), Accident Recovery, breakdown assistance and after-sales service. The Remote Online services (standard with COMAND online and usable free of charge for the first three years) allow access to vehicle information at all times, including the status of windows and doors, mileage, tyre pressures and other diagnostic data. There is also a Vehicle Tracker function, remote door locking and unlocking, and remote auxiliary heating activation and deactivation.. 2016 Mercedes-AMG G63 463 Edition Review. Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The death of John Lennon, premiere of Star Wars Episode V, first Rubik’s Cube, first 24 hour news station, and the Mercedes-Benz G Class. 1980 was a big year in history, when gurning ear-to-ear picking up speed on the Autobahn slip road, it was difficult to comprehend that the G Class is now 35-years old. Roll your eyes over the plush upholstered dash and the differential switches and your sight is filled with the boxy hood punctuated by the two jaunty indicators that mark out the vast dimension that stretch out ahead of you. Pan left and right and you are reminded of the flat rectangles of glass that would be more at home in your oven door than any modern-day car window as would the passenger handle. Yes, it may well we based on a 35-year-old car, but the 2016 G Class still manages to impress time and again. Flashback onto the Autobahn slip road, our cheeks our already aching from a mornings grinning. We are sat high in the G63 AMG 463 Edition, and it may well be one of the most emotional and entertaining cars we have ever driven. In a world of downsizing, eco-boosting and emissions, the entire character of this car is dominated by one thing, the hand-built AMG 5.5-litre V8. The 463 Edition had a power boost from the standard G63s 537 brake horsepower to now produce a scarcely believable 563 brake horsepower accompanied with what is possibly the best sound made by any V8. The power is all corrupting, menacing and gives you a fix unobtainable without dabbling with illegal substances. The endless power and all-wheel-drive system will catapult the G63 to 100 km\/h in 5.4 seconds, impressive given the 2550 kilogram mass that is being shifted. Depress the go faster pedal and you expect to pick up speed in a quick way considering the performance figures, but the acceleration is nothing less than savage. From just 1,500-5,000 rpm there are 500 pound-feet of torques that launch you along the tarmac at an alarming rate. It is an almost surreal experience, the windscreen glass is so raked and is so close to your face that you fear the bugs that violently splatter as red dots will instead forever been lodged in your smiling cheeks. As you press on you can hear the wind having it force its way around the thick metal frame as you approach the limited top speed of a modest 210 km\/h (130 mph) but your ears are first assaulted by the glorious sound of the biturbo V8 burbling and fluttering. As the revs build and the turbos spool, the sound becomes more aggressive and angry with the cabin being filled with the melodious cacophony as a cathedral is from a grand organ. The blare as you approach the redline is almost scary but endlessly entertaining. The noise, courtesy of the desperately cool side pipes, is fantastic and is one aspect of the G63 AMG that will make you miss the beast whenever you surrender the keys. Pull off the Autobahn and find some quieter roads to fill with the V8 roar, show the G Class a few bends and once more you will be surprised. When you consider the G63 AMG tips the scales at a mammoth 2.5 tonnes you adapt your driving style. Initially we approached faster corners very gingerly in an attempt to not embarrass ourselves calling Mercedes-Benz and apologising for flipping their shiny new 463 Edition G63 on its side. Having felt the strength of the brakes and surprisingly controlled chassis balance, any fears of toppling the G Wagon subsided. Barreling into sharper bends was a little unnerving as the steering rack was snail slow, arm fulls of lock were necessary and any weight or feedback was absent. Then you remember that this car is capable of wading through rivers, effortlessly climbing large rocks and barely acknowledges the existence of mud and snow and you forgive its inability to corner as flat and composed as a Ferrari 458 Speciale. Back off a little and the G63 AMG rewards you with its soundtrack, comfort and great visibility. Back in the city the magnitude of just how cool the G63 in 463 Edition guise looks is clear. Even in the rain hordes of people stop walking and draw from their smartphones. At low speeds the raspy exhaust note burbles away unashamedly, cars in traffic around the car point at the beautiful wheels and stripe the instantly reminded us of the gorgeous C63 507 Edition that we so miss. At traffic lights we were constantly smiled at and told to make some noise, something that the G63 obliged to do much to the delight of fellow road users. As we reached our rendezvous point we stopped for a few quick photographs and were approached by two police men, holsters filled with intimidating firearms, but all the officers brandished were smiles and questions about the German machine. They took a look inside and we talked them through the additions that come courtesy of the 463 Edition package. The cabin in beautifully crafted, every material from the carbon fibre switch surrounds to the contrast two-tone seats are made from the highest quality materials. The interior space is very generous, as you would expect from a car of such size. The Mercedes-AMG G63 AMG 463 Edition is a car that many will question, a car of such size with so much power combined with a design that is 35 years of age is not easy to comprehend. That is the beauty of this car. It is an incredible boulevard cruiser, G Wagons are found in Los Angeles, across to every major city in Europe and even as far as Japan and for good reason. We expect more of the ultra rich and famous to indulge in the 463 Edition G63 that costs €160,000 a small premium over the standard car, a justified price hike in our minds. This is not a car you purchase for rational reasons, its big, thirsty and is not the easiest car to live with, but every single time you get behind the wheel those thoughts are banished and overwhelmed by the joy, character and the sheer entertainment of the buzzing power and brutality of the V8 combined with what could be one of the coolest and most iconic designs of all time. It is something that you can only fathom when you experience it in first hand as we have had the pleasure of doing on more than one occasion. Happy birthday G Wagon, we wish you many more years of fun, pleasure and enjoyment. REVIEW OVERVIEW

In its 43-year history, the S-Class has evolved into one of the world’s best-selling luxury models . That kind of success has spurred numerous body types over the years, including a cabriolet version that’s now ready for its own next-generation debut. It will happen at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show , where Mercedes will introduce the drop-top version of the sixth-gen S-Class.
Although it brings infinite headroom to Stuttgart’s sixth generation of range-topping luxury cars, the new S-Class Convertible is actually the first drop-top to wear the S-Class badge and the first open-top luxury four-seater from Mercedes-Benz since 1971. The W108, built between 1965 and 1972, was the first and final luxury four-seater to have a retractable top
Once it’s out, the S-Class Cabriolet should be a strong competitor against the likes of the 2016 Bentley Continental GT Convertible and the 2015 Aston Martin DB9 Volante . Will it have what it takes to give its British rivals a run for the their money? Find out in our review.
Updated 09\/02\/2015: Mercedes dropped the official details on the new S-Class Convertible, with just a few days before its official debut in Frankfurt.

The S-Class Convertible is identical to its coupe sibling below the beltline, which makes it a gorgeous cabriolet to look at. It comes with the same aggressive yet still elegant front fascia, sleek rear end with slender taillights, muscular engine hood, and strong character lines between the front and rear wheel arches. It’s above the beltline where the S-Class Convertible differs significantly, thanks to its canvas roof.
Though it’s not as sleek as the coupe with the top up, particularly because of the smaller quarter windows and the not-so-smooth shape of the soft-top as it descends toward the rear, the S-Class Convertible is downright handsome with the top folded behind the seats. It’s not as bulky as the Bentley Continental GT Convertible and not as aggressive as the DB9 Volante. Its designed seems perfectly balanced, blending the gracefulness of its 1970s ancestor with Mercedes’ sleeker styling language of 2015.Interior
As expected, the drop-top’s cabin mirrors the coupe’s. The same single-unit dashboard is awash in fine leather and dominated by five retro-styled air-conditioning vents. You’ll also find the same single block display unit that extends from the driver’s side door all the way to the center console. The soft sculpted bucket seats also make their appearance in the S-Class Convertible, as is the optional red full-leather upholstery.
But the cabrio does come with additional standard equipment, including the company’s Air-Scarf neck heater and draft-reducing electric wind deflectors. There’s also a new Thermotronic climate control system that uses sensors and actuators to maintain the temperature when the roof is folded. This feature can also detect the presence of harmful gases entering the cabin.
Then there’s the retractable roof, which, unsurprisingly, is state-of-the-art technology. It uses a three-layer, acoustically optimized design with an outer fabric cover that incorporates a butyl layer acting as a water barrier. The top can be dropped or raised in under 20 seconds and at speeds of 37 mph. when the soft-top is opened, it folds away into the trunk, where it is separated from the remaining luggage compartment space by means of an electrically operated retractable cover which encloses the roof. When the soft-top is up, the luggage compartment partition can be retracted by pressing a button in the inner paneling of the boot lid to increase luggage space.Drivetrain
Not surprisingly, the S-Class Cabriolet, available only in S500 trim, is powered by the same engine as the coupe. That’s a biturbo, 4.7-liter V-8 producing 455 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque, linked to a 9G-Tronic nine-speed automatic transmission and the brand’s 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. Performance figures aren’t yet available, but the coupe should be able to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds, making it a tenth-second slower than the coupe. Top speed is likely limited at a very German 155 mph.Drivetrain Specifications

As with most luxury models from Mercedes-Benz, the S-Class Convertible is packed with assistance and safety systems. These include Pre-Safe Brake with pedestrian detection, Distronic Plus with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot, Brake Assist BAS Plus with Cross‑Traffic Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus, and Night View Assist Plus.Prices
The arrival of the S-Class Cabriolet would put the array of body-styles of Mercedes flagship model up to six. The existing coupe is already there, as are the four wheelbase lengths of the sedan. Pricing for the cabrio has yet to be announced, but we expect it to be a little more than the $121,550 starting price of the coupe version. My best guess would be a sticker of around $135,000.CompetitorsBentley Continental GT Convertible When the Mercedes S-Class Convertible hits dealerships, it’s going to find itself competing against an exclusive list of vehicles that are no slouches in their own right. One such model is the Bentley Continental GT Convertible, considered one of the standard-bearers of this select group. Typical of Bentley , the Continental GTC looks outlandishly elegant that also shows glimpses of being sporty and muscular.
Bentley also made tweaks to the car’s 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 engine, bumping the output up to 582 horsepower and 531 pound-feet of torque for the 2016 model. The addition of cylinder deactivation also cuts fuel consumption by five percent, which is a huge deal for an engine that does a combined 20 mpg. The Continental GT Convertible does have one huge drawback compared to the S-Class Convertible: price. Whereas the Merc is expected to a little over $130,000, the Continental GT Convertible has a staggering starting price of $266,485. So the question is: if you’re in the market for a luxury convertible, would you rather buy one Bentley Continental GT Convertible or two Mercedes S-Class Cabriolets?
Read more about the 2016 Bentley Continental GT Convertible here .Aston Martin DB9 Volante The Aston Martin DB9 Volante shares a few characteristics with the Bentley Continental GT Convertible, not the least of which is a price tag that eclipses $200,000. The S-Class Cabriolet doesn’t approach that by a mile, but all that should change when the boys from AMG turn up the heat with the expected release of the cabriolet versions of the S63 AMG and S65 AMG.
The DB9 Volante suffers from the same problem that seem to befall a lot of Aston Martin models. Ever since its introduction in 2004, the DB9 Volante hasn’t changed all that much. Sure, it was ground-breaking back then, but that was also a time wherein Facebook was still in its infancy and Twitter hadn’t even been invented yet. Times have changed but sadly, Aston Martin seems to have gotten stuck in the mud on that end.
That’s not to say that the DB9 Volante looks dated. On the contrary, Aston Martin has done a remarkable job keeping its models interesting despite not having done any wholesale changes to it. Powering the DB9 Volante is a 6.0-liter V-12 engine that pumps out 500 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque. That’s a little more than what the standard S-Class Cabtriolet is capable of. The DB9 Volante starts out at $205,325.
Read our review of the 2016 Aston Martin DB9 Volante by Q here .Conclusion
Mercedes’ reinvention at the top of its range continues with the arrival of the 2016 S-Class Cabriolet. The base iteration will be heavily outgunned by some of the powers of this case, but reinforcements are expected to arrive when the AMGs join in on the fun. For now, though, the S-Class Cabriolet will stand as the flagship Mercedes convertible once it hits dealerships in early 2016. For what it has, it’s more than capable of taking the fight to the competition, at least until the cavalry arrives.

Press Release
The new Cabriolet is the sixth variant of the current S-Class family and the first open-top luxury four-seater from Mercedes-Benz since 1971. It offers a distinctive, sensual and exclusive design, the cutting-edge technology of the S-Class and a comprehensive warmth and wind protection concept which includes intelligent climate control for convertibles. The elegantly sporty model will have its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in September.
Also on show in Frankfurt will be a superlative dream car from Mercedes‑AMG in the guise of the S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet. Its 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine offers an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and peak torque of 900 Nm, AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split as standard and acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds.
""After 44 years we are once again able to offer Mercedes aficionados an open-top car in the S-Class. The new S-Class Cabriolet symbolises our passion for individual and timelessly exclusive mobility, which we share with our customers"", remarks Ola Källenius, Board Member of Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales.
The new S-Class Cabriolet is exceptionally rigid. Innovative solutions such as the luggage compartment bulkhead made of aluminium and magnesium as well as the aluminium rear floor also lower the bodyshell weight to the level of the S-Class Coupé. The standard-fit roll-over protection system behind the rear head restraints features pyrotechnic initiation of the actuators for the first time, in addition to which the roll bars themselves are moved into position by a gas generator.
""Two years after its launch, the S-Class family is now complete. We have never offered six models in the luxury class before - and never before have we enjoyed such success"", says Prof. Dr Thomas Weber, Member of the Daimler Board of Management responsible for Group Research and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. ""The S-Class sets the pace on the global market when it comes to safety, efficiency and comfort.""
Mercedes-Benz lays claim to building the world’s most comfortable convertible. When it comes to climate comfort, the enhanced automatic wind protection system AIRCAP, the AIRSCARF neck-level heating system, the heated armrests, the seat heating also in the rear plus the intelligent climate control ensure that this is indeed the case. In contrast to conventional systems, the climate is controlled fully automatically. This means that the driver does not need to select a mode for closed or open top, nor is it necessary to save a temperature setting for these driving conditions.
A loving attention to detail is also evident in the luggage compartment concept: when the soft top is opened, it folds away into part of the luggage compartment. The soft top is separated from the remaining luggage compartment space by means of an electrically operated retractable cover which encloses the soft top. This luggage compartment partition extends automatically during opening of the soft top. This means that the driver no longer needs to stop in order to operate the luggage compartment cover manually, providing for added convenience. The partition will not be activated if the luggage compartment is loaded such that there are objects in the area of the partition. When the soft top is closed, the luggage compartment partition can be retracted by pressing a button in the inner panelling of the boot lid, so as to increase the available luggage space.
Additional boons are standard-specification electro-hydraulic remote locking for the luggage compartment and a through-loading facility into the interior.
Dynamic profile, superlative class: The design
""With its sensual and pure design idiom, our new S-Class Cabriolet is one of the most beautiful and exclusive S-Class cars of all time,"" says Gorden Wagener, Head of Design at Daimler AG. ""It embodies modern luxury in a very special way and is an expression of both effortless superiority and progressivity.""
The centrepiece of the front end is the black diamond radiator grille featuring the Mercedes star and a single louvre in silver with chrome inserts. The bonnet adds dynamic touches with two powerful character lines. The striking front bumper incorporates large air intakes in the middle and at the sides. The chrome trim adds a sporty finishing touch to the front end. The optional LED Intelligent Light System showcases the car’s elegance in glittering style with exquisite Swarovski crystals for the direction indicators and daytime running lamps.
The side design of the S-Class Cabrio presents a thrilling dynamic coupé-style profile when the soft top is closed. Features of the side design include a low greenhouse, the dropping line of the side wall descending towards the rear and the fully retractable side windows. The multilayer, taut soft top underscores the vehicle’s class when closed. The soft top is available in black, dark blue, beige and dark red.
The switch in the centre console can be used to open and close the soft top while on the move up to a speed of 60 km\/h. Opening and closing take around 20 seconds. The soft top is deposited above the automatically extending luggage compartment partition. The newly developed soft top from Mercedes Benz is a tensioning-arm top. When closing the soft top, the required closing forces are generated by moving the tensioning arms beyond the dead centre position – a process known as ’overcentering’. This avoids the need for any additional closures on the soft top compartment lid, in keeping with the high design quality embodied by the S-Class Cabrio. With the electronic key, opening and closing are also possible from outside the vehicle.
The rear end underscores the impression of width with flat LED tail lights and muscular shoulders. The closed soft top with glass window blends harmoniously into the rear view. The soft top compartment lid is framed by a wide chrome trim element. The rear bumper with diffusor-look lower section, two visible tailpipe trims and a horizontal chrome trim element add a sporty finish. The Mercedes star is hinged and performs several functions: it serves as a handle for manual opening of the boot lid and is also the cover for the reversing camera and the 360° camera (optional).
Inside, the S-Class Cabriolet boasts a luxuriously sporty design idiom and fine materials, conjuring up an exceptionally classy interior setting. The soft top opens up to create an open-air lounge that exudes a yacht-like atmosphere. The carefully matched choice of colours and materials and the high-quality controls in real metal or in chrome look underscore the vehicle’s highly exclusive character. To enable the broadest scope for individualisation, there is a choice of leather, nappa leather or designo Exclusive nappa leather plus six different interior colour concepts, including a maritime-inspired combination of deep-sea blue and porcelain. The materials feature the highest standard of workmanship and are hand-crafted in character.
Exemplary low wind noise
With a Cd value of 0.29, aerodynamics world champion Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark in this segment with the S-Class Cabrio. The excellent air flow characteristics are attributable, for example, to the underbody panelling concept with extensive engine compartment and main floor panelling, the extensive rear axle cladding, the aerodynamically optimised wheel spoilers, the aerodynamic shape of the exterior mirrors and the well-balanced power split between front and rear axle.
As a worthy sister model for the S-Class Coupé – the series production car with the quietest interior of all – the open four-seater offers excellent noise-related comfort, too. A three-layer acoustic soft top comes as standard. The outer fabric cover incorporates a butyl layer as a water barrier on the inside, as opposed to the previous neoprene layer. This lowers noise levels, as does the enhanced upholstery matting and the acoustically optimised roof lining. The insulating layer also ensures that the elegant profile silhouette is not spoiled by bows that are visible from the outside.
Bodyshell measures, the sealing concept for the doors and the double glazing are also crucial to the low wind noise level in the interior. In addition to noise-related comfort, the aerodynamics engineers have also devoted special attention to maintaining a draught-free interior. The new S-Class Cabrio is optionally available with the AIRCAP automatic wind protection system. This can be extended at the touch of a button to reduce turbulence in the interior. AIRCAP consists of two components: a wind deflector with a net, set into the roof frame, that can be extended by seven centimetres, plus a similarly extendable draught-stop behind the rear seats, with a convex contour and stainless steel trim. The innovative diffusor ribs on the bottom edge of the front louvre are a further development. They produce specific turbulence effects to reduce the noise level. The wind deflector is finished in the body colour on the S-Class Cabrio.
Another optionally available feature is the AIRSCARF neck-level heating. This extends the convertible season by enabling comfortable open-top driving even at low outside temperatures. With this patented neck-level heating system, warmed air circulates around the head and neck areas of the occupants from the head restraints.
THERMOTRONIC: particularly intelligent climate control
The new S-Class premieres an intelligent climate control system which in future will provide for ideal climate comfort coupled with maximum user-friendliness in all open-top vehicles from Mercedes-Benz. The air conditioning experts at Mercedes‑Benz developed a new software architecture specifically for this system, which underwent rigorous testing on state-of-the-art ""hardware-in-the-loop"" test stands prior to fine-tuning in the climate tunnel and on test drives.
In contrast to conventional systems, the climate is controlled fully automatically. This means that the driver does not need to select a mode for closed or open top, nor is it necessary to save a temperature setting for these driving conditions. An overlapping function performs the considerable feat of achieving an unnoticeable transition between closed and open top (and vice-versa) for maximum climate comfort. The Cabrio benefits here from the sophisticated climate control concept for the S-Class, which enables automatic individual control of each nozzle, for example.
The air conditioning control unit is fully networked and communicates with numerous vehicle components. In all, 12 sensors and 18 actuators provide for an ideal climate in all conditions. In addition to interior and exterior temperature, the sensors also detect the level of solar radiation. A sensor for air quality and harmful gases constantly monitors the quality of the outside air being drawn in. To effectively prevent the windows from fogging up, a dewpoint sensor measures the absolute humidity on the front windscreen. Two solar sensors on the dashboard and on the rear shelf ensure that blower level and temperature are adjusted to the selected settings in good time in response to any changes in solar irradiation.
With two climate zones and three climate styles (diffuse, medium or focused), the standard-fit THERMOTRONIC automatic climate control system enables an individual feel-good climate on board. Driver and front passenger are able to control the temperature, airflow and air distribution and to vary the temperature of their footwells in five levels, independently of each other. The status of the soft top influences air distribution, blower operation and temperature control. The new THERMOTRONIC with intelligent climate control follows the Mercedes-Benz philosophy of supplying cold air quickly after starting up the vehicle and subsequently controlling the climate as inconspicuously as possible.
The optionally available Warmth Comfort package provides for even cosier warm conditions. The armrests on the centre console and the doors as well as the multifunction steering wheel can be heated in addition to the seats. Driver and front passenger can choose between three different heating levels at the touch of a button. The AIR-BALANCE package, featuring fragrancing and ionisation as well as additional air cleaning by activated charcoal filter, is also available. PACIFIC MOOD is a new fragrance which is available exclusively for the Cabriolet.
Drive, suspension, active safety: a fully-fledged member of the S-Class family
The V8 engine of the S 500 Cabrio has an output of 335 kW (455 hp). The displacement stands at 4663 cc and the engine produces peak torque of 700 Nm from 1800 rpm. In NEDC combined mode the Cabrio gets by on 8.5 litres of premium-grade petrol per 100 km, with CO2 emissions of 199 g\/km. The innovative 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission supports both a dynamic and a fuel-saving driving style.
The S-Class Cabrio is fitted as standard with the full-support AIRMATIC semi-active air suspension featuring infinitely variable damping control. This system sets standards with respect to road roar and handling stability. It can be set to a sportier or more comfort-oriented mode, according to personal tastes. The four-link front axle impresses with a high level of driving comfort, plus precise suspension action.
Like the S-Class Saloon and Coupé, the new Cabrio is available with numerous new assistance systems that make driving even more comfortable and safer. Intelligent Drive systems include PRE-SAFE® Brake with pedestrian detection, DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot, Brake Assist BAS PLUS with Cross‑Traffic Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus and Night View Assist Plus. In addition to a distance and collision warning function in conjunction with Adaptive Brake Assist, which offers collision protection from speeds as low as 7 km\/h, the COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS system installed in even the standard vehicle also features an additional function: when a danger of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to more than 100 km\/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles. At speeds of up to around 50 km\/h the system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles, and is able to prevent rear-end collisions at up to around 40 km\/h.
The PRE-SAFE® preventive occupant protection system has been upgraded to PRE‑SAFE® PLUS. PRE-SAFE® PLUS can recognise an imminent rear-end collision and warn following traffic by flashing the rear hazard warning lights at a high frequency. When a danger of collision persists, the system can ""lock"" the brakes of the stationary vehicle prior to a rear-end collision and activate the PRE-SAFE® belt tensioners immediately before impact. This action minimises the risk of whiplash injury by reducing the forwards jolt caused by the impact and ensuring that the occupants are in the best possible position.
Intelligent lightweight design: extremely rigid, remarkably light
As the sixth variant of the current S-Class, the new S-Class Cabriolet (length\/width\/height: 5027\/1899\/1417 mm) is a member of the world’s largest luxury model family. Its closest relative is the S-Class Coupé, from which the Cabrio adopts around 60 percent of its bodyshell components. A completely new feature is the rear floor, produced in aluminium for the first time. This raises the share of this lightweight metal in terms of surface area to over 50 percent in the overall intelligent mix of materials.
Striking new components are the longitudinal members in die-cast aluminium, based on a technology which was developed for the current SL. With the aid of a sand core, the longitudinal member is produced as a closed cast body which is hollow inside. This enables various components to be integrated in the longitudinal member, while also making varying wall thicknesses possible. This means a functionally ideal and weight-optimised design for the longitudinal member. In order to attain the high functional objectives (noise, vibration, durability and crash characteristics), the multifunction well (previously: spare wheel well) is welded in place in the bodyshell.
Another noticeable new feature is the rear wall behind the rear seats, which serves to reinforce the body while at the same time supporting the pyrotechnically extending roll bars and also incorporating a through-loading opening into the luggage compartment. This rear wall consists of aluminium sections whose characteristic shape has earned this component the internal nickname ""hockey goal"". Two shear panels, in the form of the magnesium rear wall and a cover consisting of aluminium sections, assure this assembly of high rigidity. The rear wall is attached via two additional large cast aluminium parts to the side wall. There are also numerous reinforcements on the underfloor to enhance the four-seater convertible’s rigidity.
In all, the body engineers have achieved two essentially contradictory aims: in terms of torsional stiffness, the S-Class Cabrio even attains values on a par with those of the S-Class Coupé which was superseded last year, while at the same time the bodyshell weight of the current closed sister model has been maintained. The weight-saving measures also include ingenious solutions such as the vibration absorber which the hydraulic pump of the automatic soft top uses as additional weight, thereby saving around 7 kg.
Standard-fit roll over protection system: Fully pyrotechnic
On detecting an impending danger of the vehicle rolling over, the airbag control unit sends a corresponding signal to the roll over protection system. This is quickly extended behind the rear head restraints, helping to maintain a safe passenger compartment. The roll bars are extended not by spring force, but – for the first time on a Mercedes-Benz – by pyrotechnical means, using a gas generator.
This is made possible by state-of-the-art yaw rate sensors which, in contrast to the previously employed tilting cone sensors, virtually rule out incorrect actuation. In keeping with the S-Class Cabriolet’s high design quality, there are no tear lines in the panelling behind the rear head restraints.
Heritage: coveted dream cars of the 1960s
The new S-Class Cabriolet is carrying the long and successful tradition of Mercedes-Benz luxury-segment cabriolets into the future. Even back in the 1920s the luxury cabriolets from Stuttgart combined the freedom of open-top motoring with the comfort and safety of a Mercedes-Benz Saloon. From the start of post-war production the top models from Mercedes-Benz were also available in the particularly exclusive variant as a cabriolet. These included the 170 S (W 136) from 1949, the 220 (W 187) from 1951 and the 300 S (W 188) from 1952.
After the ""Ponton"" cabriolets 220 S (W 180) and 220 SE (W 128) built from 1956 to 1960, in 1961 the 220 SE Cabriolet of the model series W 111 was launched, a particularly elegant, open-top four-seater, whose design is still considered timeless to this day.
In this ten-year production period Mercedes-Benz offered five different models in these model series: the 220 SE, 250 SE, 300 SE (W 112), 280 SE and, as a late top model, the eight-cylinder 280 SE 3.5 – in total 7013 units of these five cabriolets were manufactured in Sindelfingen. For the time being there was no open-top luxury-segment car in the Mercedes-Benz model range to follow this generation: rather, it is the new SL from model series 107 from 1971 onwards which cultivated the tradition of open-top motoring in the Stuttgart brand’s cars – as a two-seater.
The cabriolets from Mercedes-Benz are today amongst the most sought-after classic cars - and the prices have developed accordingly. Examples of this are the Cabriolets from model series 111 the values of which are cited by the renowned American Hagerty Insurance’s price guide. In its estimation a 280 SE 3.5 from the final year of construction, 1971, in condition 2 today has a value of around 290,000 US$ - ten years ago the figure was some 115,000 US$. But that is by no means the pinnacle: for instance, a specimen of this model in excellent condition was auctioned last August by RM Auctions for 429,000 US$.
The last six-cylinder 280 SE model (1969) in the same condition is valued today by Hagerty at approx. 75,000 US$ - about 45,000 US$ ten years ago. Early 220 SE models are around the same level, with a current value of some 84,000 US$.

SOURCE  car2go N.A. LLC. Mercedes-Benz G Wagon G-Class G 500. All Mercedes-Benz G-Class models now offer up to 16 percent more power and up to 17 percent lower fuel consumption. The range includes the G 500 with a new, powerful 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine. All engines are compliant with the latest Euro 6 emissions standard. A new suspension setup together with more sensitive ESP ® control results in increased driving stability, safety and road comfort. The exterior and interior have also been given an upgrade. The exclusive AMG EDITION 463 and the G 500 4×4 2 are also being launched. 
 

 
Mercedes-Benz’s classic off-roader is beginning a new chapter in a success story that spans more than 35 years. With its continuously improved technology and high-class equipment specification, this all-terrain icon has consistently satisfied the highest expectations of off-road fans. True to this tradition, a new 4.0-litre directly injected V8 biturbo engine is now celebrating its world premiere in the G‑Class. 
 
8-cylinder biturbo developed by Mercedes-AMG 
 
The new 8-cylinder powerplant in the G 500 can point to an exclusive heritage. It is based on the new generation of V8 engines developed by Mercedes-AMG that have already coaxed exceptional levels of performance out of the Mercedes-AMG GT and Mercedes-AMG C 63. For use in the G-Class, the V8 has been modified to deliver 310 kW (422 hp) with torque of 610 Nm. Other standout attributes include a spontaneous response and high tractive power 
 
made possible, for example, by two turbochargers, which instead of being configured on the outside of the cylinder banks, are arranged between them in the V – the so-called “hot inside V”. This layout allows a compact design, optimal response and low exhaust emissions. High efficiency is ensured by Mercedes‑Benz’s use of piezo direct petrol injection with spray-guided combustion. Maximum strength with lowest possible weight is guaranteed by the aluminium crankcase of the V8 engine. The cylinder bore surfaces feature Daimler’s NANOSLIDE ® technology, which makes them twice as hard as conventional cast-iron liners. This minimises both internal friction and fuel demand. 
 
Technical data of the G 500 
    Cylinders  V8    Cylinder angle  90 degrees    Valves per cylinder  4    Displacement  3982 cc    Bore x stroke  83.0 x 92.0 mm    Cylinder spacing  90 mm    Compression ratio  10.5:1    Output  310 kW (422 hp) at 5250 to 5500 rpm    Torque  610 Nm at 2250 to 4750 rpm     
Compared with the previous 5.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 unit, the new 8-cylinder biturbo engine puts out 25 kW (35 hp) more power and 80 newton metres more torque. Turbocharging results in maximum power and torque being delivered at lower engine speeds, this being to the benefit of not just tractive power and performance, but also fuel economy. The new G 500 accelerates to 100 km\/h in 5.9 seconds (previously: 6.1 seconds) and has a combined NEDC consumption of 12.3 litres per 100 kilometres (previously: 14.9 l\/100 km). 
 
More power, lower fuel consumption 
 
The engines in the other G-Class models have likewise been upgraded: 
  the G 350 d benefits from a hike in output from 155 kW (211 hp) to 180 kW (245 hp), with its torque climbing from 540 to 600 Nm. The G 350 d now accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 8.8 seconds instead of the previous 9.1 seconds. The combined NEDC consumption drops from 11.2 litres per 100 kilometres to 9.9 l\/100 km.  The AMG G 63 now delivers 420 kW (571 hp) instead of 400 kW (544 hp) with torque of 760 Nm.  Instead of 450 kW (612 hp), the 12-cylinder powerplant in the AMG G 65 now puts out 463 kW (630 hp) with torque of 1000 Nm.   
The G 350 d, G 500 and AMG G 63 are equipped as standard with an ECO start\/stop function that reduces fuel consumption and emissions by switching off the engine when the vehicle is at rest, e.g. in a traffic jam or at traffic lights. 
 
As is typical of the G-Class, the new models retain the familiar sturdy basis of body and ladder-type frame, which still offers generous reserves to cope with the increased power. Also retained is the unrivalled off-road performance with permanent all-wheel drive, low-range gearbox and three differential locks that can be engaged\/disengaged while on the move. 
 
Optimised ESP ® , optionally available adaptive damping system for G 500 
 
The standard suspension setup has been revised with optimised shock absorbers for improved control of body movements and even greater on-road ride comfort. An adapted ESP ® setup makes enhanced driving dynamics possible and, as a result, increased driving stability and road safety. Optimisations to ASR and ABS result in improved traction while shortening the stopping distance when braking. The front-axle load capacity has been raised by 100 kg to 1550 kg. 
 
In addition, the G 500 is optionally available with a new adaptive damping system with Sport and Comfort modes. This provides a significantly more agile on-road performance in Sport mode with undiminished off-road capability while at the same time reducing the typical SUV roll in corners. As already familiar from the AMG variants, the 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission in the G 350 d and G 500 models now also features a manual transmission mode. This mode, which can be conveniently activated by pressing the “M” button, allows the driver to savour the high available torque and to use the steering-wheel shift paddles to decide just when to change gear. 
 
Enhanced inside and out 
 
Visually, the new G 350 d and G 500 models are especially easy to identify by their restyled bumpers and now standard flared wheel arches in the vehicle colour. The G 350 d now also comes as standard with 45.7 cm (18-inch) five-spoke light-alloy wheels. 
 
On the inside, the G 350 d and G 500 feature an eye-catching instrument cluster in two-tube look with 11.4 cm multifunction display and redesigned pointers and dials. The two AMG models, too, sport a redesigned instrument cluster. 
 
New choice of colours 
 
A new Colour package is available for customers wishing to give their AMG G-Class an even more personal look. There are exclusive exterior paint finishes in solar beam, tomato red, alien green, sunset beam and galactic beam. Detachable parts such as mirrors, front and rear bumpers, wheel arch extensions, the ring around the spare wheel cover as well as the roof are painted in obsidian black. The interior topstitching is colour-matched to the paintwork. 
 
New AMG EDITION 463 special model: visible dynamics 
 
With the new EDITION 463 special model, Mercedes-AMG is giving the G 63 and G 65 an impressive sporty look. The exquisite interior specification includes a two-tone instrument panel, two-tone seats in high-quality designo leather with side bolsters in carbon-look leather and contrasting topstitching, seat and door centre panels in a diamond look, carbon-fibre trim and door pulls in nappa leather. 
 
On the outside, a stainless steel underguard, AMG sport stripes along the sides and a protective-strip insert in black aluminium look underscore both the dynamics and exclusivity of the special model. The G 63 is fitted with exclusive 53.3 cm (21-inch) 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels in matt black with high-sheen spokes and 295\/40 R 21 wide-base tyres. The G 65 has an exquisite look with identically sized, ceramically polished 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels. 
 
The Mercedes-Benz G 500 4×4 2 goes into series production 
 
Having proved hugely popular with many customers, the G 500 4×4 2 show car is set to enter series production. In the superlative-studded history of the G-Class, the G 500 4×4 2 is the new highlight in the model range. The technical package consists of the all-wheel-drive powertrain including portal axles and the new 4-litre V8 twin-turbo engine with an output of 310 kW (422 hp). 
 
Also new is the chassis with dual spring\/damper struts and adjustable damping. In the interior of the G 500 4×4 2 , occupants enjoy comfort and an ambience on a par with a luxury saloon. In view of the key data for the chassis and powertrain, it seems more than logical that the off-road world starts for the G 500 4×4 2 where other vehicles give up. The new “G” also puts in an absolutely convincing performance on the asphalt. Owing to the considerably wider track of the portal axles compared with the series-production car (+264 mm), the large 22-inch 325\/55 R 22-sized wheels and the adjustable damping with its Sport mode, the enhanced G-Class drives through bends so dynamically that the occupants feel as though they are in a sports car rather than a cross-country vehicle. This also applies to outings on unsurfaced slopes or snow-bound roads, in which case the performance of a high-powered rally car kicks in. 
 
The G 500 4×4 2 will be in Mercedes-Benz dealer showrooms from December 2015, with all other new G-Class models being available from September 2015.

The post appeared first on Car Shows .. Daimler AG categorically denies any and all allegations of manipulation. STUTTGART, Germany, Sept. 25, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- In light of the ongoing assertions from the Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a non-government organisation, and the related speculation, Daimler AG once again clearly states that: 

We categorically deny the accusation of manipulating emission tests regarding our vehicles. A defeat device, a function which illegitimately reduces emissions during testing, has never been and will never be used at Daimler. This holds true for both diesel and petrol engines. Our engines meet and adhere to every legal requirement. 

In light of the written request by the DUH, which was sent to us this morning with a deadline to respond by 3:00 pm (CET), and the seven questions they posed, we can confirm that none of the allegations apply to our vehicles. The technical programming of our engines adheres to all legal requirements. 

We have no knowledge of measurements that indicate our vehicles did not meet legally required standards. 

We actively support the work being done within Europe and Germany in order to develop new testing methods which measure emissions based on real driving conditions. 

We work closely and constructively with the responsible authorities in Germany, Europe and the United States and will willingly provide any vehicle for testing. 

We'd like to point out that we are evaluating our legal options pertaining to the approach taken and the public assertions made by the DUH.

Syndicated stories and blog feeds, all rights reserved by the author.. Will You Even Recognize Your Car in the Near Future?. In the 1973 film, ""Sleeper,"" Woody Allen is revived after being frozen following a botched operation. To escape the inept police state trying to terminate him, he steals a car that looks like a bubble, with frosted windows and no steering wheel. He simply tells it where to go. 
 
The comedy was supposed to take place 200 years from now but, at least when it comes to the car, it could just as well happen in little more than a decade from now. A recent concept vehicle from Mercedes-Benz, the F 015, can black out its windows, use voice commands to safely drive automatically to a destination, and passengers can swivel their seats to turn the big sedan into a mobile living room. 
     
 The Mercedes-Benz F015 Luxury in Motion autonomous concept car is pictured on-stage during the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada January 5, 2015.  STEVE MARCUS \/ Reuters 
  
At least, that's the grand vision - but it's creating nightmares for an auto industry facing tough new mileage, emissions and safety regulations and the need to invest tens of billions of dollars in new and largely untested technologies. And traditional automakers face the threat of new and well-funded challengers, such as Tesla, Google and Apple. 
 
""We all have a challenge now, the whole industry, imagining what the car will be like five or 10 years down the road,"" said Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of the Renault\/Nissan Alliance, during a roundtable discussion at the Frankfurt Motor Show earlier this week. 
 
There are a lot of things, he stressed, that will be ""disrupters,"" transforming the familiar, gas-powered, human-operated automobile into something out of a science fiction film. 
 
The challenges are many, but key among them are: 
 The need to slash emissions of traditional pollutants, as well as global warming CO2 gases; Demands to radically increase fuel economy, the U.S. setting a 54.5 mpg target for 2025, and Europe pushing even higher; Ever-stricter safety mandates, even some automakers now setting a goal of reaching a point where no one will be killed in a car crash; and A push to solve worsening urban traffic problems, a situation getting worse by the day as more of the world's population moves to megacities.       
 Attendees sit in the self-driving Mercedes-Benz F 015 concept car at the Mercedes-Benz booth at the International CES Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2015, in Las Vegas.  Jae C. Hong \/ AP 
 
In years past, simply addressing one of those issues would have been a daunting challenge. Resolving them all threatens to overwhelm even the largest and richest automakers. It's one reason why Sergio Marchionne, the CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, has said there must be major consolidation within the auto industry - and why he has been pressing General Motors for a merger of the two companies. 
 
Renault and Nissan linked up nearly two decades ago and more recently entered into a partnership with Germany's Daimler AG, the maker of Mercedes and Smart products. Together, they have already launched about 30 joint ventures aimed at reducing costs and pushing new technologies to market faster. That includes battery-car and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle projects, and they may soon work together on autonomous vehicle technology where they've separately been pressing for leadership. 
 
Alternative powertrain technology is one of the areas where manufacturers are likely to face the biggest challenges, and where they're most likely to work together. Developing even a conventional gasoline engine can be a billion dollar project. Coming up with high-mileage, low-emissions alternatives will cost far more, analysts warn. 
 
Autonomous vehicle could prove equally daunting, and as Google has learned with its own, industry-leading program, there are plenty of potential potholes. The maker's self-driving prototypes have been involved in more than a dozen crashes, in part because they were programmed to strictly obey the law. But jamming on the brakes when the light turns yellow risks your being rammed by the car behind, driven by a human hoping to save time by running the light. 
 
""This will not be a boring, commodity business,"" said Ghosn, but one rapidly evolving. 
 
Automakers aren't the only ones who will be challenged, however. Tomorrow's cars will be more expensive and more complex. Simply fueling - or charging - them up could become a very different process. 
 
Even today's latest models have become technological showcases, with more computer power than the typical home or office. But trying to figure out how to use everything can be overwhelming. Research by J.D. Power and Associates has found that in-car technology is the single-largest source of ""problems"" with new cars. 
     
 The new BMW 750i X-drive car is displayed at the booth of the German carmaker BMW during a press day of the 66th IAA auto show in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany, on September 16, 2015.  ODD ANDERSEN \/ AFP -  
 
With new features such as gesture controls and the ability to automatically park itself in a garage after the driver exits the vehicle, the new 2016 BMW 750i could be too much for less tech-savvy buyers. So, the Bavarian maker has launched the Encore program. A specially trained dealer rep will visit the buyer's home or office after a couple weeks to answer questions and show off the new features. 
 
Meanwhile, government will also need to play a role. If regulators mandate cleaner cars, automakers say federal, state and local officials need to come up with the money for high-speed battery chargers and hydrogen fueling stations. They may also need to set aside special highway lanes for autonomous vehicles, much like today's commuter lanes. 
 
A lot of things will have to come together in surprisingly short order if we're going to put those clean, fuel-efficient and safe bubble cars on the road in the next decade, rather than waiting a couple centuries.

Mercedes-Benz: world premiere of the Citaro NGT, two anniversaries 
 
Curtain call for the Mercedes-Benz Citaro NGT with natural gas drive. It impresses with its quiet running and reduced CO2 emissions – both are crucial advantages in the heavy traffic of city centres. Practical people will be convinced furthermore by the Citaro NGT’s low weight and a correspondingly large number of passenger seats, the engine’s strong performance, low fuel consumption and extended maintenance intervals. The new M 936 natural gas engine has a displacement of 7.7 l and is rated at 222 kW (302 hp). 
 
Mercedes-Benz offers the new powertrain variant as a Citaro NGT solo bus and as a Citaro G NGT articulated bus.

The touring coaches bearing the three-pointed star are coming up on significant anniversaries: at the Busworld Kortrijk, both the 10,000th Mercedes-Benz Travego as well as the 10,000th Tourismo of the second generation will be on display. This is evidence of the great popularity of both model series. Mercedes-Benz does not rest on these laurels and provides the appropriate proof with the new top-of-the-line engine for the Travego, the latest generation of the OM 471 in-line six-cylinder engine. It makes the Travego even more economically efficient and at the same time more powerful. The optional, two-way adjustable luxury head restraints are new in the passenger compartment of the Travego and Tourismo. 
 
With the economical Intouro intercity bus and the Sprinter City 65 packed with extensive infotainment equipment, Mercedes-Benz furthermore shows two very different variants for highly efficient and attractive regular service. 
 
Setra: further enhanced comfort, safety and efficiency 
 
Setra underscores its wide variety of products at the Busworld Kortrijk with four vehicles ranging from a functional low-entry bus for intercity transport and premium touring coaches to the fascinating versatile double-decker bus. In the super-high-decker Setra S 516 HDH of the top-of-the-range TopClass 500 model series on display, the new optional height-adjustable luxury head restraints with adjustable side bolsters highlight the classic Setra topic of passenger comfort. The “Composition” seat covers, a new material made of leather fibres, combine comfort and functionality. It is durable, hard-wearing and easy to clean. As a result, the new seat cover material is even superior to natural leather. 
 
The Setra TopClass 500 and ComfortClass 500 are now optionally available with LED main headlamps – a premiere for even more safety and economic efficiency. Their cone of light is defined with particular precision. The colour temperature approximates that of daylight and reduces eye strain for the driver. LED lamps reduce power consumption and last for about the service life of the vehicle. 
 
The three-axle Setra touring coaches now benefit from the latest iteration of the Mercedes-Benz OM 471 in-line six-cylinder engine with a displacement of 12.8 l. It is optionally available for the three-axle vehicles of the ComfortClass 500 and is rated at 350 kW (476 hp). This output stage is even standard in the Setra TopClass 500 top-of-the-range model series. A power output of 375 kW (510 hp) is available for this model series. It is standard equipment on the Setra S 431 DT double-decker coach. 
 
Setra continues the tradition of the club bus with the S 511 HD. Sixty years after the world premiere of the legendary S 6, Setra presents the S 511 HD with a length of 10.5 m, exclusive appointments and face-to-face seating. 
 
The S 415 LE business is a textbook example of comfortable and economical intercity transport. It combines a low-floor design at the front with a high-floor design at the rear. Introduced just one year ago, the model series has been received so well that Setra announced an expansion. The S 418 LE business for high-traffic intercity routes has room for 61 passengers and is a true seating giant. 
 
The latest generation of the Mercedes-Benz OM 471 engine in buses and coaches 
 
The three-axle premium touring coaches from Mercedes-Benz and Setra are now even more dynamic and economical: they further expand their lead in efficiency with the new generation of the Mercedes-Benz OM 471 heavy-duty engine. Fuel expenses drop by up to four percent while the driving dynamics are further enhanced. 
 
Depending on the brand and the model series, the engines come standard or optionally with power outputs of 350 kW (476 hp) or 375 kW (510 hp). A maximum injection pressure of up to 2700 bar, an increased compression ratio, the new geometry of the piston bowl, a new turbocharger manufactured in-house and a patented control of the exhaust gas recirculation system increase the efficiency. 
 
While the peak figures remain unchanged, this results in considerably increased output and torque in the lowest engine rev range and thereby in new characteristics of the in-line six-cylinder engine with a displacement of 12.8 l. 
 
Omniplus: services now also performed at the customer’s workshop 
 
The Omniplus service brand presents new service options at the Busworld Kortrijk. Bus depot management is directed at bus fleets: Authorised service outlets perform services at the customer’s workshop. Depending on the contract arrangements, this includes regular maintenance and repairs or even work on paint finishes and bodywork on site at the depot. 
 
Bus depot management ensures optimal care and high vehicle availability. From the vehicle to the services, the operator gets everything from a single source and is consequently able to reduce annual fleet expenses by up to ten percent. 
 
BusStore: new BusStore app, website in 18 languages 
 
BusStore, the new pre-owned bus brand of Daimler Buses, has established itself as the number one in the industry in Europe. BusStore buys, reconditions and sells buses from Mercedes-Benz and Setra as well as third-party marques and has 17 locations throughout Europe. 
 
The BusStore app is a new feature. It provides interested parties with direct access to the website offering Europe’s largest selection of used buses and coaches from anywhere and at any time. The clearly arranged and logically designed website at www.bus-store.com is now available in 18 languages and consequently covers all of Europe. 
 
FleetBoard: saving money with new telematics solutions 
 
FleetBoard supports fleet management and helps to save money with bus-specific telematics solutions. FleetBoard records trips, documents driving styles, analyses driver cards and makes it possible to determine the position of all buses in the fleet at any time. This creates maximum transparency. 
 
The bus app now lets users who want to monitor their buses while away from the office retrieve the most important data. FleetBoard Messaging for buses allows drivers and companies to exchange messages, receive geocoded addresses and get navigation instructions straight to the destination. Moreover, the expected time of arrival is determined and communicated to the head office. For vehicles equipped with the B2E electronics structure from Mercedes-Benz and Setra, FleetBoard is able to display the frequency of use of the Predictive Powertrain Control (PPC) cruise control system, the consumption and fill level of AdBlue as well as the tyre pressure. 
 
Mercedes-Benz Powertrain at Busworld in Kortrijk 
 
For the first time, Mercedes-Benz Powertrain is also represented at the Busworld show in Kortrijk, in Hall 8, presenting its current product portfolio on its own stand as a manufacturer of drive units. Mercedes-Benz Powertrain particularly excels with its outstanding systems expertise in all aspects of commercial vehicle powertrain technology, and with its worldwide after-sales network. With its presence at the Kortrijk show Mercedes-Benz Powertrain is also specifically targeting vehicle manufacturers, presenting the latest drive technologies for customer-specific applications. This allows market and customer segments to be addressed which Daimler Buses is presently unable to reach with its own complete vehicles and chassis. Two Euro VI engines from the medium and heavy Mercedes-Benz engine generation, the fully automated Mercedes PowerShift GO 250-8 eight-speed transmission and the weight-reduced HL6 formed axle are being presented on a stand area of approx. 70 sq. m. in Hall 8. 
 
The post appeared first on Car Shows .. Mercedes-Benz outlines its autonomous vision of the future. http:\/\/ift.tt\/1MovASm 
 
 
The manufacturer may not be a car company but a ‘Connected Mobility Services Provider’ in the future, according to boss Dieter Zetsche 
 
There is something in the air, and in the vast halls that make up the mile long Frankfurt motor show , you can almost smell it. 
 
If you believe those who will deliver the future of the car, we are on the eve of a revolution, one that will leave our children – or perhaps our children’s children – goggling at the profligate inefficiencies of the way we use our cars to this day. 
 
And there is no doubt the revolution is coming, the only remaining question is when. For some time it has been clear to me that having vast lumps of metal sitting inactive outside our homes and workplaces is not an exactly brilliant use of the resources and investment they represent. 
 
Every other transport industry, be it land, sea or air based, operates on the basis of a 24\/7 basis and for fairly obvious reasons. 
 
Why not the cars we drive? Last night Mercedes-Benz boss Dieter Zetsche gave his vision of the future of the automobile, and it involved us using cars on a just in time basis. So once our car has dropped us at the office, it beetles off under autonomous control to spend the day not sat in a car park, but working for someone else before returning to collect us at the end of the day. 
 
Except it won’t be the same car that took us to work, but whichever one of a pool of presumably millions that is closest and most readily available. This way cars keep moving, keep working and the advantages in terms reduced congestion and emissions are not hard to see. 
 
There will, of course be many fewer cars on the road but I guess they’ll wear out far more quickly so will need to be replaced far more often. 
 
Indeed Zetsche went so far as to suggest the Mercedes-Benz of the future will not be a car company but a ‘Connected Mobility Services Provider’. Catchy, huh? And while the idea may make your blood run cold it is hard to argue against the sheer logic of what he is suggesting, and if it’s going to happen anyway, there seems no more point fighting it than sitting on the sea-front and ordering back the waves. 
 
That said and for now at least I think those of us who still warm to the old fashioned concept of actually owning a car and enjoying their own car can relax. Just because a technology exists doesn’t mean it’s going to be adopted, otherwise we’d have all been driving hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars these last 20 years or more. 
 
You need not only the technology but a market that wants to buy it, and at a price it can afford. And to me, that still seems a very distant prospect.

Daimler Research & Development Chief Discusses Electric Cars, PHEV Profitability & More1 min ago	byMark Kane0Comments	Mercedes-Benz GLC 350 e 4MATIC Mercedes-Benz C-Class Plug-In Hybrid An interesting interview with Daimler Research & Development Chief Thomas Weber was recently published on the MotorTrend blog. First of all, Weber revealed that about half of M-B’s R&D annual budget ($1.65 billion out of $3.3 billion for Mercedes cars) goes on CO2 reduction. That’s millions every day. To lower CO2, the automaker is improving efficiency by: using more efficient engines more efficient transmissions (like new nine-speed) friction reductions low-resistance tires aerodynamic optimization lightweight body-in-white electrification \/ hybridization \/ new battery concepts They are also playing with hydrogen fuel cells: “Fuel-cell research is also included in his CO2-reduction basket. “We stay committed to fuel cells. Nobody knows if today’s type of battery EV will pay off in the end—the cars are OK but not the infrastructure.” The second important part is about why they are so focused on alternative powertrains and includes a discussion on whether on not plug-in hybrids profitable for Daimler. The answers are that regulations forced them, but they hope to attract consumers after introducing such cars on the market and plug-in hybrids are profitable, although less so than conventional models: “On the subject of alternative powertrains, does Weber think people buy them because they want them and want the fuel savings or because of the government incentives? He pauses. “I would say so far it’s more driven by regulation than the customer side. But I think we have to launch now so the customer will experience it. If you experience the smoothness of pure-electric zero emission in restricted areas with the drivability of an e-motor, then it might in the future be the drivetrain of choice. Why not? And if there is in addition subsidies or restricted areas where you can only go if you have a zero-emission car, in this combination we are sold out on our C-Class plug-in. We have to increase battery supply and production.” But do those things make money? “Well yes, of course the profitability of a non-plug-in version is better, but we are earning money with these kind of [PHEV] vehicles.” Source: MotorTrend blog Tags: daimler, mercedesGet UpdatesSubscribe to our e-mail newsletter to receive updates.Tweet. Mercedes S-Class Cabrio officially unveiled. Mercedes S-Class Cabrio officially unveiled Mercedes S-Class Cabrio Mercedes has officially unveiled the S-Class Cabrio following a leak earlier today.
Billed as one of the ""most beautiful and exclusive S-Class cars of all time,"" the model closely echoes the S-Class Coupe but it eschews the fixed roof for a retractable three-layer acoustic soft top which is available in black, dark blue, beige and dark red.  Despite its relatively large size, the roof can be opened or closed in approximately 20 seconds at speeds up to 60 km\/h (37.2 mph).
The interior also follows in the footsteps of the coupe but it gains an all-new THERMOTRONIC intelligent climate control system which promises to keep occupants comfortable regardless of whether the roof is opened or closed.  The convertible also offers an extensive assortment of upholstery choices including leather, nappa leather and designo Exclusive nappa leather.
Speaking of options, the model can be equipped with a Warmth Comfort package which includes heated seats, heated armrests and a heated multifunction steering wheel.  Customers can also order an AIR-BALANCE package which can waft a variety of fragrances into the cabin. If smells aren't your thing, you can order an optional AIRCAP automatic wind protection system or the familiar AIRSCARF neck-level heating system. 
The entry-level S500 Cabrio is powered by a twin-turbo 4.7-liter V8 that develops 455 PS (335 kW) and 700 Nm (516 lb-ft) of torque.  Buyers looking for something more powerful can opt for the S63 AMG or S63 AMG 4MATIC Cabrio which have a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V8 engine that cranks out 585 PS (430 kW) and 900 Nm (664 lb-ft) of torque.  It allows the all-wheel drive variant to accelerate from 0-100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds before hitting an electronically-limited top speed of 250 km\/h (155 mph).
The Mercedes S-Class Cabrio will go up for order in Germany in December and the first deliveries are slated for the spring of 2016. Source: Mercedes-Benz

tuttgart.  The new Cabriolet is the sixth variant of the current S-Class family and the first open-top luxury four-seater from Mercedes-Benz since 1971. It offers a distinctive, sensual and exclusive design, the cutting-edge technology of the S-Class and a comprehensive warmth and wind protection concept which includes intelligent climate control for convertibles. The elegantly sporty model will have its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in September.
Also on show in Frankfurt will be a superlative dream car from Mercedes?AMG in the guise of the S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet. Its 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine offers an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and peak torque of 900 Nm, AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split as standard and acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds.
""After 44 years we are once again able to offer Mercedes aficionados an open-top car in the S-Class. The new S-Class Cabriolet symbolises our passion for individual and timelessly exclusive mobility, which we share with our customers"", remarks Ola Källenius, Board Member of Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales.
The new S-Class Cabriolet is exceptionally rigid. Innovative solutions such as the luggage compartment bulkhead made of aluminium and magnesium as well as the aluminium rear floor also lower the bodyshell weight to the level of the S-Class Coupé. The standard-fit roll-over protection system behind the rear head restraints features pyrotechnic initiation of the actuators for the first time, in addition to which the roll bars themselves are moved into position by a gas generator.
""Two years after its launch, the S-Class family is now complete. We have never offered six models in the luxury class before - and never before have we enjoyed such success"", says Prof. Dr Thomas Weber, Member of the Daimler Board of Management responsible for Group Research and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. ""The S-Class sets the pace on the global market when it comes to safety, efficiency and comfort.""
Mercedes-Benz lays claim to building the world's most comfortable convertible. When it comes to climate comfort, the enhanced automatic wind protection system AIRCAP, the AIRSCARF neck-level heating system, the heated armrests, the seat heating also in the rear plus the intelligent climate control ensure that this is indeed the case. In contrast to conventional systems, the climate is controlled fully automatically. This means that the driver does not need to select a mode for closed or open top, nor is it necessary to save a temperature setting for these driving conditions.
A loving attention to detail is also evident in the luggage compartment concept: when the soft top is opened, it folds away into part of the luggage compartment. The soft top is separated from the remaining luggage compartment space by means of an electrically operated retractable cover which encloses the soft top. This luggage compartment partition extends automatically during opening of the soft top. This means that the driver no longer needs to stop in order to operate the luggage compartment cover manually, providing for added convenience. The partition will not be activated if the luggage compartment is loaded such that there are objects in the area of the partition. When the soft top is closed, the luggage compartment partition can be retracted by pressing a button in the inner panelling of the boot lid, so as to increase the available luggage space.
Additional boons are standard-specification electro-hydraulic remote locking for the luggage compartment and a through-loading facility into the interior.
Dynamic profile, superlative class: The design
""With its sensual and pure design idiom, our new S-Class Cabriolet is one of the most beautiful and exclusive S-Class cars of all time,"" says Gorden Wagener, Head of Design at Daimler AG. ""It embodies modern luxury in a very special way and is an expression of both effortless superiority and progressivity.""
The centrepiece of the front end is the black diamond radiator grille featuring the Mercedes star and a single louvre in silver with chrome inserts. The bonnet adds dynamic touches with two powerful character lines. The striking front bumper incorporates large air intakes in the middle and at the sides. The chrome trim adds a sporty finishing touch to the front end. The optional LED Intelligent Light System showcases the car's elegance in glittering style with exquisite Swarovski crystals for the direction indicators and daytime running lamps.
The side design of the S-Class Cabrio presents a thrilling dynamic coupé-style profile when the soft top is closed. Features of the side design include a low greenhouse, the dropping line of the side wall descending towards the rear and the fully retractable side windows. The multilayer, taut soft top underscores the vehicle's class when closed. The soft top is available in black, dark blue, beige and dark red.
The switch in the centre console can be used to open and close the soft top while on the move up to a speed of 60 km\/h. Opening and closing take around 20 seconds. The soft top is deposited above the automatically extending luggage compartment partition. The newly developed soft top from Mercedes Benz is a tensioning-arm top. When closing the soft top, the required closing forces are generated by moving the tensioning arms beyond the dead centre position – a process known as 'overcentering'. This avoids the need for any additional closures on the soft top compartment lid, in keeping with the high design quality embodied by the S-Class Cabrio. With the electronic key, opening and closing are also possible from outside the vehicle.
The rear end underscores the impression of width with flat LED tail lights and muscular shoulders. The closed soft top with glass window blends harmoniously into the rear view. The soft top compartment lid is framed by a wide chrome trim element. The rear bumper with diffusor-look lower section, two visible tailpipe trims and a horizontal chrome trim element add a sporty finish. The Mercedes star is hinged and performs several functions: it serves as a handle for manual opening of the boot lid and is also the cover for the reversing camera and the 360° camera (optional).
Inside, the S-Class Cabriolet boasts a luxuriously sporty design idiom and fine materials, conjuring up an exceptionally classy interior setting. The soft top opens up to create an open-air lounge that exudes a yacht-like atmosphere. The carefully matched choice of colours and materials and the high-quality controls in real metal or in chrome look underscore the vehicle's highly exclusive character. To enable the broadest scope for individualisation, there is a choice of leather, nappa leather or designo Exclusive nappa leather plus six different interior colour concepts, including a maritime-inspired combination of deep-sea blue and porcelain. The materials feature the highest standard of workmanship and are hand-crafted in character.
Exemplary low wind noise
With a Cd value of 0.29, aerodynamics world champion Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark in this segment with the S-Class Cabrio. The excellent air flow characteristics are attributable, for example, to the underbody panelling concept with extensive engine compartment and main floor panelling, the extensive rear axle cladding, the aerodynamically optimised wheel spoilers, the aerodynamic shape of the exterior mirrors and the well-balanced power split between front and rear axle.
As a worthy sister model for the S-Class Coupé – the series production car with the quietest interior of all – the open four-seater offers excellent noise-related comfort, too. A three-layer acoustic soft top comes as standard. The outer fabric cover incorporates a butyl layer as a water barrier on the inside, as opposed to the previous neoprene layer. This lowers noise levels, as does the enhanced upholstery matting and the acoustically optimised roof lining. The insulating layer also ensures that the elegant profile silhouette is not spoiled by bows that are visible from the outside.
Bodyshell measures, the sealing concept for the doors and the double glazing are also crucial to the low wind noise level in the interior. In addition to noise-related comfort, the aerodynamics engineers have also devoted special attention to maintaining a draught-free interior. The new S-Class Cabrio is optionally available with the AIRCAP automatic wind protection system. This can be extended at the touch of a button to reduce turbulence in the interior. AIRCAP consists of two components: a wind deflector with a net, set into the roof frame, that can be extended by seven centimetres, plus a similarly extendable draught-stop behind the rear seats, with a convex contour and stainless steel trim. The innovative diffusor ribs on the bottom edge of the front louvre are a further development. They produce specific turbulence effects to reduce the noise level. The wind deflector is finished in the body colour on the S-Class Cabrio.
Another optionally available feature is the AIRSCARF neck-level heating. This extends the convertible season by enabling comfortable open-top driving even at low outside temperatures. With this patented neck-level heating system, warmed air circulates around the head and neck areas of the occupants from the head restraints.
THERMOTRONIC: particularly intelligent climate control
The new S-Class premieres an intelligent climate control system which in future will provide for ideal climate comfort coupled with maximum user-friendliness in all open-top vehicles from Mercedes-Benz. The air conditioning experts at Mercedes?Benz developed a new software architecture specifically for this system, which underwent rigorous testing on state-of-the-art ""hardware-in-the-loop"" test stands prior to fine-tuning in the climate tunnel and on test drives.
In contrast to conventional systems, the climate is controlled fully automatically. This means that the driver does not need to select a mode for closed or open top, nor is it necessary to save a temperature setting for these driving conditions. An overlapping function performs the considerable feat of achieving an unnoticeable transition between closed and open top (and vice-versa) for maximum climate comfort. The Cabrio benefits here from the sophisticated climate control concept for the S-Class, which enables automatic individual control of each nozzle, for example.
The air conditioning control unit is fully networked and communicates with numerous vehicle components. In all, 12 sensors and 18 actuators provide for an ideal climate in all conditions. In addition to interior and exterior temperature, the sensors also detect the level of solar radiation. A sensor for air quality and harmful gases constantly monitors the quality of the outside air being drawn in. To effectively prevent the windows from fogging up, a dewpoint sensor measures the absolute humidity on the front windscreen. Two solar sensors on the dashboard and on the rear shelf ensure that blower level and temperature are adjusted to the selected settings in good time in response to any changes in solar irradiation.
With two climate zones and three climate styles (diffuse, medium or focused), the standard-fit THERMOTRONIC automatic climate control system enables an individual feel-good climate on board. Driver and front passenger are able to control the temperature, airflow and air distribution and to vary the temperature of their footwells in five levels, independently of each other. The status of the soft top influences air distribution, blower operation and temperature control. The new THERMOTRONIC with intelligent climate control follows the Mercedes-Benz philosophy of supplying cold air quickly after starting up the vehicle and subsequently controlling the climate as inconspicuously as possible.
The optionally available Warmth Comfort package provides for even cosier warm conditions. The armrests on the centre console and the doors as well as the multifunction steering wheel can be heated in addition to the seats. Driver and front passenger can choose between three different heating levels at the touch of a button. The AIR-BALANCE package, featuring fragrancing and ionisation as well as additional air cleaning by activated charcoal filter, is also available. PACIFIC MOOD is a new fragrance which is available exclusively for the Cabriolet.
Drive, suspension, active safety: a fully-fledged member of the S-Class family
The V8 engine of the S 500 Cabrio has an output of 335 kW (455 hp). The displacement stands at 4663 cc and the engine produces peak torque of 700 Nm from 1800 rpm. In NEDC combined mode the Cabrio gets by on 8.5 litres of premium-grade petrol per 100 km, with CO2 emissions of 199 g\/km. The innovative 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission supports both a dynamic and a fuel-saving driving style.
The S-Class Cabrio is fitted as standard with the full-support AIRMATIC semi-active air suspension featuring infinitely variable damping control. This system sets standards with respect to road roar and handling stability. It can be set to a sportier or more comfort-oriented mode, according to personal tastes. The four-link front axle impresses with a high level of driving comfort, plus precise suspension action.
Like the S-Class Saloon and Coupé, the new Cabrio is available with numerous new assistance systems that make driving even more comfortable and safer. Intelligent Drive systems include PRE-SAFE® Brake with pedestrian detection, DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot, Brake Assist BAS PLUS with Cross?Traffic Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus and Night View Assist Plus. In addition to a distance and collision warning function in conjunction with Adaptive Brake Assist, which offers collision protection from speeds as low as 7 km\/h, the COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS system installed in even the standard vehicle also features an additional function: when a danger of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to more than 100 km\/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles. At speeds of up to around 50 km\/h the system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles, and is able to prevent rear-end collisions at up to around 40 km\/h.
The PRE-SAFE® preventive occupant protection system has been upgraded to PRE?SAFE® PLUS. PRE-SAFE® PLUS can recognise an imminent rear-end collision and warn following traffic by flashing the rear hazard warning lights at a high frequency. When a danger of collision persists, the system can ""lock"" the brakes of the stationary vehicle prior to a rear-end collision and activate the PRE-SAFE® belt tensioners immediately before impact. This action minimises the risk of whiplash injury by reducing the forwards jolt caused by the impact and ensuring that the occupants are in the best possible position.
Intelligent lightweight design: extremely rigid, remarkably light
As the sixth variant of the current S-Class, the new S-Class Cabriolet (length\/width\/height: 5027\/1899\/1417 mm) is a member of the world's largest luxury model family. Its closest relative is the S-Class Coupé, from which the Cabrio adopts around 60 percent of its bodyshell components. A completely new feature is the rear floor, produced in aluminium for the first time. This raises the share of this lightweight metal in terms of surface area to over 50 percent in the overall intelligent mix of materials.
Striking new components are the longitudinal members in die-cast aluminium, based on a technology which was developed for the current SL. With the aid of a sand core, the longitudinal member is produced as a closed cast body which is hollow inside. This enables various components to be integrated in the longitudinal member, while also making varying wall thicknesses possible. This means a functionally ideal and weight-optimised design for the longitudinal member. In order to attain the high functional objectives (noise, vibration, durability and crash characteristics), the multifunction well (previously: spare wheel well) is welded in place in the bodyshell.
Another noticeable new feature is the rear wall behind the rear seats, which serves to reinforce the body while at the same time supporting the pyrotechnically extending roll bars and also incorporating a through-loading opening into the luggage compartment. This rear wall consists of aluminium sections whose characteristic shape has earned this component the internal nickname ""hockey goal"". Two shear panels, in the form of the magnesium rear wall and a cover consisting of aluminium sections, assure this assembly of high rigidity. The rear wall is attached via two additional large cast aluminium parts to the side wall. There are also numerous reinforcements on the underfloor to enhance the four-seater convertible's rigidity.
In all, the body engineers have achieved two essentially contradictory aims: in terms of torsional stiffness, the S-Class Cabrio even attains values on a par with those of the S-Class Coupé which was superseded last year, while at the same time the bodyshell weight of the current closed sister model has been maintained. The weight-saving measures also include ingenious solutions such as the vibration absorber which the hydraulic pump of the automatic soft top uses as additional weight, thereby saving around 7 kg.
Standard-fit roll over protection system: Fully pyrotechnic
On detecting an impending danger of the vehicle rolling over, the airbag control unit sends a corresponding signal to the roll over protection system. This is quickly extended behind the rear head restraints, helping to maintain a safe passenger compartment. The roll bars are extended not by spring force, but – for the first time on a Mercedes-Benz – by pyrotechnical means, using a gas generator.
This is made possible by state-of-the-art yaw rate sensors which, in contrast to the previously employed tilting cone sensors, virtually rule out incorrect actuation. In keeping with the S-Class Cabriolet's high design quality, there are no tear lines in the panelling behind the rear head restraints.
Heritage: coveted dream cars of the 1960s
The new S-Class Cabriolet is carrying the long and successful tradition of Mercedes-Benz luxury-segment cabriolets into the future. Even back in the 1920s the luxury cabriolets from Stuttgart combined the freedom of open-top motoring with the comfort and safety of a Mercedes-Benz Saloon. From the start of post-war production the top models from Mercedes-Benz were also available in the particularly exclusive variant as a cabriolet. These included the 170 S (W 136) from 1949, the 220 (W 187) from 1951 and the 300 S (W 188) from 1952.
After the ""Ponton"" cabriolets 220 S (W 180) and 220 SE (W 128) built from 1956 to 1960, in 1961 the 220 SE Cabriolet of the model series W 111 was launched, a particularly elegant, open-top four-seater, whose design is still considered timeless to this day.
In this ten-year production period Mercedes-Benz offered five different models in these model series: the 220 SE, 250 SE, 300 SE (W 112), 280 SE and, as a late top model, the eight-cylinder 280 SE 3.5 – in total 7013 units of these five cabriolets were manufactured in Sindelfingen. For the time being there was no open-top luxury-segment car in the Mercedes-Benz model range to follow this generation: rather, it is the new SL from model series 107 from 1971 onwards which cultivated the tradition of open-top motoring in the Stuttgart brand's cars – as a two-seater.
The cabriolets from Mercedes-Benz are today amongst the most sought-after classic cars - and the prices have developed accordingly. Examples of this are the Cabriolets from model series 111 the values of which are cited by the renowned American Hagerty Insurance's price guide. In its estimation a 280 SE 3.5 from the final year of construction, 1971, in condition 2 today has a value of around 290,000 US$ - ten years ago the figure was some 115,000 US$. But that is by no means the pinnacle: for instance, a specimen of this model in excellent condition was auctioned last August by RM Auctions for 429,000 US$.
The last six-cylinder 280 SE model (1969) in the same condition is valued today by Hagerty at approx. 75,000 US$ - about 45,000 US$ ten years ago. Early 220 SE models are around the same level, with a current value of some 84,000 US$.
The new Mercedes-AMG S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet
The ultimate dream car
Affalterbach.  Mercedes-Benz is presenting a superlative dream car in the guise of the S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet. For the first time in its 48-year history, Mercedes?Benz's sports car and high-performance brand is offering a four-seater Cabriolet in the S-Class segment, adding to its product portfolio an attractive alternative for automobile enthusiasts with a penchant for performance and luxury. The new model also offers its driver and up to three passengers space to travel in style. Its high-calibre statistics: 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine with an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and peak torque of 900 Nm, AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split as standard, acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds and a high-performance composite brake system for optimum deceleration.
High-performance technology coupled with expressive exterior and interior design: It is immediately apparent that the new S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet is built by car enthusiasts for car enthusiasts. ""The new S 63 Cabriolet is another fascinating AMG dream car from Affalterbach"", says Tobias Moers, Chairman of the Board of Management of Mercedes-AMG GmbH. ""The new model demonstrates in impressive style that we are keeping our foot firmly on the gas in 2015. We are continuing our model initiative with a vengeance - in all market segments.""
AMG Lightweight Performance
The basis for the vehicle's superior and dynamic character is provided by the particularly rigid bodyshell structure featuring innovative solutions such as the luggage compartment bulkhead made of magnesium.
The increase in weight which is inherent to the design of a convertible has been limited by the use of a lightweight lithium-ion battery, AMG light-alloy wheels produced by means of a sophisticated forging process and the weight-optimised AMG high-performance composite brake system. In addition, large parts of the shell and the front section are made of aluminium, as is the vehicle's rear end.
AMG 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine: superior and efficient
In terms of maximum output, torque and fuel consumption, the AMG 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine remains one of the most efficient series-produced V8 engines in the world. With an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and 900 Newton metres of torque, the AMG eight-cylinder engine meets the very highest standards. And the same goes for its performance: the S 63 Cabriolet accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds and has a top speed of 250 km\/h (electronically limited).
NEDC fuel consumption of 10.4 litres per 100 kilometres makes the two-door model the most fuel-efficient model in its competitive segment. This just goes to show that performance, efficiency and environmental compatibility need not be mutually exclusive aims.
Exhaust system with automatic exhaust flaps
The S 63 Cabriolet also adapts to the driver's individual wishes in terms of its engine sound – from emotional and sporty to a more restrained alternative suitable for long journeys. The exhaust system has automatic logic-controlled exhaust flaps in both rear silencers. When the transmission is in ""C"" (Controlled Efficiency) mode, the flaps remain closed in most situations, in which case the eight-cylinder biturbo engine's sound is more understated. In ""S"" (Sport) and ""M"" (Manual) modes, the exhaust flaps open earlier and more spontaneously, especially if the driver prefers a dynamic driving style. This results in an emotional, signature AMG engine sound.
""One man, one engine"": a tradition of hand-built excellence
The biturbo eight-cylinder engine of the S 63 Cabriolet is fitted by hand in the hand-finishing section of AMG's production plant in Affalterbach. Highly qualified engine fitters assemble the engines according to the strictest quality standards based on the ""one man, one engine"" philosophy. Apart from serving as an AMG hallmark confirming superlative precision and production quality, the AMG engine plate bearing the engine technician's signature also alludes to the peerless DNA of Mercedes-Benz's sports car and high-performance brand.
Individuality: AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission
The AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission combines perfectly with the V8 biturbo engine. Maximum agility and exciting dynamics are the two key strengths of this transmission, which is used exclusively at AMG. Drivers can configure their own personal set-up, depending on their driving style. There are three modes to choose from: ""C"" (Controlled Efficiency), ""S"" (Sport) and ""M"" (Manual). The ECO start\/stop function features as standard and is activated in transmission mode ""C"".
Performance-oriented AMG 4MATIC all-wheel drive
There are two variants of the S 63 Cabriolet available: with rear-wheel drive (as RHD version only) or with the performance-oriented AMG 4MATIC all-wheel drive (as LHD version). The combination of S-Class Cabriolet and 4MATIC is exclusive to the AMG variant. The drive distributes 33 percent of the engine torque to the front axle and 67 percent to the rear axle. This rear-biased power distribution provides for the signature AMG high driving dynamics and superlative driving enjoyment, and improves acceleration in all driving situations, including from a standing start. The all-wheel drive also enhances driving safety on wet or wintry road surfaces.
AIRMATIC air suspension
The AMG specialists have also pulled out all the stops when it comes to the suspension: The S 63 Cabriolet comes with the AIRMATIC full-support air suspension featuring the adaptive damping system ADS PLUS, which can be preset to ""Sport"" or ""Comfort"". At the touch of a button, the special configurations of these two programmes enable outstanding agility and dynamics or unlimited comfort on long journeys and smooth cruising at low speeds.
Specific front axle kinematics – including a higher camber, a larger anti-roll bar and a stiffer subframe carrier on the rear axle – have also been developed for the Cabriolet. The AMG-specific elastokinematics and parameterisation of the continuously variable damper control, the lower air volume of the air suspension system and the progressive piston geometry nip unpleasant rolling and pitching in the bud.
It is also possible to raise the vehicle's level by 30 millimetres on poor surfaces. The chassis is lowered again automatically in ""Sport"" mode and from a speed of 120 km\/h in ""Controlled Efficiency"" mode.
Systematic lightweight construction: AMG forged wheels as standard
The S 63 Cabriolet is equipped with forged AMG light-alloy wheels as standard. This forged design provides for extremely strong and particularly light wheels. The resultant lower unsprung masses give rise to advantages in terms of handling and spring\/damper element response. In the standard specification, the S 63 Cabriolet is fitted with multi-spoke forged wheels painted in titanium grey with a high-sheen finish – 8.5 x 19 at the front and 9.5 x 19 at the rear, with 255\/45 R 19 and 285\/40 R 19 tyres respectively. Forged wheels are available as optional extras from the AMG Performance Studio, in size 8.5 x 20 at the front and 9.5 x 20 at the rear, fitted with tyres in size 255\/40 R 20 and 285\/35 R 20 respectively.
Optional AMG high-performance ceramic composite brake system
Short stopping distances and rapid deceleration are a given for the S 63 Cabriolet, which is equipped with a weight-optimised, fade-resistant high-performance composite brake system. A ceramic high-performance composite brake system is available as an option. The design, which is more than 20 percent lighter, ensures lower unsprung masses as well as enhanced driving dynamics, agility and ride comfort.
Design as an expression of sportiness and performance
The S 63 Cabriolet also boasts exciting looks to emphasise its sporty performance: The design is a stage for the exciting technology at the heart of the new dream car. Numerous exquisitely designed aerodynamic elements underscore the outstanding driving dynamics: the front end is dominated by the three-dimensional ""twin-blade"" radiator grille in silver chrome. Under the radiator grille is the ""A-wing"": this three-dimensional aerodynamic feature is painted in the body colour and sports the stylised ""A"" that is a hallmark of AMG vehicles. Large, black flics surround the outer cooling air intakes. Down below, the front splitter in silver chrome optimises the flow of air to the cooling modules. It also makes the vehicle appear closer to the road.
A similar effect is created by the side sill panels with their high-quality, three-dimensional inserts in silver chrome. Together with the lower feature line, these inserts make the S 63 Cabriolet exude dynamism even when it is at a standstill.
At the rear, the diffuser insert in high-gloss black also catches the eye straight away. The lower trim element in silver chrome is reminiscent of the A-wing at the front and provides an effective contrast. The two chromed twin tailpipes of the exhaust system with sports flaps are perfectly integrated into the diffuser insert.
Interior: beguiling luxury and sporty exclusivity
Opening the door reveals the beguilingly luxurious interior of the S 63 Cabriolet: the instrument panel almost seamlessly transitions into the doors in a wrap-around design. High-quality materials and fine workmanship are combined with a sporty, exclusive design idiom. The newly developed AMG sports seats with electrical adjustment, Memory function and seat heating offer the driver and front passenger optimum lateral support.
The three-spoke sports steering wheel with its distinctively contoured rim and perforated leather in the grip area allows perfect vehicle control. Aluminium shift paddles shorten the reaction time when changing gear and enhance dynamism. Another feature displaying the hallmark AMG look is the high-resolution TFT colour display as an instrument cluster with two animated round dials. In addition to the AMG-specific lettering and the needles in red\/silver, further distinctive design features include the start-up display, the AMG logo in the speedometer with 330 km\/h scale and the ""V8 BITURBO"" lettering in the rev counter.
World premiere in 2015 and market launch in 2016
The S 63 Cabriolet will have its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. It will go on sale in December, and the market launch will begin in the spring of 2016.

Mercedes-Benz Fashion Engagement – Green Carpet ERDEM. Mercedes-Benz Fashion Engagement – Focus on sustainability: The 2015 Green Carpet Challenge by ERDEM, in partnership with Mercedes Benz 
 
 
On 21 September 2015, Livia Firth, Founder and Creative Director of the consultancy Eco Age, and Erdem Moralioglu celebrated the launch of The London 2015 Green Carpet Collection by ERDEM with an exclusive, sustainable presentation at The Wallace Collection, in partnership with Mercedes-Benz. The London-based designer has been working alongside Eco-Age to create his first complete collection in accordance with the Green Carpet Challenge® (GCC) Brandmark criteria. Numerous celebrities attended the event for the launch, including Colin Firth, Suki and Immy Waterhouse, Lily Cole, Sophie Hunter, Ellie Goulding, Elizabeth McGovern, Baz Luhrmann and Christopher Bailey. 
 
The collection has been produced using reused, surplus or sustainably certified materials, creating 11 looks that capture Erdem’s signature style of versatile yet powerful femininity. In November selected styles from the collection will be available exclusively at the ERDEM flagship store and online as well as on Net-a-porter and Barneys New York. 
 
“We were delighted to have Mercedes-Benz as a partner for The London 2015 Green Carpet Collection launch event this year. In my view, the fashion industry should long have been meeting stringent requirements, similar to those that have become standard in the automotive industry, which would have brought us a great deal further,” says Livia Firth, Founder and Creative Director, Eco Age. 
 
Sustainability is one of the most important social topics of our time, affecting both, the automotive and fashion industries. Mercedes-Benz, the Stuttgart-based luxury car brand, makes systematic efforts to ensure that its vehicles and their manufacturing processes are as environmentally responsible and as sparing of resources as possible. The partnership with The Green Carpet Challenge, which coincides with the 20th anniversary of Mercedes-Benz’s fashion engagement, was a natural fit. 
 
“Commitment to the world of fashion is an established part of our marketing strategy,” says Wolfgang Schattling, Director of Motorsport Marketing Communications & Branded Entertainment at Mercedes-Benz. “Through this, we are increasingly able to engage with our female audiences, and to become part of their lifestyle as a brand. Sustainability is an increasingly decisive criterion. With regard to this, it is a logical step for us to support The Green Carpet Challenge. It wonderfully illustrates that design, luxury and responsible actions perfectly fit within a modern lifestyle.” 
 
This particular, current subject is highlighted by Mercedes-Benz’s Spring\/Summer 2016 campaign, entitled “Hybrid by Nature.” This latest campaign features the new GLC Plug-In Hybrid, which can cover up to 34 kilometres utilising electric power alone, with zero emissions. Well-known for her glamorous, funky style, French Editor Carlyne Cerf De Dudzeele set the scene for Dutch supermodel Doutzen Kroes and the new GLC Plug-In Hybrid in the campaign. 
 20 Years of dedication to fashion by Mercedes-Benz  
Over the past 20 years, Mercedes-Benz has established itself globally as a partner at selected fashion events. The brand is currently involved in more than 50 fashion platforms in over 40 countries, including Mercedes-Benz Fashion Weeks in Beijing, Madrid, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Istanbul and Berlin, as well as the acclaimed International Festival of Fashion and Photography in Hyères. The group recognised the parallels between exclusive cars and high-quality fashion collections at an early stage, as in both worlds, passion, style, innovative design, the finest materials and first-class technical implementation are critical factors for success. Mercedes-Benz has therefore consistently supported selected fashion events around the world over the course of two decades, making a name for itself in particular for promoting talented new designers. 
 Sustainability at Daimler AG  
Sustainability is an elementary component of business activities at Daimler AG. The group is committed to environmentally compatible product development and innovative concepts. These range from pioneering vehicle and drive system technologies, intelligent lightweight construction, the use of natural materials and the remanufacturing of components right up to sophisticated assistance systems that can prevent accidents. The group is investing heavily in plug-in hybrids – up to 2017, a new model will be launched in the market every four months, a total of ten new plug-in hybrids. Acting responsibly also means making road traffic even safer. Some 90 percent of traffic accidents are due to human error, which is why the company sees great potential in autonomous driving. Further, the “responsibility principle” also guides the premium brand in its dealings with employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, neighbours and NGOs. Daimler follows this guiding principle: only those who act ethically responsibly will also be commercially successful. 
 
The post appeared first on Car Shows .. 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA facelift spotted testing - first pictures. http:\/\/ift.tt\/1Lgw90A



Updated Mercedes-Benz CLA will go on sale towards the middle of next year, with minor styling and mechanical upgrades

These are the first pictures of the facelifted Mercedes-Benz CLA, which has been spotted testing ahead of going on sale towards the middle of next year.
Although styling changes for the CLA are minor, they're intended to bring the car in line with the rest of the facelifted A-Class range, which was revealed in June. A similarly upgraded version of the CLA Shooting Brake has also recently been spotted testing.
Among the styling changes to be applied to the CLA is a reprofiled front bumper and updated light clusters. The rest of the car remains largely unchanged.
Like the CLA Shooting Brake, the CLA is set to benefit from a series of engine updates, which are likely to improve on current fuel economy and CO2 emissions figures, while the car's suspension set-up is said to have been upgraded.
Among the new options in line for the CLA is the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission from the A-Class, while a new Dynamic Plus package will be available on the range-topping CLA45 AMG version.
Earlier this year Mercedes-AMG boss Tobias Moers confirmed that the CLA45 AMG would get the same engine as the updated A45 AMG. The turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine now produces 376bhp (up from 355bhp) and 350lb ft of torque in the A45.
Alongside the rest of the Mercedes-Benz model range, the CLA will receive new naming designations. Petrol versions feature just a number to denote their variant, while diesel models get a 'd' after their name, in place of the current CDI and Bluetec badges.

Vía Autocar RSS Feed http:\/\/ift.tt\/1Lgwal8. No Links to VW Emissions Allegations, Daimler Says. HAMBURG, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Daimler said its Mercedes-Benz Cars business was not affected by accusations raised against fellow German carmaker Volkswagen by U.S. authorities.

""We heard of the EPA's accusations against VW from the press. The issue described by the press does not apply to Mercedes-Benz Cars,"" Daimler said in an e-mailed statement, adding it was not aware of any investigation of Mercedes.

Europe's largest automaker is accused of designing software for .... Mercedes-Benz IAA concept at ... IAA. A Transformers S-Class? Well yes, that's not simply a misleading subhead to lure clicks in. This concept can grow, to benefit aerodynamics. And you thought it was just another big Benz coupe...

Anyone else seeing VW XL1 here?When the Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile (IAA) reaches 50mph - or if a button is pressed inside - eight segments extend at the rear of the car to increase the length by up to 390mm. That's not all; the front and rear bumpers extend by 25mm and 20mm respectively, those rather swish 'Active Rims' alter their cupping (' words, not ours) from 55mm to zero and the louvre in the front bumper moves 60mm rearwards, further benefitting airflow. It all sounds like a very neat party trick.

The point? To prove that cars still have efficiency gains to make, particularly as far as aerodynamics are concerned. With a Cd factor of just 0.19, the IAA drastically undercuts even the CLA, most aero efficient production car with a 0.22 rating. In standard mode it's 5,040mm long (the maximum length being 5,430mm) while sitting 1,995mm wide and 1,305mm tall. Quite elegant for such a big thing, isn't it? If this ""irresistible design"" really does preview future large saloons then bring 'em on!

Like an S-Class but more ... motor showNaturally with the future in mind there's a host of fanciful tech in the IAA that seems miles off now and will be optional in a C-Class before you realise. 'Car-to-X' technology sounds cooler than it is, allowing the car to communicate with other vehicles and information sources. Inside there are 'Optical Finger Navigation' buttons, enabling information displays to be scrolled through more easily. To find it's therefore powered by a regular plug-in hybrid is almost disappointing; where are the fuel cells when you need them? But then an electric range of around 40 miles and CO2 emission of 30g\/km or so (dependent on whether it's in super slippery mode or not) are hardly shabby.

On recent from, it's unlike to produce a concept without some tangible production prospects. Of course something identical to the IAA won't be at your dealer anytime soon but expect to see more active aero and and new interior technology filtering through the range. Fingers crossed the white leather remains for the show cars though.. Official: 2016 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Cabriolet. Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter After numerous teasers, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Cabriolet has just been unveiled before its world debut at the IAA Frankfurt Motor Show 2015 later this month. The S-Class Cabriolet becomes the sixth variant of the current S-Class family and is the first luxury four-seater with a convertible roof from Mercedes-Benz since 1971. Initially presented here in S500 Cabriolet guise, the car utilises a 4.6-litre V8 engine delivering a total of 455 hp and 700 Nm of peak torque from 1800 rpm. This engine is mated to an advanced 9-speed automatic transmission. Over the combined cycle, the Mercedes-Benz S500 Cabriolet returns 8.5 km of fuel per 100 km while emitting 199 g\/km of CO2 emissions. As the images suggest, the S-Class Cabriolet is most closely related to the S-Class Coupe. In fact, the drop-top adopts about 60 per cent of its body from the coupe. One of the most important new features is the aluminium rear floor which means that over 50 per cent of the S-Class Cabriolet’s surface area is made from aluminium. Elsewhere, the S-Class Cabriolet now features new die-cast aluminium longitudinal members to strengthen it and make up for the lack of a fixed roof. A rear wall has also been fitted behind the rear seats to further reinforce the body while also supporting the extending roll bars. The rear wall is again made from aluminium but does include some magnesium components. The side walls have also be strengthened with aluminium. All told, the torsional stiffness of the S-Class Cabriolet is on par with the coupe. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class Cabriolet is particularly efficient through the air with a drag efficient of just 0.29 thanks in part to the aerodynamically optimised wheel spoilers, the new wing mirrors, underbody panelling and extensive rear axle cladding. To further reduce wind turbulence for occupants, the AIRCAP automatic wind protection system is available with it extending at the touch of a button and featuring a wind deflector as well as a draught-stop behind the rear seats. Discussing the car, member of the Daimler board of management responsible for group research and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars development, Thomas Weber said “”Two years after its launch, the S-Class family is now complete. We have never offered six models in the luxury class before – and never before have we enjoyed such success. “The S-Class sets the pace on the global market when it comes to safety, efficiency and comfort.” Also at Frankfurt, the Mercedes-AMG S63 Cabriolet will debut. Show Press Release (5,031 More Words)
“Open-top luxury
Stuttgart. The new Cabriolet is the sixth variant of the current S-Class family and the first open-top luxury four-seater from Mercedes-Benz since 1971. It offers a distinctive, sensual and exclusive design, the cutting-edge technology of the S-Class and a comprehensive warmth and wind protection concept which includes intelligent climate control for convertibles. The elegantly sporty model will have its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in September. Also on show in Frankfurt will be a superlative dream car from Mercedes-AMG in the guise of the S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet. Its 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine offers an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and peak torque of 900 Nm, AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split as standard and acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds. “After 44 years we are once again able to offer Mercedes aficionados an open-top car in the S-Class. The new S-Class Cabriolet symbolises our passion for individual and timelessly exclusive mobility, which we share with our customers”, remarks Ola Källenius, Board Member of Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales. The new S-Class Cabriolet is exceptionally rigid. Innovative solutions such as the luggage compartment bulkhead made of aluminium and magnesium as well as the aluminium rear floor also lower the bodyshell weight to the level of the S-Class Coupé. The standard-fit roll-over protection system behind the rear head restraints features pyrotechnic initiation of the actuators for the first time, in addition to which the roll bars themselves are moved into position by a gas generator. Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand “Two years after its launch, the S-Class family is now complete. We have never offered six models in the luxury class before – and never before have we enjoyed such success”, says Prof. Dr Thomas Weber, Member of the Daimler Board of Management responsible for Group Research and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. “The S-Class sets the pace on the global market when it comes to safety, efficiency and comfort.” Mercedes-Benz lays claim to building the world’s most comfortable convertible. When it comes to climate comfort, the enhanced automatic wind protection system AIRCAP, the AIRSCARF neck-level heating system, the heated armrests, the seat heating also in the rear plus the intelligent climate control ensure that this is indeed the case. In contrast to conventional systems, the climate is controlled fully automatically. This means that the driver does not need to select a mode for closed or open top, nor is it necessary to save a temperature setting for these driving conditions. A loving attention to detail is also evident in the luggage compartment concept: when the soft top is opened, it folds away into part of the luggage compartment. The soft top is separated from the remaining luggage compartment space by means of an electrically operated retractable cover which encloses the soft top. This luggage compartment partition extends automatically during opening of the soft top. This means that the driver no longer needs to stop in order to operate the luggage compartment cover manually, providing for added convenience. The partition will not be activated if the luggage compartment is loaded such that there are objects in the area of the partition. When the soft top is closed, the luggage compartment partition can be retracted by pressing a button in the inner panelling of the boot lid, so as to increase the available luggage space. Additional boons are standard-specification electro-hydraulic remote locking for the luggage compartment and a through-loading facility into the interior. Dynamic profile, superlative class: The design “With its sensual and pure design idiom, our new S-Class Cabriolet is one of the most beautiful and exclusive S-Class cars of all time,” says Gorden Wagener, Head of Design at Daimler AG. “It embodies modern luxury in a very special way and is an expression of both effortless superiority and progressivity.” The centrepiece of the front end is the black diamond radiator grille featuring the Mercedes star and a single louvre in silver with chrome inserts. The bonnet adds Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand dynamic touches with two powerful character lines. The striking front bumper incorporates large air intakes in the middle and at the sides. The chrome trim adds a sporty finishing touch to the front end. The optional LED Intelligent Light System showcases the car’s elegance in glittering style with exquisite Swarovski crystals for the direction indicators and daytime running lamps. The side design of the S-Class Cabrio presents a thrilling dynamic coupé-style profile when the soft top is closed. Features of the side design include a low greenhouse, the dropping line of the side wall descending towards the rear and the fully retractable side windows. The multilayer, taut soft top underscores the vehicle’s class when closed. The soft top is available in black, dark blue, beige and dark red. The switch in the centre console can be used to open and close the soft top while on the move up to a speed of 60 km\/h. Opening and closing take around 20 seconds. The soft top is deposited above the automatically extending luggage compartment partition. The newly developed soft top from Mercedes Benz is a tensioning-arm top. When closing the soft top, the required closing forces are generated by moving the tensioning arms beyond the dead centre position – a process known as ‘overcentering’. This avoids the need for any additional closures on the soft top compartment lid, in keeping with the high design quality embodied by the S-Class Cabrio. With the electronic key, opening and closing are also possible from outside the vehicle. The rear end underscores the impression of width with flat LED tail lights and muscular shoulders. The closed soft top with glass window blends harmoniously into the rear view. The soft top compartment lid is framed by a wide chrome trim element. The rear bumper with diffusor-look lower section, two visible tailpipe trims and a horizontal chrome trim element add a sporty finish. The Mercedes star is hinged and performs several functions: it serves as a handle for manual opening of the boot lid and is also the cover for the reversing camera and the 360° camera (optional). Inside, the S-Class Cabriolet boasts a luxuriously sporty design idiom and fine materials, conjuring up an exceptionally classy interior setting. The soft top opens up to create an open-air lounge that exudes a yacht-like atmosphere. The carefully matched choice of colours and materials and the high-quality controls in real metal or in chrome look underscore the vehicle’s highly exclusive character. To enable the broadest scope for individualisation, there is a choice of leather, nappa leather or designo Exclusive nappa leather plus six different interior colour concepts, Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand including a maritime-inspired combination of deep-sea blue and porcelain. The materials feature the highest standard of workmanship and are hand-crafted in character. Exemplary low wind noise With a Cd value of 0.29, aerodynamics world champion Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark in this segment with the S-Class Cabrio. The excellent air flow characteristics are attributable, for example, to the underbody panelling concept with extensive engine compartment and main floor panelling, the extensive rear axle cladding, the aerodynamically optimised wheel spoilers, the aerodynamic shape of the exterior mirrors and the well-balanced power split between front and rear axle. As a worthy sister model for the S-Class Coupé – the series production car with the quietest interior of all – the open four-seater offers excellent noise-related comfort, too. A three-layer acoustic soft top comes as standard. The outer fabric cover incorporates a butyl layer as a water barrier on the inside, as opposed to the previous neoprene layer. This lowers noise levels, as does the enhanced upholstery matting and the acoustically optimised roof lining. The insulating layer also ensures that the elegant profile silhouette is not spoiled by bows that are visible from the outside. Bodyshell measures, the sealing concept for the doors and the double glazing are also crucial to the low wind noise level in the interior. In addition to noise-related comfort, the aerodynamics engineers have also devoted special attention to maintaining a draught-free interior. The new S-Class Cabrio is optionally available with the AIRCAP automatic wind protection system. This can be extended at the touch of a button to reduce turbulence in the interior. AIRCAP consists of two components: a wind deflector with a net, set into the roof frame, that can be extended by seven centimetres, plus a similarly extendable draught-stop behind the rear seats, with a convex contour and stainless steel trim. The innovative diffusor ribs on the bottom edge of the front louvre are a further development. They produce specific turbulence effects to reduce the noise level. The wind deflector is finished in the body colour on the S-Class Cabrio. Another optionally available feature is the AIRSCARF neck-level heating. This extends the convertible season by enabling comfortable open-top driving even at low outside temperatures. With this patented neck-level heating system, warmed Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand air circulates around the head and neck areas of the occupants from the head restraints. THERMOTRONIC: particularly intelligent climate control The new S-Class premieres an intelligent climate control system which in future will provide for ideal climate comfort coupled with maximum user-friendliness in all open-top vehicles from Mercedes-Benz. The air conditioning experts at Mercedes-Benz developed a new software architecture specifically for this system, which underwent rigorous testing on state-of-the-art “hardware-in-the-loop” test stands prior to fine-tuning in the climate tunnel and on test drives. In contrast to conventional systems, the climate is controlled fully automatically. This means that the driver does not need to select a mode for closed or open top, nor is it necessary to save a temperature setting for these driving conditions. An overlapping function performs the considerable feat of achieving an unnoticeable transition between closed and open top (and vice-versa) for maximum climate comfort. The Cabrio benefits here from the sophisticated climate control concept for the S-Class, which enables automatic individual control of each nozzle, for example. The air conditioning control unit is fully networked and communicates with numerous vehicle components. In all, 12 sensors and 18 actuators provide for an ideal climate in all conditions. In addition to interior and exterior temperature, the sensors also detect the level of solar radiation. A sensor for air quality and harmful gases constantly monitors the quality of the outside air being drawn in. To effectively prevent the windows from fogging up, a dewpoint sensor measures the absolute humidity on the front windscreen. Two solar sensors on the dashboard and on the rear shelf ensure that blower level and temperature are adjusted to the selected settings in good time in response to any changes in solar irradiation. With two climate zones and three climate styles (diffuse, medium or focused), the standard-fit THERMOTRONIC automatic climate control system enables an individual feel-good climate on board. Driver and front passenger are able to control the temperature, airflow and air distribution and to vary the temperature of their footwells in five levels, independently of each other. The status of the soft top influences air distribution, blower operation and temperature control. The new THERMOTRONIC with intelligent climate control follows the Mercedes-Benz philosophy of supplying cold air quickly after starting up the vehicle and subsequently controlling the climate as inconspicuously as possible. Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand The optionally available Warmth Comfort package provides for even cosier warm conditions. The armrests on the centre console and the doors as well as the multifunction steering wheel can be heated in addition to the seats. Driver and front passenger can choose between three different heating levels at the touch of a button. The AIR-BALANCE package, featuring fragrancing and ionisation as well as additional air cleaning by activated charcoal filter, is also available. PACIFIC MOOD is a new fragrance which is available exclusively for the Cabriolet. Drive, suspension, active safety: a fully-fledged member of the S-Class family The V8 engine of the S 500 Cabrio has an output of 335 kW (455 hp). The displacement stands at 4663 cc and the engine produces peak torque of 700 Nm from 1800 rpm. In NEDC combined mode the Cabrio gets by on 8.5 litres of premium-grade petrol per 100 km, with CO2 emissions of 199 g\/km. The innovative 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission supports both a dynamic and a fuel-saving driving style. The S-Class Cabrio is fitted as standard with the full-support AIRMATIC semi-active air suspension featuring infinitely variable damping control. This system sets standards with respect to road roar and handling stability. It can be set to a sportier or more comfort-oriented mode, according to personal tastes. The four-link front axle impresses with a high level of driving comfort, plus precise suspension action. Like the S-Class Saloon and Coupé, the new Cabrio is available with numerous new assistance systems that make driving even more comfortable and safer. Intelligent Drive systems include PRE-SAFE® PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot, Brake Assist BAS PLUS with Cross-Traffic Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus and Night View Assist Plus. In addition to a distance and collision warning function in conjunction with Adaptive Brake Assist, which offers collision protection from speeds as low as 7 km\/h, the COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS system installed in even the standard vehicle also features an additional function: when a danger of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to more than 100 km\/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles. At speeds of up to around 50 km\/h the system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles, and is able to prevent rear-end collisions at up to around 40 km\/h. Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand The PRE-SAFE® PRE-SAFE® and warn following traffic by flashing the rear hazard warning lights at a high frequency. When a danger of collision persists, the system can “lock” the brakes of the stationary vehicle prior to a rear-end collision and activate the PRE-SAFE® tensioners immediately before impact. This action minimises the risk of whiplash injury by reducing the forwards jolt caused by the impact and ensuring that the occupants are in the best possible position. Intelligent lightweight design: extremely rigid, remarkably light As the sixth variant of the current S-Class, the new S-Class Cabriolet (length\/width\/height: 5027\/1899\/1417 mm) is a member of the world’s largest luxury model family. Its closest relative is the S-Class Coupé, from which the Cabrio adopts around 60 percent of its bodyshell components. A completely new feature is the rear floor, produced in aluminium for the first time. This raises the share of this lightweight metal in terms of surface area to over 50 percent in the overall intelligent mix of materials. Striking new components are the longitudinal members in die-cast aluminium, based on a technology which was developed for the current SL. With the aid of a sand core, the longitudinal member is produced as a closed cast body which is hollow inside. This enables various components to be integrated in the longitudinal member, while also making varying wall thicknesses possible. This means a functionally ideal and weight-optimised design for the longitudinal member. In order to attain the high functional objectives (noise, vibration, durability and crash characteristics), the multifunction well (previously: spare wheel well) is welded in place in the bodyshell. Another noticeable new feature is the rear wall behind the rear seats, which serves to reinforce the body while at the same time supporting the pyrotechnically extending roll bars and also incorporating a through-loading opening into the luggage compartment. This rear wall consists of aluminium sections whose characteristic shape has earned this component the internal nickname “hockey goal”. Two shear panels, in the form of the magnesium rear wall and a cover consisting of aluminium sections, assure this assembly of high rigidity. The rear wall is attached via two additional large cast aluminium parts to the side wall. There are also numerous reinforcements on the underfloor to enhance the four-seater convertible’s rigidity. preventive occupant protection system has been upgraded to PLUS. PRE-SAFE® Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand In all, the body engineers have achieved two essentially contradictory aims: in terms of torsional stiffness, the S-Class Cabrio even attains values on a par with those of the S-Class Coupé which was superseded last year, while at the same time the bodyshell weight of the current closed sister model has been maintained. The weight-saving measures also include ingenious solutions such as the vibration absorber which the hydraulic pump of the automatic soft top uses as additional weight, thereby saving around 7 kg. Standard-fit roll over protection system: Fully pyrotechnic On detecting an impending danger of the vehicle rolling over, the airbag control unit sends a corresponding signal to the roll over protection system. This is quickly extended behind the rear head restraints, helping to maintain a safe passenger compartment. The roll bars are extended not by spring force, but – for the first time on a Mercedes-Benz – by pyrotechnical means, using a gas generator. This is made possible by state-of-the-art yaw rate sensors which, in contrast to the previously employed tilting cone sensors, virtually rule out incorrect actuation. In keeping with the S-Class Cabriolet’s high design quality, there are no tear lines in the panelling behind the rear head restraints. Heritage: coveted dream cars of the 1960s The new S-Class Cabriolet is carrying the long and successful tradition of Mercedes-Benz luxury-segment cabriolets into the future. Even back in the 1920s the luxury cabriolets from Stuttgart combined the freedom of open-top motoring with the comfort and safety of a Mercedes-Benz Saloon. From the start of post-war production the top models from Mercedes-Benz were also available in the particularly exclusive variant as a cabriolet. These included the 170 S (W 136) from 1949, the 220 (W 187) from 1951 and the 300 S (W 188) from 1952. After the “Ponton” cabriolets 220 S (W 180) and 220 SE (W 128) built from 1956 to 1960, in 1961 the 220 SE Cabriolet of the model series W 111 was launched, a particularly elegant, open-top four-seater, whose design is still considered timeless to this day. In this ten-year production period Mercedes-Benz offered five different models in these model series: the 220 SE, 250 SE, 300 SE (W 112), 280 SE and, as a late top model, the eight-cylinder 280 SE 3.5 – in total 7013 units of these five cabriolets were manufactured in Sindelfingen. For the time being there was no open-top Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand luxury-segment car in the Mercedes-Benz model range to follow this generation: rather, it is the new SL from model series 107 from 1971 onwards which cultivated the tradition of open-top motoring in the Stuttgart brand’s cars – as a two-seater. The cabriolets from Mercedes-Benz are today amongst the most sought-after classic cars – and the prices have developed accordingly. Examples of this are the Cabriolets from model series 111 the values of which are cited by the renowned American Hagerty Insurance’s price guide. In its estimation a 280 SE 3.5 from the final year of construction, 1971, in condition 2 today has a value of around 290,000 US$ – ten years ago the figure was some 115,000 US$. But that is by no means the pinnacle: for instance, a specimen of this model in excellent condition was auctioned last August by RM Auctions for 429,000 US$. The last six-cylinder 280 SE model (1969) in the same condition is valued today by Hagerty at approx. 75,000 US$ – about 45,000 US$ ten years ago. Early 220 SE models are around the same level, with a current value of some 84,000 US$.

Mercedes-Benz is presenting a superlative dream car in the guise of the S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet. For the first time in its 48-year history, Mercedes-Benz’s sports car and high-performance brand is offering a four-
seater Cabriolet in the S-Class segment, adding to its product portfolio an attractive alternative for automobile enthusiasts with a penchant for performance and luxury. The new model also offers its driver and up to three passengers space to travel in style. Its high-calibre statistics: 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine with an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and peak torque of 900 Nm, AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split as standard, acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds and a high-
performance composite brake system for optimum deceleration. High-performance technology coupled with expressive exterior and interior design: It is immediately apparent that the new S 63 4MATIC Cabriolet is built by car enthusiasts for car enthusiasts. “The new S 63 Cabriolet is another fascinating AMG dream car from Affalterbach”, says Tobias Moers, Chairman of the Board of Management of Mercedes-AMG GmbH. “The new model demonstrates in impressive style that we are keeping our foot firmly on the gas in 2015. We are continuing our model initiative with a vengeance – in all market segments.” AMG Lightweight Performance The basis for the vehicle’s superior and dynamic character is provided by the particularly rigid bodyshell structure featuring innovative solutions such as the luggage compartment bulkhead made of magnesium. The increase in weight which is inherent to the design of a convertible has been limited by the use of a lightweight lithium-ion battery, AMG light-alloy wheels produced by means of a sophisticated forging process and the weight-optimised AMG high-performance composite brake system. In addition, large parts of the shell and the front section are made of aluminium, as is the vehicle’s rear end. Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand Page 11 AMG 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine: superior and efficient In terms of maximum output, torque and fuel consumption, the AMG 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine remains one of the most efficient series-produced V8 engines in the world. With an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and 900 Newton metres of torque, the AMG eight-cylinder engine meets the very highest standards. And the same goes for its performance: the S 63 Cabriolet accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds and has a top speed of 250 km\/h (electronically limited). NEDC fuel consumption of 10.4 litres per 100 kilometres makes the two-door model the most fuel-efficient model in its competitive segment. This just goes to show that performance, efficiency and environmental compatibility need not be mutually exclusive aims. The data at a glance: Displacement 5461 cc Output 430 kW (585 hp) Peak torque 900 Nm Fuel consumption NEDC combined CO2 emissions 244 g\/km Efficiency class F Kerb weight (according to DIN\/EC) Power-to-weight ratio 3.61 kg\/hp Acceleration 0-100 km\/h Top speed 250 km\/h**** * Only available with left-hand drive; ** Ready-to-drive condition (fuel tank 90% full, without driver and luggage); *** Ready-to-drive condition (fuel tank 90% full, with driver (68 kg) and luggage (7 kg); **** Electronically limited. Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand Page 12 Exhaust system with automatic exhaust flaps The S 63 Cabriolet also adapts to the driver’s individual wishes in terms of its engine sound – from emotional and sporty to a more restrained alternative suitable for long journeys. The exhaust system has automatic logic-controlled exhaust flaps in both rear silencers. When the transmission is in “C” (Controlled Efficiency) mode, the flaps remain closed in most situations, in which case the eight-cylinder biturbo engine’s sound is more understated. In “S” (Sport) and “M” (Manual) modes, the exhaust flaps open earlier and more spontaneously, especially if the driver prefers a dynamic driving style. This results in an emotional, signature AMG engine sound. “One man, one engine”: a tradition of hand-built excellence The biturbo eight-cylinder engine of the S 63 Cabriolet is fitted by hand in the hand-
finishing section of AMG’s production plant in Affalterbach. Highly qualified engine fitters assemble the engines according to the strictest quality standards based on the “one man, one engine” philosophy. Apart from serving as an AMG hallmark confirming superlative precision and production quality, the AMG engine plate bearing the engine technician’s signature also alludes to the peerless DNA of Mercedes-Benz’s sports car and high-performance brand. Individuality: AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission The AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission combines perfectly with the V8 biturbo engine. Maximum agility and exciting dynamics are the two key strengths of this transmission, which is used exclusively at AMG. Drivers can configure their own personal set-up, depending on their driving style. There are three modes to choose from: “C” (Controlled Efficiency), “S” (Sport) and “M” (Manual). The ECO start\/stop function features as standard and is activated in transmission mode “C”. Performance-oriented AMG 4MATIC all-wheel drive There are two variants of the S 63 Cabriolet available: with rear-wheel drive (as RHD version only) or with the performance-oriented AMG 4MATIC all-wheel drive (as LHD version). The combination of S-Class Cabriolet and 4MATIC is exclusive to the AMG variant. The drive distributes 33 percent of the engine torque to the front axle and 67 percent to the rear axle. This rear-biased power distribution provides for the signature AMG high driving dynamics and superlative driving enjoyment, and Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand Page 13 improves acceleration in all driving situations, including from a standing start. The all-wheel drive also enhances driving safety on wet or wintry road surfaces. AIRMATIC air suspension The AMG specialists have also pulled out all the stops when it comes to the suspension: The S 63 Cabriolet comes with the AIRMATIC full-support air suspension featuring the adaptive damping system ADS PLUS, which can be preset to “Sport” or “Comfort”. At the touch of a button, the special configurations of these two programmes enable outstanding agility and dynamics or unlimited comfort on long journeys and smooth cruising at low speeds. Specific front axle kinematics – including a higher camber, a larger anti-roll bar and a stiffer subframe carrier on the rear axle – have also been developed for the Cabriolet. The AMG-specific elastokinematics and parameterisation of the continuously variable damper control, the lower air volume of the air suspension system and the progressive piston geometry nip unpleasant rolling and pitching in the bud. It is also possible to raise the vehicle’s level by 30 millimetres on poor surfaces. The chassis is lowered again automatically in “Sport” mode and from a speed of 120 km\/h in “Controlled Efficiency” mode. Systematic lightweight construction: AMG forged wheels as standard The S 63 Cabriolet is equipped with forged AMG light-alloy wheels as standard. This forged design provides for extremely strong and particularly light wheels. The resultant lower unsprung masses give rise to advantages in terms of handling and spring\/damper element response. In the standard specification, the S 63 Cabriolet is fitted with multi-spoke forged wheels painted in titanium grey with a high-sheen finish – 8.5 x 19 at the front and 9.5 x 19 at the rear, with 255\/45 R 19 and 285\/40 R 19 tyres respectively. Forged wheels are available as optional extras from the AMG Performance Studio, in size 8.5 x 20 at the front and 9.5 x 20 at the rear, fitted with tyres in size 255\/40 R 20 and 285\/35 R 20 respectively. Optional AMG high-performance ceramic composite brake system Short stopping distances and rapid deceleration are a given for the S 63 Cabriolet, which is equipped with a weight-optimised, fade-resistant high-performance composite brake system. A ceramic high-performance composite brake system is available as an option. The design, which is more than 20 percent lighter, ensures Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand Page 14 lower unsprung masses as well as enhanced driving dynamics, agility and ride comfort. Design as an expression of sportiness and performance The S 63 Cabriolet also boasts exciting looks to emphasise its sporty performance: The design is a stage for the exciting technology at the heart of the new dream car. Numerous exquisitely designed aerodynamic elements underscore the outstanding driving dynamics: the front end is dominated by the three-dimensional “twin-blade” radiator grille in silver chrome. Under the radiator grille is the “A-wing”: this three-
dimensional aerodynamic feature is painted in the body colour and sports the stylised “A” that is a hallmark of AMG vehicles. Large, black flics surround the outer cooling air intakes. Down below, the front splitter in silver chrome optimises the flow of air to the cooling modules. It also makes the vehicle appear closer to the road. A similar effect is created by the side sill panels with their high-quality, three-
dimensional inserts in silver chrome. Together with the lower feature line, these inserts make the S 63 Cabriolet exude dynamism even when it is at a standstill. At the rear, the diffuser insert in high-gloss black also catches the eye straight away. The lower trim element in silver chrome is reminiscent of the A-wing at the front and provides an effective contrast. The two chromed twin tailpipes of the exhaust system with sports flaps are perfectly integrated into the diffuser insert. Interior: beguiling luxury and sporty exclusivity Opening the door reveals the beguilingly luxurious interior of the S 63 Cabriolet: the instrument panel almost seamlessly transitions into the doors in a wrap-around design. High-quality materials and fine workmanship are combined with a sporty, exclusive design idiom. The newly developed AMG sports seats with electrical adjustment, Memory function and seat heating offer the driver and front passenger optimum lateral support. The three-spoke sports steering wheel with its distinctively contoured rim and perforated leather in the grip area allows perfect vehicle control. Aluminium shift paddles shorten the reaction time when changing gear and enhance dynamism. Another feature displaying the hallmark AMG look is the high-resolution TFT colour display as an instrument cluster with two animated round dials. In addition to the AMG-specific lettering and the needles in red\/silver, further distinctive design Daimler Communications, 70546 Stuttgart, Germany Mercedes-Benz – A Daimler Brand Page 15 features include the start-up display, the AMG logo in the speedometer with 330 km\/h scale and the “V8 BITURBO” lettering in the rev counter. World premiere in 2015 and market launch in 2016 The S 63 Cabriolet will have its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. It will go on sale in December, and the market launch will begin in the spring of 2016.”

The new Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupe. The new Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupe
Mercedes-AMG is setting a further landmark in the brand history: the new C 63 Coupé is the next step on the way to yet more technical and visual distinctiveness. The far-reaching technical modifications are evident at first sight: strikingly flared front and rear wheel arches, an increased track width and larger wheels give the Coupé a muscular look while at the same time providing a basis for the highly agile longitudinal and lateral dynamics.
 

The brand’s typical “Driving Performance” is taken to new heights also with the C 63 Coupé. The AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine with 350 kW (476 hp) or 375 kW (510 hp) is just as much a completely in-house development from Affalterbach as, for example, the sophisticated AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension with electronically controlled shock absorbers, the set-up of the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT transmission modes, the rear-axle limited-slip differential or the dynamic engine mounts.

The C-Class is Mercedes-AMG’s best-selling model series and forms the backbone of the company’s success. Since its launch in 2011, the Coupé version has steadily gained in significance, culminating with the C 63 AMG Coupé “Black Series”. “The new C 63 Coupé embodies our conception of progress: It offers impressive longitudinal and lateral dynamics at an extremely high level along with improved fuel economy,” says Tobias Moers, Chairman of the Board of Management of Mercedes-AMG GmbH. “In addition, we are making a bold visual statement with the muscular design. Our customers can therefore experience the progress with each of their senses: seeing, hearing, feeling and, above all, driving!” The Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupé will celebrate its world premiere on 15 September 2015 at the Frankfurt International Motor Show (IAA). The market launch will begin in March 2016.

Fascinating design visualises outstanding performance

The Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupé already fascinates at first glance with its impressive proportions. The expressive exterior design differs significantly from the Mercedes-Benz model, which shares merely the same doors, roof and boot lid. The powerful 8-cylinder engine, together with the increased track width on the front and rear axles, calls for a redesigned front end and a model-specific rear assembly as well as new side walls. The flared wheel arches make the AMG Coupé 64 millimetres wider at the front and 66 millimetres wider at the rear, enabling the vehicle to hug the road better.

The larger wheel arches allow the use of wider tyres (up to 255 millimetres on the front axle and up to 285 millimetres on the rear axle), contributing to improved lateral acceleration, traction and agility. Under the outer skin, the body structure has been reinforced in key areas to transfer and compensate the extreme longitudinal and lateral forces from the powertrain and suspension. There is also the model-specific rear axle carrier.

The 60-millimetre-longer aluminium bonnet is adorned by two distinctive powerdomes, which are among the typical distinguishing features and underscore the muscular appearance. The extremely wide front section is characterised by large air inlets and precisely positioned flics. The low, arrow-shaped “twin blade” radiator grille with AMG lettering visually lowers the vehicle’s centre of gravity. The typical AMG “A-wing” front spoiler is three-dimensional, also serving as an air deflector for the three cooling air inlets. Additional flics ensure an optimal flow of air to the cooling modules. And a front splitter at the bottom of the front apron helps to reduce front-axle lift.

The side line, too, presents an entirely unique face thanks to the large wheels, which finish flush with the body on the far outside, and the special side skirts. The lateral inward step from door to sill lends additional emphasis to the wide base. Added benefit of the newly designed body elements: no compromises were required with regard to the connection of the aprons and other components: every joint and light-catching contour blends in harmoniously with the overall design. In the diagonal view from behind, the muscular line from roof to shoulder via side wall and wheel cutout looks especially impressive, lending emphasis to the impression of an intricately modelled sculpture with alternating light reflections. Fine detail: in typical sports car fashion, the exterior rear-view mirrors are mounted on the door rather than in the mirror triangle.

Taking its inspiration from the S-Class Coupé, the completely redesigned rear end includes a diffuser insert that revives a typical feature from the world of motor sport. The special design of the laterally positioned, optical air outlet openings improves the rear air flow, allowing it to break away with aerodynamically advantageous precision. Features such as the narrow rear reflectors reinforce the impression of width. The two chrome-plated twin tailpipes of the AMG exhaust system are perfectly integrated into the diffuser. The boot lid includes a narrow spoiler lip in the form of a sharp blade. It not only looks elegant, but also significantly reduces the rear-axle lift.

Interior with superior perceived quality

Carefully selected, high-grade materials with a pleasant touch and precision workmanship produce a level of perceived quality that is rare even in higher vehicle classes. Numerous AMG-specific controls underscore the motor sport heritage. As an alternative to the standard sports seats in ARTICO\/microfibre DINAMICA man-made leather, Performance seats are also available: these allow the occupants a lower seating position and are more strongly contoured for increased lateral support.

Top on performance

Also as regards its engine, the C 63 Coupé occupies an exceptional status among the competition, being the only vehicle in the segment to boast an 8-cylinder biturbo engine. Mercedes-AMG thus meets the wishes of those customers who desire a combination of a highly emotive, unmistakable engine sound and torquey power delivery.

The driver also benefits from the unrivalled performance: the C 63 S Coupé accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds, the C 63 Coupé in 4.0 seconds. This makes the Coupé just a fraction faster than the Saloon – thanks to the wider tyres and shorter-legged rear-axle ratios. The top speed is 250 km\/h (electronically limited; 290 km\/h with AMG Driver’s Package).

New V8 biturbo closely related to the engine in the Mercedes-AMG GT

The 4.0-litre 8-cylinder biturbo engine is already used in the C 63 Saloon and the C 63 Estate. It is also installed in the GT sports car with dry sump lubrication. Characteristic feature: the two turbochargers are positioned not on the outside of the cylinder banks, but between them in the “V” – experts call this a “hot inside V”. The main advantages of this design are the compact engine construction, optimal response and low exhaust gas emissions.

Exhaust system with flap technology for variable engine sound

The typical V8 engine sound was likewise a key development goal. It was specially tailored to the Coupé. A model-specific exhaust system with flap technology is used as standard. It is automatically map-controlled depending on the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT transmission mode, the power demanded by the driver and the engine speed. The engine sound varies between discreet\/suitable for long-distance driving and robust\/emotively appealing. Optionally available is the Performance exhaust system, which allows the sound to be modulated at the press of a button. In any case, the exhaust systems are so designed that all noise limits are at all times complied with irrespective of the flap position.

Faster gearshifts: the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission

The transmission plays a major part in the direct and sporty character of the new Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupé. The AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission impresses with its tailor-made dynamics and high variability. Whether automatic or initiated by the driver using the steering wheel shift paddles, upshifts and downshifts are executed noticeably faster than in the previous model. This increased spontaneity is made possible by an even sportier set-up of the engine and transmission parameters.

Specially developed suspension for maximum lateral and longitudinal dynamics

The fascinating agility and high cornering speed of the C 63 Coupé are also thanks to the completely redesigned suspension. A four-link front suspension with radial, racing-style brake connections is used. Model-specific steering knuckles and a wider track allow greater lateral acceleration. The rear axle, too, was completely newly developed for the Coupé. The multi-link concept impresses with highly precise wheel control and increased stiffness. The AMG-specific rear axle carrier makes the increased track width possible; the contact surfaces of the wheel bearings were moved a further 25 millimetres towards the outside in comparison with the Saloon. Other measures include AMG-specific wheel carriers, stiffer elastokinematic tuning and higher negative camber.

The C 63 Coupé comes as standard with 10-spoke light-alloy wheels 9.0″ x 18″ (front) and 10.5″ x 18″ (rear) as well as with tyres of size 255\/40 R 18″ (front) and 285\/35 R 18″ (rear). In the case of the C 63 S Coupé, the tyre sizes are 255\/35 R 19″ (front) and 285\/30 R 19″ (rear) on 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels 9.0″ x 19″ (front) and 10.5″ x 19″ (rear).

With the AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension with adjustable damping, the customer can choose between maximum sportiness and excellent long-distance comfort in three stages at the press of a button. The difference between the comfortable and sporty suspension settings is also subjectively perceptible – depending on the particular driving situation.

Rear-axle limited-slip differential: optimal traction, including on the race track

For improved traction and vehicle dynamics, the C 63 Coupé is provided with a mechanical rear-axle limited-slip differential, while the C 63 S Coupé comes with an electronic rear-axle limited-slip differential. Both differentials reduce the slip on the inside wheel when cornering, without control interventions in the braking system. This allows the driver to accelerate out of corners earlier thanks to the improved traction. The car remains more stable when braking from high speeds, and the limited-slip differential also improves traction when moving off. The model-specific, completely redesigned rear axle was specially adapted to the higher vehicle dynamics of the Coupé.

The greatest benefit of the electronic rear-axle limited-slip differential – installed as standard on the C 63 S – is the even more sensitive and faster control, which further raises the critical limit of driveability. The 3-stage ESP® with “ESP ON”, “ESP SPORT Handling Mode” and “ESP OFF” settings works in perfect unison with the rear-axle limited-slip differential and is optimally tuned to the outstanding dynamics.

AMG DYNAMIC SELECT transmission modes

The driver is able to influence the characteristics of the C 63 with four different AMG DYNAMIC SELECT transmission modes. The C 63 S has an additional “Race” transmission mode. There is therefore scope for maximum individualisation. The driver decides on the desired driving experience, from comfortable-economical to super-sporty, using a controller to the left of the touchpad. The driver can choose between various preconfigured transmission modes and an “Individual” mode that the driver can to a large extent personally configure.

C 63 S with dynamic engine mounts as standard

Unique in its segment, the C 63 S Coupé – like the Saloon and the Estate – is equipped with dynamic engine mounts. These help to further resolve the conflicting aims of comfort and dynamic performance. These dynamic mounts are instantly and variably able to adapt their stiffness to the driving conditions and requirements. Soft engine mounts improve comfort, as they provide more effective decoupling of noise and vibration. However, handling and agility benefit from a generally stiffer mount set-up. These measures enhance the vehicle’s precision when driven dynamically. For example, the steering response and feedback are even more direct.

Safety of the highest calibre

The Coupé also offers a supreme level of safety. It comes as standard with the ATTENTION ASSIST drowsiness detection system and COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS, which helps to prevent rear-end collisions. Many other optional assistance systems are available to increase both comfort and safety.

Inspired by Motorsport

The new Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupé and C 63 S Coupé are also available as “Edition 1” special models from market launch. The extraordinary combination of exclusive design and equipment characteristics is inspired by the optical appearance of future Mercedes-AMG racing coupés which will compete at the popular DTM series in 2016.

Two exterior designs address different customer wishes. The first variant, available exclusively for the S-Model is particularly striking: The colour scheme in designo Magno Selenite Grey matt paint with yellow film coating borrows the look of the International Motor Show launch version of the 2016 C 63 DTM and thus highlights its proximity to motor sport. Yellow sport stripes adorn the engine bonnet, roof, boot lid as well as the side lines above the rocker panels.

With yellow painted rim flanges, the extremely light, matt black AMG Performance forged wheels in 5 double-spoke design also set a distinctive accent. Size 9.0J x 19 with 255\/35 R 19 tyres are used at the front, 10.5J x 20 with 285\/30 R 20 tyres at the rear. The custom sports tyres offer a tangibly enhanced level of traction on dry roads. The C 63 S Coupé Edition 1 is equipped with AMG ceramic high-performance compound brake system offering the ultimate deceleration values and lower unsprung mass, thus increasing performance on the racetrack.

The exterior of the second Edition 1 variant is more restrained. The sport stripes are rendered in graphite grey matt and the rim flanges of the matt black forged wheels have a high-sheen cross-spoke design.

The genuine racing feel continues in the interior. The AMG Performance seats are upholstered in Nappa leather, including the colour yellow in the contrast stitching of the specific diamond pattern. In addition, the more sharply-contoured seat shape enhances lateral support, particularly in curves taken at high speed. Yellow contrast stitching is also found in the door centre panels, arm rests, the steering wheel rim as well as the beltline. Further yellow accents adorn the instrument cluster, the AMG-specific analogue in IWC design and the floor mats. With the Performance steering wheel of DINAMICA microfibre featuring a flattened bottom, the driver always has the C 63 Coupé securely under control. The middle section trim in matt carbon colour also gives the unmistakable signal of what the Edition 1 is about: Uncompromising dynamics at the highest level.. Mercedes B 250 adds 4MATIC AWD. Ah, the Mercedes-Benz B 250.   
 

                            I still don’t quite know what to call it - a hatchback, tall wagon or multipurpose vehicle (MPV). Or maybe even a mini minivan, considering its two-box architecture.    
 

                            I guess I could toe the party line and go along with Mercedes-Benz’s “compact sport tourer” label but, whatever you call it, the Mercedes-Benz B 250 certainly seems to be the oddball in the lineup at first, unique in an upper class stable of sedans, coupes and SUVs.   
 

                            But it’s not really all that out of place, as the most affordable gateway into the Mercedes family of products. It’s a good fit, really, for Canadians who can still be cash conscious even when moving up to a prestige brand.    
 

                            Which is why Mercedes-Benz Canada fought so hard to get the B-Class while the American division tended to pooh-pooh this lower entry level.   
 

                            A few years ago, the B-Class got some overdue attention, jazzing up its jellybean blandness with angular accent lines and stronger familial styling cues.    
 

                            The front face now features a wide matte black diamond grille with silver twin louvres above a sporty, soft-nose front bumper, bracketed by standard halogen headlamps with integral LED daylight running lamps (DRLs).    
 

                            Following those stronger accent lines along the side profile, the B 250’s bodywork tails to a rear treatment that includes a standard roof spoiler, a wide hatch and chrome trim pieces complementing twin exhaust outlets.   
 

                            It’s a more aggressive, more stylish package but there were even more important changes made under the skin.   
 

                            For Canada, a 2.0-litre 16-valve DOHC turbocharged engine, making 208 hp at 5,500 rpm and 258 lb\/ft of torque anywhere from 1,200 - 4,000 rpm, replaced the former B 200’s older 2.0-litre two engine combo - a standard 134 hp motor and an optional 190 hp turbo.    
 

                            The new turbo engine was mated to a 7G-DCT (seven-speed dual clutch transmission) and along with the extra power it delivered improved fuel economy and reduced emissions.   
 

                            For the 2015 model year, Mercedes-Benz Canada has evolved this potent B 250 package further with standard heated seats, a new audio interface and added choices in upholstery, paint and trim choices.   
 

                            But, more significantly, they have added a new 4MATIC all-wheel-drive model, always a popular option for Canadians looking for winter weather safety and security.   
 

                            The B 250 4MATIC, tested here, makes the B-Class a truly viable contender for consumer attention. It uses an all-wheel-drive system that will shift variable amounts of power from the front axle to the rear, activated, as Mercedes puts it, “as often as necessary and as seldom as possible”.   
 

                            Under normal cruising conditions, the B 250 4MATIC operates in a simple, fuel-efficient front-wheel-drive mode. But sensors monitoring vehicle performance and road conditions can divert torque to the rear to the tune of an up to 50\/50 split in the case of, for example, full acceleration, high speed cornering or loss of front traction.   
 

                            Life is full of tradeoffs so, along with the added price premium ($2,200) for the 4MATIC, you’d expect some kind of penalty for the extra bulk and weight of an all-wheel-drive system (+40 kg). But the 4MATIC model, with better traction, actually has a slightly quicker acceleration time (0-100 km\/h in 6.7 sec) than the lighter front wheel drive version (0-100 km\/h in 6.8 sec).   
 

                            The B 250 4MATIC system works seamlessly in conjunction with the 7G-DCT automatic, offering three driving programs - Economy, Sport and Manual.    
 

                            And the powertrain benefits from the B 250’s other inherent driving technologies - an electronic stability program (ESP) and the 4ETS dynamic handling control system that will brake individual wheels to keep you on the straight and narrow.   
 

                            I found the initial acceleration to be slightly sluggish, especially in the default Economy mode but the turbo engine hauls up to speed nicely, revving at a sedate 2,000 rpm on the highway with plenty of oomph left for passing.    
 

                            And there’s always Sport mode . . .   
 

                            The 2015 B 250 4MATIC is rated at 10\/7.5L\/100km (city\/hwy) compared to the regular B 250 front-wheel-drive’s 9.2\/6.6L\/100km. My real world results with the 4MATIC model, mostly in Economy mode and using the auto stop\/start system, averaged out to 9.8L\/100km (comb).   
 

                            Inside, my B 250 4MATIC tester complemented roomy practical tall wagon spaciousness and upright seating with Cranberry Red Leather upholstery, Dark Ash wood trim, rich textures, metallic highlights and a full suite of standard equipment.    
 

                            And in this case, that list of standard features was also bolstered by everything from a panoramic sunroof to a rear view camera, passive blind spot assist, COMAND navigation system, even funky front seatback tray tables, for Pete’s sake.   
 

                            It works out to more than $8,000 worth of packages and options, designed to impress the press, I guess but probably, at $41,950, getting a little too pricey a total for buyers staying within this compact entry class.   
 

                            But with customers picking and choosing from among those many offered extras, the 2015 B 250 4MATIC ($33,500) certainly starts out as the most affordable entry level compact in the lineup, listing for less than the two other vehicles that share the same engine and A-Class platform parts - the CLA 250 4MATIC four-door Coupe ($36,800) and the GLA 250 4MATIC crossover ute ($37,200).   
 

                            Which makes the 2015 B 250 worth a closer look.    
 

                            And with the added driving security of Mercedes-Benz’s 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, also definitely worth a test drive.

by Chirag Moroon September 28, 2015No Comments       
We knew that the Volkswagen diesel scandal will have a profound impact on the global automotive industry. And the first company it has effected is Mercedes-Benz.
Diesel engines are complicated and very expensive
In 1936, Mercedes-Benz launched the first diesel powered car in the world. It was the Mercedes-Benz 260 D. It used a 2545cc, 4 cylinder engine producing 45 bhp. Top speed was 95 kmph. The engine used the Bosch diesel fuel injection system. Mercedes-Benz have been associated with diesels since then. In India, most of the cars sold in the premium luxury segment are the diesel cars.
Diesel engines are known for their torque output and high fuel efficiency. But on the downside, they are extremely complex and very expensive. The emissions released are also very high. The additives used to reduce particulate matter are very costly. With strictening regulations, it is becoming tough for automobile manufacturers to meet the regulations. However, diesels are extremely popular all over the world, expect is the United States. Hence, till now, manufacturers were always looking for new technologies to better the performance and and reduce emissions at the same time even if it is a little expensive.
Mercedes-Benz will be slowly replacing all their diesel cars with electric hybrid cars. Hybrid cars are coming more and more popular and now almost all manufacturers are developing electric hybrids. They are more efficient and less expensive to build than the diesel cars. Almost all concept cars coming out these days are plug-in hybrids. Diesel concept cars have become very rare now. These new generation engines seem to be the way out in meeting the stringent emission regulations.
It remains to be seen how this will impact the Indian market where diesels are very popular, especially in the premium luxury segment. BMW has even removed the petrol engine from the 1-series, 3-series, 5-series and the 6-series.
What are your thoughts on what could be the future of engines in the wake of tough emission regulations?
Pug-in hybrids seem to be the way out to meet the strict emission regulations

Barcelona\/Spain - Good news in the anniversary year of the large vans of Mercedes-Benz Vans: With the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter in its portfolio, the Falck Group, the world's largest private provider of ambulance services, has won a tender by the region of Catalonia and prevailed against numerous competitors. From this autumn and for the next six years, more than 340 Sprinter will guarantee mobile emergency and safe patient transport services in three districts in the Catalan metropolis of Barcelona. The high standards set by the Falck Group for the safety of their patients and the advanced technology of their ambulances have proved persuasive. More than two million people live within the operating area. Mercedes-Benz Sprinter outstandingly equipped for everyday emergency operations The 344 Sprinter 313 CDI and 316 CDI for the Falck Group are all equipped with 7G-TRONIC PLUS. This automatic transmission ensures the smooth transfer of power, while at the same time reducing fuel consumption and keeping emissions low - important arguments in favour of the 
 
Mercedes-Benz Sprinter for use by ambulance services. 
 
120 of the 344 Sprinter panel vans will be equipped with medical equipment and classified as emergency ambulances according to the EN 1789 European standard. 224 Sprinter will be converted to patient transport ambulances by Spanish bodybuilders. Falck and the Sprinter: a smooth-running rescue team In 19 countries the Falck Group, a private company based in Copenhagen, takes care of mobile ambulance services for local populations on behalf of the public authorities. In Denmark the company has been successfully using the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter as an ambulance for several years now. In 2013 Falck strengthened its activities in Germany by a merger with the Hamburg-based emergency service G.A.R.D. - which likewise uses a fleet of ambulances based on the Sprinter. 
 
Anniversary year: 20 years of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 
 
For 20 years now the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter has been setting the benchmark in the 3.5 t van segment, meeting the needs of customers. The first 500 Sprinter left the production lines in Duesseldorf in January 1995. In 2014 record sales of 186 000 unites were achieved.. Mercedes-AMG 12 Cylinder Halo Car. With increasingly stringent regulations on fuel economy and emissions, it looks like the future is bleak for monstrous eight, ten, and twelve cylinder engines. It seems that everyone is downsizing their engines and strapping on turbochargers, which makes sense if manufacturers want to meet these regulations. But fret not, young automotive enthusiast! Mercedes-Benz believes that there is still a place for engines with a dozen cylinders in today’s ever-more “green” society.

In a recent conversation with Autoblog, a Mercedes-AMG product planner in Austria uncovered that there is a new halo car in development, which will be positioned above the current AMG halo car, the AMG GT . Currently, the AMG GT makes do with a twin-turbo 4.0L V8 engine, that in itself represented Mercedes’ commitment to the aforementioned downsizing trend as it replaced the gloriously naturally aspirated 6.2L V8 M159 engine from the SLS AMG.

It is good to note that Mercedes-Benz still makes V12 engines as an option on some of their most prominent models. As it stands, the twin-turbo 6.0L V12 M275 engine is reserved for the -65 AMG models for the S (sedan and coupe) and Sl models, as well as the S600 Maybach model. That engine is rated at 604 hp and a monstrous 738 lb ft of torque. They also supply the engine used in the Pagani Huayra, also a twin-turbo 6.0L V12, but with 720 hp and 740 lb ft of torque. 
 
This new halo car will most likely have some sort of boost mechanism, whether it be with electric motors or forced induction, or possibly even both, as a purely naturally aspirated engine will not be feasible in terms of emissions and fuel economy. As demonstrated by Ferrari, McLaren, and Porsche, a hybrid system of a combustion engine and electric power is very effective at going fast. However, don’t expect this new halo car to show itself in the near future. The AMG GT is set to be the halo car for a little bit, with new variants such as the forthcoming Black Series coming out soon. Either way, it’s a sigh of relief that Mercedes sees the importance of keeping twelve cylinder engines around…even if it’s for just a bit longer.

         973.496.3916 PR@avisbudget.com. Can China rescue Europe's heritage marques?. Story highlights  350,000 people attended this year's Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung in Frankfurt, Germany  Many were interested in auto developments in China  China represents the largest automotive market and producer in the world     
And everyone was there with China on its mind. Already representing the largest automotive market -- and producer -- in the world with a growth potential that dwarfs that of America, Europe and Japan combined, China is where the automakers are understandably looking. 
 
Just last year vehicle production in China reached nearly 24-million units, making it the largest output by any nation at any time in history. These staggering numbers combined with exponential growth estimates from both a domestic production and import standpoint make China the focus of the future. 
 
Not only that but China's increased efforts to combat excessive pollution (Beijing and Shanghai already have mandatory Euro III emission standards) and offset energy challenges have resulted in China also placing a real focus on ever more efficient gasoline-powered and hybrid and electric cars. 
 
With stricter standards, a considerable domestic output, a rising middle class, giant growth potential and vast private investment, China is also looking outside its borders. 
 
No longer content to invite the major automakers to set up shop in China (Chrysler, VW, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Honda, BMW and many more all have joint-venture manufacturing in China), the Chinese are actively going abroad to purchase technology, IP and manufacturing platforms. 
 
Fisker, for example, the California-based luxury sports hybrid that went out of business, was recently bought by a Chinese firm. So too was Segway, the little battery-powered personal transporter. At nearly every end of the spectrum, from electric urban ""scooters"" to heavy equipment, the Chinese are acquiring or partnering at an accelerated rate. 
 
An interesting example of this is Borgward. Formerly a Bremen-based German automobile manufacturer, Borgward created trucks and ""affordable premium"" cars for about 30 years from the late 1920s to the early 1960s. In fact, at one point, in the 1950s, Borgward was the third largest automaker in Germany. Now after a half-century hiatus Borgward is back, having been reborn with the help of Chinese investors and is unveiling its first model this year. 
 
Representing the new global paradigm, Borgward is considered a German company as its products are designed at its headquarters in Germany but manufactured in China. While some critics refer to this as a Chinese company veiled as German, the same could be said of most leading brands today whether their products are made in China or whether their companies are controlled by the Chinese or both. 
 
Examples include Apple, whose products are designed in California but made in China, MG and Rover automobiles that are made in Britain but controlled by Chinese, and divisions of IBM and Motorola that are both owned and manufactured by the Chinese. 
 
These critiques, however, don't seem to affect the optimistic Borgward group headed by CEO Ulrich Walker and his team of German directors. After all, they may be revealing their new model here in Europe but their target is unabashedly Asia. 
 
Adhering to Borgward's traditional philosophy of ""affordable premium"" and capitalizing on China's insatiable appetite for SUVs, Borgward is going after China's rapidly rising middle class with, initially, a single model -- the BX7 hybrid. Similar in many respects to Audi's Q5 hybrid, Borgward's BX7 is an attractive crossover-style vehicle packed with amenities, offering impressive performance and positioned more affordably than rivals. 
 
What's most newsworthy, however, is Borgward's stated goal of producing an incredible 800,000 units by the year 2020. While this number may seem extraordinary, given the projections in China and the fact that Borgward is controlled by China's Foton group (already manufacturers of an array of automobiles in a joint venture with Daimler) this number -- over three-quarters of a million vehicles in just four years -- may actually be attainable. 
 
So while the rock stars of this year's IAA were wowing the crowds with sensational products and shows, like Mercedes-Benz whose astounding concept car was unveiled in a manner rivaling that of a Las Vegas production (complete with DJs, lasers, high-tech choreography and theatrics on an epic scale), brands like Borgward were quietly and confidently announcing their plans for the future. Though their products may not cause the crowds to gasp, in Borgward's case it represents a revival of epic, if uniquely Eastern, proportions.. Adrian Newey considering electric power for Red Bull road car. Red Bull tech chief looks to electric powertrains for his road car project as AMG moves to be involved Adrian Newey’s road car could be launched as a pure electric model, with hybrid spin-offs set to follow after the initial launch in around 2018. While insiders continue to insist that the Red Bull F1 team’s chief technical officer has yet to get the green light to develop the car beyond the concept stage, latest reports suggest that he is spending an increasing amount of time on the project, on which he is working with Aston Martin. Newey has a free role within Red Bull Technologies to work on projects of his choosing. Earlier this year he was said to be taking an active interest in working with Ben Ainslie Racing on its America’s Cup sailing project, but insiders have suggested that the road car has since taken priority. Although Newey is still said to be working on various concepts for his first production car, he is reported only to be interested in undertaking the project if he can break new ground in terms of advancing technology and driver involvement. He is said to view the impact made by the McLaren F1, designed by Gordon Murray and launched in 1994, as his inspiration on both measures. As such, launching a hybrid hypercar four years after the McLaren P1, LaFerrari and Porsche 918 Spyder were sold out is reported to hold little appeal for Newey. Instead, he is said to be considering how to harness the potential benefits of electric power using the latest technologies, thereby potentially building an era-defining all-electric supercar. However, sources suggest that Aston Martin shareholder Mercedes-Benz wants to be involved in the project, both to create a connection with Red Bull’s younger audience and to have a technical involvement in what could be a landmark product. As such, it is said to be pushing for its performance arm, AMG, to work with Newey and for the car to be built with the potential to be run as a hybrid post-launch, potentially combining a V8 petrol engine with electric propulsion, as well as a pure electric model. Mercedes R&D boss Thomas Weber recently revealed to Autocar that AMG was already working on hybrid powertrains for 2020. Weber cautioned that AMG’s customers weren’t yet ready to pay more for the technology but said the increasing pressure to reduce emissions meant that the manufacturer had to develop hybrid powertrains that changed perceptions. “In our development department, we are already planning for the time when we will have to offer something special,” he said. Newey stepped back from his F1 involvement at the start of the year, with a road car project rumoured to be among his plans. He is understood to have begun collaborative work with Aston Martin at about the same time, and insiders describe the embryonic project as ""ongoing, with no certainty of reaching fruition"". However, as well as using Aston Martin’s road car engineering resources, Newey is understood to have worked with the firm’s design team, suggesting that the project is both well advanced and that the car is likely to be emphasise aerodynamic performance. Plans for Newey to launch his own road car were first revealed in July of this year. Speaking to Autocar at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in June, Red Bull Racing boss Christian Horner reiterated that launching a Red Bull road car was inevitable. He told Autocar: “It’s something that Adrian is keen to do as a legacy project. At the moment our focus is on being a Formula 1 constructor, but as we see more technology cross over with the road car market, it’s something that will organically grow.” It is not known whether Renault's decision to renegotiate its contract with the Red Bull F1 team with a view to ending supply of customer engines will have any impact on the project. Speaking to Autocar at the Frankfurt motor show, Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said both parties were looking to end their current contract at the end of this season. Rumours are currently rife that Mercedes-Benz may step in to fill the breach left by Renault to supply engines.

Mercedes-AMG G 63 Edition designo nightblack magno All Mercedes-Benz G-Class models now offer up to 16 percent more power and up to 17 percent lower fuel consumption. The range includes the G 500 with a new, powerful 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine. All engines are compliant with the latest Euro 6 emissions standard. A new suspension setup together with more sensitive ESP® control results in increased driving stability, safety and road comfort. The exterior and interior have also been given an upgrade. The exclusive AMG EDITION 463 and the G 500 4x42 are also being launched. Mercedes-AMG G 63, AMG EDITION 463, polarwhite Mercedes-Benz's classic off-roader is beginning a new chapter in a success story that spans more than 35 years. With its continuously improved technology and high-class equipment specification, this all-terrain icon has consistently satisfied the highest expectations of off-road fans. True to this tradition, a new 4.0-litre directly injected V8 biturbo engine is now celebrating its world premiere in the G‑Class. 8-cylinder biturbo developed by Mercedes-AMG The new 8-cylinder powerplant in the G 500 can point to an exclusive heritage. It is based on the new generation of V8 engines developed by Mercedes-AMG that have already coaxed exceptional levels of performance out of the Mercedes-AMG GT and Mercedes-AMG C 63. For use in the G-Class, the V8 has been modified to deliver 310 kW (422 hp) with torque of 610 Nm. Other standout attributes include a spontaneous response and high tractive power made possible, for example, by two turbochargers, which instead of being configured on the outside of the cylinder banks, are arranged between them in the V – the so-called ""hot inside V"". This layout allows a compact design, optimal response and low exhaust emissions. High efficiency is ensured by Mercedes‑Benz's use of piezo direct petrol injection with spray-guided combustion. Maximum strength with lowest possible weight is guaranteed by the aluminium crankcase of the V8 engine. The cylinder bore surfaces feature Daimler's NANOSLIDE® technology, which makes them twice as hard as conventional cast-iron liners. This minimises both internal friction and fuel demand. Technical data of the G 500 Cylinders V8 Cylinder angle 90 degrees Valves per cylinder 4 Displacement 3982 cc Bore x stroke 83.0 x 92.0 mm Cylinder spacing 90 mm Compression ratio 10.5:1 Output 310 kW (422 hp) at 5250 to 5500 rpm Torque 610 Nm at 2250 to 4750 rpm Compared with the previous 5.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 unit, the new 8-cylinder biturbo engine puts out 25 kW (35 hp) more power and 80 newton metres more torque. Turbocharging results in maximum power and torque being delivered at lower engine speeds, this being to the benefit of not just tractive power and performance, but also fuel economy. The new G 500 accelerates to 100 km\/h in 5.9 seconds (previously: 6.1 seconds) and has a combined NEDC consumption of 12.3 litres per 100 kilometres (previously: 14.9 l\/100 km). More power, lower fuel consumption The engines in the other G-Class models have likewise been upgraded: The G 350 d benefits from a hike in output from 155 kW (211 hp) to 180 kW (245 hp), with its torque climbing from 540 to 600 Nm. The G 350 d now accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 8.8 seconds instead of the previous 9.1 seconds. The combined NEDC consumption drops from 11.2 litres per 100 kilometres to 9.9 l\/100 km. The AMG G 63 now delivers 420 kW (571 hp) instead of 400 kW (544 hp) with torque of 760 Nm. Instead of 450 kW (612 hp), the 12-cylinder powerplant in the AMG G 65 now puts out 463 kW (630 hp) with torque of 1000 Nm. The G 350 d, G 500 and AMG G 63 are equipped as standard with an ECO start\/stop function that reduces fuel consumption and emissions by switching off the engine when the vehicle is at rest, e.g. in a traffic jam or at traffic lights.
As is typical of the G-Class, the new models retain the familiar sturdy basis of body and ladder-type frame, which still offers generous reserves to cope with the increased power. Also retained is the unrivalled off-road performance with permanent all-wheel drive, low-range gearbox and three differential locks that can be engaged\/disengaged while on the move. Optimised ESP®, optionally available adaptive damping system for G 500 The standard suspension setup has been revised with optimised shock absorbers for improved control of body movements and even greater on-road ride comfort.  An adapted ESP® setup makes enhanced driving dynamics possible and, as a result, increased driving stability and road safety. Optimisations to ASR and ABS result in improved traction while shortening the stopping distance when braking. The front-axle load capacity has been raised by 100 kg to 1550 kg. In addition, the G 500 is optionally available with a new adaptive damping system with Sport and Comfort modes. This provides a significantly more agile on-road performance in Sport mode with undiminished off-road capability while at the same time reducing the typical SUV roll in corners. As already familiar from the AMG variants, the 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission in the G 350 d and G 500 models now also features a manual transmission mode. This mode, which can be conveniently activated by pressing the ""M"" button, allows the driver to savour the high available torque and to use the steering-wheel shift paddles to decide just when to change gear. Enhanced inside and out Visually, the new G 350 d and G 500 models are especially easy to identify by their restyled bumpers and now standard flared wheel arches in the vehicle colour. The G 350 d now also comes as standard with 45.7 cm (18-inch) five-spoke light-alloy wheels. On the inside, the G 350 d and G 500 feature an eye-catching instrument cluster in two-tube look with 11.4 cm multifunction display and redesigned pointers and dials. The two AMG models, too, sport a redesigned instrument cluster. New choice of colours A new Colour package is available for customers wishing to give their AMG G-Class an even more personal look. There are exclusive exterior paint finishes in solar beam, tomato red, alien green, sunset beam and galactic beam. Detachable parts such as mirrors, front and rear bumpers, wheel arch extensions, the ring around the spare wheel cover as well as the roof are painted in obsidian black. The interior topstitching is colour-matched to the paintwork. New AMG EDITION 463 special model: visible dynamics With the new EDITION 463 special model, Mercedes-AMG is giving the G 63 and G 65 an impressive sporty look. The exquisite interior specification includes a two-tone instrument panel, two-tone seats in high-quality designo leather with side bolsters in carbon-look leather and contrasting topstitching, seat and door centre panels in a diamond look, carbon-fibre trim and door pulls in nappa leather. On the outside, a stainless steel underguard, AMG sport stripes along the sides and a protective-strip insert in black aluminium look underscore both the dynamics and exclusivity of the special model. The G 63 is fitted with exclusive 53.3 cm (21-inch) 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels in matt black with high-sheen spokes and 295\/40 R 21 wide-base tyres. The G 65 has an exquisite look with identically sized, ceramically polished 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels. The Mercedes-Benz G 500 4x42 goes into series production Having proved hugely popular with many customers, the G 500 4x42 show car is set to enter series production. In the superlative-studded history of the G-Class, the G 500 4x42 is the new highlight in the model range. The technical package consists of the all-wheel-drive powertrain including portal axles and the new 4-litre V8 twin-turbo engine with an output of 310 kW (422 hp). Also new is the chassis with dual spring\/damper struts and adjustable damping. In the interior of the G 500 4x42, occupants enjoy comfort and an ambience on a par with a luxury saloon. In view of the key data for the chassis and powertrain, it seems more than logical that the off-road world starts for the G 500 4x42 where other vehicles give up. The new ""G"" also puts in an absolutely convincing performance on the asphalt. Owing to the considerably wider track of the portal axles compared with the series-production car (+264 mm), the large 22-inch 325\/55 R 22-sized wheels and the adjustable damping with its Sport mode, the enhanced G-Class drives through bends so dynamically that the occupants feel as though they are in a sports car rather than a cross-country vehicle. This also applies to outings on unsurfaced slopes or snow-bound roads, in which case the performance of a high-powered rally car kicks in. The G 500 4x42 will be in Mercedes-Benz dealer showrooms from December 2015, with all other new G-Class models being available from September 2015.

Mercedes-Benz is adding a Coupé to its C-Class family. Athletic and sporty, the vivid, sensual design of the new Coupé cuts a fine figure on the road and embodies modern luxury. At the same time, its interior raises elegance and style to a sporty level. 
 

 
A dynamically configured chassis, with optional air suspension, forms the basis for a high level of suspension comfort, low road roar and tyre vibration, agile handling, and driving pleasure. Lightweight construction to reduce weight, excellent aerodynamics and high-performance yet efficient engines likewise contribute to this. New assistance systems provide safety of the very highest calibre. With its high-class appeal and generous interior, the new C-Class Coupé sets new standards in its segment. It arrives in December 2015. 
 
“Our new C-Class Coupé continues the philosophy of our exciting coupés. It combines thrilling design with agile sportiness and modern luxury. The C-Class Coupé therefore clearly pledges itself to stylish driving enjoyment,” states Prof. Dr. Thomas Weber, member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. 
 
As the sportiest variant of the C-Class, the Coupé displays its driving enjoyment-oriented character in an emotive and at the same time formally distinct design. A sportily striking front section featuring diamond radiator grille and long bonnet – the new Coupé is 60 millimetres longer than its predecessor between the firewall and front axle alone – gives way to a low greenhouse whose lines flow into a bold and powerful-looking rear end incorporating the Mercedes coupé genes. A high beltline and frameless doors with free-standing exterior mirrors underscore the sporty character. 
 
Clean lines and sensually arranged surfaces structure the side sections into vivid light and shadow effects. One particular highlight is the long drawn-out dropping line typical of a coupé. In contrast to the C-Class Saloon, the dropping line extends further past the rear wheel arch. To underscore the Coupé’s sporty disposition, the suspension is 15 millimetres lower than that of the Saloon, making it a very sporty proposition when combined with the standard 17-inch tyres. 
 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe Interior: generous, dynamic, exquisite  
The interior is likewise a statement of the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy and combines emotion with intelligence. Although it exudes athletic and youthful charm, it has grown in maturity. Driver and passengers enjoy an ambience that leans toward the interior of the C-Class Saloon yet raises it to a new, sporty level. Flowing forms characterise the centre console as well as the door and rear side panelling, which smoothly merge into one another to emphasise the coupé character. The individually designed trim elements underscore the sporty character of the interior. A seating system including integral sports seats designed specifically for the Coupé offers sporty comfort. Plus there is an automatic belt feeder for added convenience. The choice of materials and the finish have a hand-crafted feel with high-class appeal and deliver a new take on modern luxury: sportiness without compromising on comfort and exquisite style. 
 
The unique position of the new C-Class Coupé is emphasised by the special upholstery colour combinations: saddle brown, porcelain and – in the Edition 1 – nut brown\/black with turquoise topstitching. 
 
With an 80 millimetre longer wheelbase, the C-Class Coupé is 95 millimetres longer and 40 millimetres wider. The increased vehicle volume above all creates more spaciousness for the driver and front passenger. There is more shoulder room, elbow room and headroom in all seats.

 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe Individual highlights  
The Coupé features a wealth of equipment as standard. The AMG Line is available as an alternative to further underline the dynamism of the Coupé. It differs by virtue of exterior features such as special bumpers and sills featuring AMG bodystyling, a diamond radiator grille with pins in chrome and 18-inch AMG light-alloy wheels. Interior highlights of the AMG Line include sportily exclusive touches such as upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather\/DINAMICA microfibre in black with contrasting topstitching, a multifunction sports steering wheel with flattened bottom section and AMG sports pedals. The trim in open-pore black ash, combined with aluminium in the dashboard and the doors, emphasises the look. 
 
Another eye-catching feature is the optional Interior Chrome package featuring numerous highlights shrouded in silver chrome, including the instrument cluster, the air vents and the door openers. 
 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe Suspension – sportily agile and comfortable  
The suspension offers a high level of comfort with low road roar and tyre vibration whilst ensuring agile driving dynamics – the basis for driving enjoyment. 
 
A new 4-link front axle with wheel suspension decoupled from the spring strut plays a part in the agile handling characteristics. This enables sporty axle kinematics for plenty of grip and high lateral stability. As a result, the suspension responds more sensitively to steering movements and allows a sporty, agile driving style. Multi-link independent rear suspension with 5 links ensures excellent wheel location qualities and supreme straight-line stability. 
 
The Coupé comes with steel suspension as standard. There are two variants with selective damping system available in conjunction with this suspension, each of which is 15 millimetres lower than on the Saloon: 
  Comfortable AGILITY CONTROL suspension with a sporty character  Sports suspension with tauter springing and damping including Sports Direct-Steer system for even more agile handling   Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe Air suspension  
The Coupé comes with the option of AIRMATIC air suspension on the front and rear axle. Its electronically controlled, continuously adjustable damping on the front and rear axle ensures outstanding road roar and tyre vibration characteristics in every situation and gives the driver the option of selecting the desired driving style: sporty, comfortable or consumption-optimised. To this end, the driver can select one of five driving modes using the DYNAMIC SELECT Switch: “ECO”, “Comfort”, “Sport”, “Sport +” and “Individual”. Selecting “Individual” allows the driver to customise the vehicle settings. AIRMATIC also features all-round self-levelling for excellent ride comfort even with the vehicle loaded. 
 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe Efficient and lively engines  
Powerful and efficient four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines with ECO start\/stop function provide for sporty performance and driving pleasure. All are compliant with the Euro 6 emissions standard. Compared with the predecessor they consume up to 20 percent less fuel. 
 
There are initially four petrol engines available for the Coupé. The power spectrum ranges from the 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine in the C 180 with 115 kW\/156 hp to the two-litre C 200 (135 kW\/184 hp) and C 250 (155 kW\/211 hp) models and the C 300, likewise with a displacement of two litres but with an output of 180 kW\/245 hp. 
 
The two diesel models are equipped with an enhanced four-cylinder unit developing 125 kW (170 hp) or 150 kW (204 hp) and feature ecofriendly SCR technology (Selective Catalytic Reduction) for exhaust gas aftertreatment. 
 
Power is sent to the road via either a 6-speed manual transmission, the 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission or the new 9-speed 9G-TRONIC.

 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe Lighter, stiffer and stronger  
Intelligent lightweight construction with a higher proportion of aluminium helps make the Coupé lighter than its predecessor. Light-alloy components include the wings, bonnet and boot lid. At the same time, the body is now much stiffer and stronger thanks to the use of high-strength materials, which has a positive effect on not only driving dynamics and noise levels but also crash safety. The Coupé therefore follows a Mercedes-Benz tradition in not only meeting all current national and international laws, but also all rating requirements as well as the more stringent internal Mercedes-Benz safety requirements, which are based on what actually happens in real-life accidents. 
 Through the wind  
Mercedes-Benz is setting the pace in the field of aerodynamics and delivers cars with the best drag coefficients (Cd values) in almost all vehicle classes. The new C‑Class Coupé boasts a Cd value of 0.26. This leading figure pays off above all when driving on country roads and motorways as wind resistance is greater than other forms of driving resistance at speeds above 70 km\/h. 
 
Safe semi-autonomous driving to reduce stress 
 
There are several safety and assistance systems based on the Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive concept to choose from. ATTENTION ASSIST with adjustable sensitivity, which can warn the driver of inattentiveness and drowsiness, is included as standard. Further standard equipment includes COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS, which features an acoustic warning for the driver at speeds above 7 km\/h and Adaptive Brake Assist to help avoid collisions by boosting the braking effect in line with the current situation. When a danger of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to 200 km\/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles or, in the best-case scenario, even avoiding the collision altogether. At speeds of up to 50 km\/h the system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles, and is thus able to help prevent rear-end collisions at up to 40 km\/h. 
 
New assistance systems with substantially enhanced functions are optionally available, combining data from various sensor technologies such as radar sensors and a stereo camera as part of the Intelligent Drive concept to enhance comfort and safety: 
  DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot is an adaptive cruise control system that can adjust the speed of the vehicle in line with a slower-moving vehicle ahead in a speed range from 0 to 200 km\/h if required. Likewise available from 0 to 200 km\/h, steering intervention helps the driver stay in lane. And at speeds below 130 km\/h, for example in traffic jams or when driving bumper to bumper, the system can follow the vehicle ahead even where there are no or unclear lane markings, thus enabling the driver to safety and comfortably follow the flow of traffic.  As well as vehicles ahead and stationary vehicles, the BAS PLUS Brake Assist System can also detect crossing traffic and boost the braking force if the driver fails to apply the brakes sufficiently; in addition to slower-moving, stopping and stationary vehicles, the PRE-SAFE® Brake can even detect pedestrians and brake autonomously if the driver fails to react, thus preventing accidents up to 50 km\/h and mitigating the severity of collisions at speeds of up to 72 km\/h. In flowing traffic the PRE-SAFE® Brake provides assistance according to the same mode of operation throughout the speed range from 7 to 200 km\/h.  Enhanced Active Lane Keeping Assist can now also prevent the vehicle from unintentionally drifting out of lane by applying the brakes on one side when the lane markings are solid or broken and there is a risk of collision, e.g. as a result of vehicles overtaking at high speed, parallel traffic or even oncoming traffic.  PRE-SAFE® PLUS extends the Intelligent Drive functions to take account of imminent rear impacts. It warns the following traffic by activating the rear hazard warning lights at increased frequency and initiating preventive PRE‑SAFE® occupant protection measures such as the reversible belt tensioner immediately prior to the impact. If the vehicle is stationary, the brakes are locked to reduce the forward jolt, which reduces the forces acting on the occupants and the risk of secondary collisions.   The numerous assistance systems also include   Active Parking Assist, which enables semi-automated parking with active steering and brake intervention in both parallel and end-on parking spaces  A 360° camera which is able to show the vehicle and its surroundings from various perspectives, including a virtual bird’s-eye view, thus assisting with parking and manoeuvring  Camera and navigation-based Traffic Sign Assist with wrong-way warning function, which warns of speed limits and also alerts the driver to the start and end of no-overtaking zones and gives the driver a visual and audible warning if no-entry signs are detected  Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus, which allows the high-beam headlamps to be kept on permanently without dazzling traffic by masking out other vehicles in the cone of light from the high-beam headlamps   Airbags for safety  
In addition to 3-point seat belts with pyrotechnical belt tensioning and belt-force limitation for driver, front passenger and rear passengers, numerous airbags serve to protect the vehicle’s occupants in an accident. These include: 
  Frontal protection systems: Adaptive front airbags for driver and front passenger, additionally with a kneebag on the driver’s side  Side protection systems: Thorax\/pelvisbags for driver and front passenger plus front and rear windowbags, with rear sidebags available as an option   Climate control with satellite navigation  
The air conditioning system in the new C-Class Coupé operates efficiently and ensures high air quality. As in the Saloon, it uses satellite navigation to detect tunnels. It therefore closes the air recirculation flap automatically when entering a tunnel and opens it again after exiting a tunnel. 
 Vibrant infotainment experience  
The new multimedia generation offers intuitive controls with visual animations and effects. Frontbass ensures a listening experience almost on a par with a concert hall – especially if the optionally available Burmester® sound system is specified. The Frontbass system uses the space within the cross-member and side member in the body structure as a resonance chamber for the bass speakers. 
 
The navigation system, which supplies the driver with precise traffic information in real time (Live Traffic Information), processes its contents interactively. Its features include an animated compass, a “Drive Show” with information for passengers similar to the on-screen presentations on board airliners and Google Maps displayed on the head unit. 
 Extensive networking even in the basic version  
A Bluetooth®-compatible mobile phone with data option is all it takes to make even the Audio 20 system internet-capable. This enables surfing the internet without restrictions when the vehicle is stationary. Mercedes-Benz Apps can be used while driving. Audio and video playback is possible from various sources. 
 
COMAND Online provides not only a larger display with a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels, it also allows digital TV\/radio reception and, in addition to many other features, offers fast hard-disc navigation, integral WLAN hotspot functionality and the LINGUATRONIC voice control system. The basic Audio 20 system as well as Audio 20 CD and COMAND Online all offer basic telephony as standard, which links up a mobile phone to the vehicle via a standardised Bluetooth® interface. 
 
Mercedes connect me: connected with the car 
 
Like other models, the new C-Class Coupé has an extensive range of free Standard Services and Remote Online Services available as part of the “Mercedes connect me” package. Standard Services include automatic emergency call (eCall), Accident Recovery, breakdown assistance and after-sales service. The Remote Online services (standard with COMAND online and usable free of charge for the first three years) allow access to vehicle information at all times, including the status of windows and doors, mileage, tyre pressures and other diagnostic data. There is also a Vehicle Tracker function, remote door locking and unlocking, and remote auxiliary heating activation and deactivation. 
 
The post The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe appeared first on Car Shows .. Daimler AG categorically denies any and all allegations of manipulation. STUTTGART, Germany , Sept. 25, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ --  In light of the ongoing assertions from the Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a non-government organisation, and the related speculation, Daimler AG once again clearly states that: 
We categorically deny the accusation of manipulating emission tests regarding our vehicles. A defeat device, a function which illegitimately reduces emissions during testing, has never been and will never be used at Daimler. This holds true for both diesel and petrol engines. Our engines meet and adhere to every legal requirement. In light of the written request by the DUH, which was sent to us this morning with a deadline to respond by 3:00 pm (CET) , and the seven questions they posed, we can confirm that none of the allegations apply to our vehicles. The technical programming of our engines adheres to all legal requirements. We have no knowledge of measurements that indicate our vehicles did not meet legally required standards. We actively support the work being done within Europe and Germany in order to develop new testing methods which measure emissions based on real driving conditions. We work closely and constructively with the responsible authorities in Germany , Europe and the United States and will willingly provide any vehicle for testing. 
We'd like to point out that we are evaluating our legal options pertaining to the approach taken and the public assertions made by the DUH.

SOURCE  Daimler Corporate Communications. Mercedes-Benz Denies it Cheated on Diesel Emissions Tests. Mercedes-Benz is the latest German automaker to be accused of cheating on diesel emissions tests. 



Lobby group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) has said that it has tests showing vehicles made by German automakers, including those from Daimler and Mercedes-Benz, significantly exceeded limits on nitrogen oxide emissions. In response, Daimler has released a statement saying “We sharply deny the allegation that we manipulated our cars during emissions tests. We never did and do not now use a defeat device.” 


The company added that it is unaware of any data that shows its vehicles emit more emissions than the legal limits and is willing to have any of its vehicles tested. 

Automakers with diesel engines have become the center of attention after Volkswagen admitted to using a defeat device to cheat emissions tests. The EPA alleges that Volkswagen TDI models emit anywhere from 10 to 40 times more nitrogen oxide than the legal limit. It is unclear whether U.S. federal regulators will force other automakers to have their vehicles tested to determine whether or not they did cheat.

Discuss this story on our Mercedes-Benz Forum. News about the Mercedes-Benz G-Class: The legend lives on. All Mercedes-Benz G-Class models now offer up to 16 percent more power and up to 17 percent lower fuel consumption. The range includes the G 500 with a new, powerful 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine. All engines are compliant with the latest Euro 6 emissions standard. A new suspension setup together with more sensitive ESP ® control results in increased driving stability, safety and road comfort. The exterior and interior have also been given an upgrade. The exclusive AMG EDITION 463 and the G 500 4x4 2 are also being launched. 
 
Mercedes-Benz's classic off-roader is beginning a new chapter in a success story that spans more than 35 years. With its continuously improved technology and high-class equipment specification, this all-terrain icon has consistently satisfied the highest expectations of off-road fans. True to this tradition, a new 4.0-litre directly injected V8 biturbo engine is now celebrating its world premiere in the G‑Class. 
 
8-cylinder biturbo developed by Mercedes-AMG 
 
The new 8-cylinder powerplant in the G 500 can point to an exclusive heritage. It is based on the new generation of V8 engines developed by Mercedes-AMG that have already coaxed exceptional levels of performance out of the Mercedes-AMG GT and Mercedes-AMG C 63. For use in the G-Class, the V8 has been modified to deliver 310 kW (422 hp) with torque of 610 Nm. Other standout attributes include a spontaneous response and high tractive power 
 
made possible, for example, by two turbochargers, which instead of being configured on the outside of the cylinder banks, are arranged between them in the V – the so-called ""hot inside V"". This layout allows a compact design, optimal response and low exhaust emissions. High efficiency is ensured by Mercedes‑Benz's use of piezo direct petrol injection with spray-guided combustion. Maximum strength with lowest possible weight is guaranteed by the aluminium crankcase of the V8 engine. The cylinder bore surfaces feature Daimler's NANOSLIDE ® technology, which makes them twice as hard as conventional cast-iron liners. This minimises both internal friction and fuel demand.

Compared with the previous 5.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 unit, the new 8-cylinder biturbo engine puts out 25 kW (35 hp) more power and 80 newton metres more torque. Turbocharging results in maximum power and torque being delivered at lower engine speeds, this being to the benefit of not just tractive power and performance, but also fuel economy. The new G 500 accelerates to 100 km\/h in 5.9 seconds (previously: 6.1 seconds) and has a combined NEDC consumption of 12.3 litres per 100 kilometres (previously: 14.9 l\/100 km). 
 
More power, lower fuel consumption 
 
The engines in the other G-Class models have likewise been upgraded: 
  
the G 350 d benefits from a hike in output from 155 kW (211 hp) to 180 kW (245 hp), with its torque climbing from 540 to 600 Nm. The G 350 d now accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 8.8 seconds instead of the previous 9.1 seconds. The combined NEDC consumption drops from 11.2 litres per 100 kilometres to 9.9 l\/100 km. 
  
The AMG G 63 now delivers 420 kW (571 hp) instead of 400 kW (544 hp) with torque of 760 Nm. 
  
Instead of 450 kW (612 hp), the 12-cylinder powerplant in the AMG G 65 now puts out 463 kW (630 hp) with torque of 1000 Nm. 

The G 350 d, G 500 and AMG G 63 are equipped as standard with an ECO start\/stop function that reduces fuel consumption and emissions by switching off the engine when the vehicle is at rest, e.g. in a traffic jam or at traffic lights. 
 
As is typical of the G-Class, the new models retain the familiar sturdy basis of body and ladder-type frame, which still offers generous reserves to cope with the increased power. Also retained is the unrivalled off-road performance with permanent all-wheel drive, low-range gearbox and three differential locks that can be engaged\/disengaged while on the move. 
 
Optimised ESP ® , optionally available adaptive damping system for G 500 
 
The standard suspension setup has been revised with optimised shock absorbers for improved control of body movements and even greater on-road ride comfort.  An adapted ESP ® setup makes enhanced driving dynamics possible and, as a result, increased driving stability and road safety. Optimisations to ASR and ABS result in improved traction while shortening the stopping distance when braking. The front-axle load capacity has been raised by 100 kg to 1550 kg. 
 
In addition, the G 500 is optionally available with a new adaptive damping system with Sport and Comfort modes. This provides a significantly more agile on-road performance in Sport mode with undiminished off-road capability while at the same time reducing the typical SUV roll in corners. As already familiar from the AMG variants, the 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission in the G 350 d and G 500 models now also features a manual transmission mode. This mode, which can be conveniently activated by pressing the ""M"" button, allows the driver to savour the high available torque and to use the steering-wheel shift paddles to decide just when to change gear. 
 
Enhanced inside and out 
 
Visually, the new G 350 d and G 500 models are especially easy to identify by their restyled bumpers and now standard flared wheel arches in the vehicle colour. The G 350 d now also comes as standard with 45.7 cm (18-inch) five-spoke light-alloy wheels. 
 
On the inside, the G 350 d and G 500 feature an eye-catching instrument cluster in two-tube look with 11.4 cm multifunction display and redesigned pointers and dials. The two AMG models, too, sport a redesigned instrument cluster. 
 
New choice of colours 
 
A new Colour package is available for customers wishing to give their AMG G-Class an even more personal look. There are exclusive exterior paint finishes in solar beam, tomato red, alien green, sunset beam and galactic beam. Detachable parts such as mirrors, front and rear bumpers, wheel arch extensions, the ring around the spare wheel cover as well as the roof are painted in obsidian black. The interior topstitching is colour-matched to the paintwork. 
 
New AMG EDITION 463 special model: visible dynamics 
 
With the new EDITION 463 special model, Mercedes-AMG is giving the G 63 and G 65 an impressive sporty look. The exquisite interior specification includes a two-tone instrument panel, two-tone seats in high-quality designo leather with side bolsters in carbon-look leather and contrasting topstitching, seat and door centre panels in a diamond look, carbon-fibre trim and door pulls in nappa leather. 
 
On the outside, a stainless steel underguard, AMG sport stripes along the sides and a protective-strip insert in black aluminium look underscore both the dynamics and exclusivity of the special model. The G 63 is fitted with exclusive 53.3 cm (21-inch) 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels in matt black with high-sheen spokes and 295\/40 R 21 wide-base tyres. The G 65 has an exquisite look with identically sized, ceramically polished 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels. 
 
The Mercedes-Benz G 500 4x4 2 goes into series production 
 
Having proved hugely popular with many customers, the G 500 4x4 2 show car is set to enter series production. In the superlative-studded history of the G-Class, the G 500 4x4 2 is the new highlight in the model range. The technical package consists of the all-wheel-drive powertrain including portal axles and the new 4-litre V8 twin-turbo engine with an output of 310 kW (422 hp). 
 
Also new is the chassis with dual spring\/damper struts and adjustable damping. In the interior of the G 500 4x4 2 , occupants enjoy comfort and an ambience on a par with a luxury saloon. In view of the key data for the chassis and powertrain, it seems more than logical that the off-road world starts for the G 500 4x4 2 where other vehicles give up. The new ""G"" also puts in an absolutely convincing performance on the asphalt. Owing to the considerably wider track of the portal axles compared with the series-production car (+264 mm), the large 22-inch 325\/55 R 22-sized wheels and the adjustable damping with its Sport mode, the enhanced G-Class drives through bends so dynamically that the occupants feel as though they are in a sports car rather than a cross-country vehicle. This also applies to outings on unsurfaced slopes or snow-bound roads, in which case the performance of a high-powered rally car kicks in. 
 
The G 500 4x4 2 will be in Mercedes-Benz dealer showrooms from December 2015, with all other new G-Class models being available from September 2015.

* for Germany, incl. 19% VAT. Daimler AG categorically denies any and all allegations of manipulation. PR Newswire 
 
STUTTGART, Germany, Sept. 25, 2015 
   
STUTTGART, Germany , Sept. 25, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ --  In light of the ongoing assertions from the Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a non-government organisation, and the related speculation, Daimler AG once again clearly states that: 
 We categorically deny the accusation of manipulating emission tests regarding our vehicles. A defeat device, a function which illegitimately reduces emissions during testing, has never been and will never be used at Daimler. This holds true for both diesel and petrol engines. Our engines meet and adhere to every legal requirement.  In light of the written request by the DUH, which was sent to us this morning with a deadline to respond by 3:00 pm (CET) , and the seven questions they posed, we can confirm that none of the allegations apply to our vehicles. The technical programming of our engines adheres to all legal requirements.  We have no knowledge of measurements that indicate our vehicles did not meet legally required standards.  We actively support the work being done within Europe and Germany in order to develop new testing methods which measure emissions based on real driving conditions.  We work closely and constructively with the responsible authorities in Germany , Europe and the United States and will willingly provide any vehicle for testing. 
We'd like to point out that we are evaluating our legal options pertaining to the approach taken and the public assertions made by the DUH.

Stuttgart\/Wien 
 
Sep 29, 2015 
 
* Econic NGT as a catering lifting truck for the Airbus A 380 
 
* Five Unimog trucks in operation as multi-functional implement carriers 
 
The first Euro VI-compliant Mercedes-Benz Econic NGT (Natural Gas Technology) has been delivered to Vienna International Airport. The natural-gas-powered truck will operate as a catering truck equipped with a lifting mechanism manufactured by Doll. Econic's low cab enables a very low delivery height from catering vehicle to plane, which means that all the more widespread types of aircraft, from the Boeing 737 to the Airbus A 380, can be served. This is because a part of the vehicle superstructure is located above the cab, so that the cab's height is decisive when it comes to delivering to smaller aircraft. 
 
With the new Econic NGT, Vienna Airport is also setting new standards of environmental compatibility - the CO[2] emissions of the gas-fuelled engine are around 20 percent lower than those of a diesel engine. When powered by biogas the Econic is actually CO[2] neutral. 
 
Apart from the environmental friendliness of the Mercedes-Benz Econic NGT, its users value the low-entry design which makes for ease of access and exceptional visibility enabled by its low, large-area panoramic windscreen. Visibility is further enhanced by the cameras that provide a 360 degree all-round view. 
 
The Mercedes-Benz Econic is equipped with an Allison automatic transmission as standard. This allows the driver to fully concentrate on driving and traffic, benefiting safety on the airport apron. 
 
Five Unimog U 530 trucks for winter services and airfield cleaning operation 
 
Apart from the Econic NGT, the Vienna airport authorities also opted for five Unimog U 530 trucks whose permissible gross vehicle weight of 16.5 tons and 220 kW (299 hp) engines make them the most powerful variants of the so-called Unimog implement carrier model series. One of the five machines features a road sweeper attachment manufactured by Trilety and also a permanent magnet to remove metal parts from the airfield. The other four Unimog U 530s are intended for winter services and are thus equipped with snow blower-cutters made by Kahlbacher.These implements are used, for instance, to remove the snow walls after the clearing squad has cleaned the runways of snow. Driven by the Unimog's front power take-off, the blower-cutters load the snow onto trucks, which in turn remove it from the airfield. 
 
In 2015 the airport of Vienna already commissioned two Unimog U 427 with salt\/grit spreaders (made by Aebi-Schmidt) and Kahlbacher snow ploughs, in order to secure safe winter operation on the airport apron, taxi- and runways.. DAIMLER : Mercedes-Benz Fashion Engagement - Focus on sustainability: The 2015 Green Carpet Challenge by ERDEM, in partnership with Mercedes Benz. Livia Firth, Founder and Creative Director of the consultancy Eco Age, and Erdem Moralioglucelebrated the launch of The London 2015 Green Carpet Collection by ERDEM with an exclusive, sustainable presentation at The Wallace Collection, in partnership with Mercedes-Benz. The London-based designer has been working alongside Eco-Age to create his first complete collection in accordance with the Green Carpet Challenge® (GCC) Brandmark criteria. Numerous celebrities attended the event for the launch, including Colin Firth, Suki and Immy Waterhouse, Lily Cole, Sophie Hunter, Ellie Goulding, Elizabeth McGovern, Baz Luhrmann and Christopher Bailey. 
 
The collection has been produced using reused, surplus or sustainably certified materials, creating 11 looks that capture Erdem's signature style of versatile yet powerful femininity. In November selected styles from the collection will be available exclusively at the ERDEM flagship store and online as well as on Net-a-porter and Barneys New York. 
 
""We were delighted to have Mercedes-Benz as a partner for The London 2015 Green Carpet Collection launch event this year. In my view, the fashion industry should long have been meeting stringent requirements, similar to those that have become standard in the automotive industry, which would have brought us a great deal further,"" says Livia Firth, Founder and Creative Director, Eco Age. 
 
Sustainability is one of the most important social topics of our time, affecting both, the automotive and fashion industries. Mercedes-Benz, the Stuttgart-based luxury car brand, makes systematic efforts to ensure that its vehicles and their manufacturing processes are as environmentally responsible and as sparing of resources as possible. The partnership with The Green Carpet Challenge, which coincides with the 20th anniversary of Mercedes-Benz's fashion engagement, was a natural fit. 
 
""Commitment to the world of fashion is an established part of our marketing strategy,"" says Wolfgang Schattling, Director of Motorsport Marketing Communications & Branded Entertainment at Mercedes-Benz. ""Through this, we are increasingly able to engage with our female audiences, and to become part of their lifestyle as a brand. Sustainability is an increasingly decisive criterion. With regard to this, it is a logical step for us to support The Green Carpet Challenge. It wonderfully illustrates that design, luxury and responsible actions perfectly fit within a modern lifestyle."" 
 
This particular, current subject is highlighted by Mercedes-Benz's Spring\/Summer 2016 campaign, entitled ""Hybrid by Nature."" This latest campaign features the new GLC Plug-In Hybrid, which can cover up to 34 kilometres utilising electric power alone, with zero emissions. Well-known for her glamorous, funky style, French Editor Carlyne Cerf De Dudzeele set the scene for Dutch supermodel Doutzen Kroes and the new GLC Plug-In Hybrid in the campaign. 
 
20 Years of dedication to fashion by Mercedes-Benz 
 
Over the past 20 years, Mercedes-Benz has established itself globally as a partner at selected fashion events. The brand is currently involved in more than 50 fashion platforms in over 40 countries, including Mercedes-Benz Fashion Weeks in Beijing, Madrid, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Istanbul and Berlin, as well as the acclaimed International Festival of Fashion and Photography in Hyères. The group recognised the parallels between exclusive cars and high-quality fashion collections at an early stage, as in both worlds, passion, style, innovative design, the finest materials and first-class technical implementation are critical factors for success. Mercedes-Benz has therefore consistently supported selected fashion events around the world over the course of two decades, making a name for itself in particular for promoting talented new designers. 
 
Sustainability at Daimler AG 
 
Sustainability is an elementary component of business activities at Daimler AG. The group is committed to environmentally compatible product development and innovative concepts. These range from pioneering vehicle and drive system technologies, intelligent lightweight construction, the use of natural materials and the remanufacturing of components right up to sophisticated assistance systems that can prevent accidents. The group is investing heavily in plug-in hybrids - up to 2017, a new model will be launched in the market every four months, a total of ten new plug-in hybrids. Acting responsibly also means making road traffic even safer. Some 90 percent of traffic accidents are due to human error, which is why the company sees great potential in autonomous driving. Further, the ""responsibility principle"" also guides the premium brand in its dealings with employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, neighbours and NGOs. Daimler follows this guiding principle: only those who act ethically responsibly will also be commercially successful.. Daimler and Renault-Nissan Alliance Break Ground for New Joint-Venture Plant in Mexico. AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico, Sept. 3, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- 
 --  Aguascalientes plant to build next-generation premium compact vehicles
        for the brands Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti
    --  Production of Infiniti vehicles to begin in 2017
    --  Production of Mercedes-Benz vehicles to begin in 2018  
Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance today broke ground for their joint-venture manufacturing complex, COMPAS (Cooperation Manufacturing Plant Aguascalientes), in Aguascalientes in central Mexico, which will build next-generation premium compact vehicles for the brands Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti. 
 
https:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnvar\/20150903\/263484LOGO 
 
""Today marks an important milestone for the partnership between Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance. This new joint plant will help both partners to serve their respective customers faster and with more flexibility. As Mercedes-Benz' first production location for compact cars in the NAFTA region, it will also significantly enlarge our footprint here,"" said Markus Schaefer, Member of the Divisional Board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Production and Supply Chain Management. ""On our end, while sharing high efficiency and flexibility in the joint venture, we will add Mercedes-Benz specific technology as well as further training and assistance by our global lead plant for compact cars in Rastatt, Germany. This proven approach will guarantee that our quality here in Aguascalientes will be the same as at the other locations of our global compact car production network in Europe and China."" 
 
COMPAS is 50:50 owned by Daimler and Nissan. The partners will invest a total of US$1 billion in the joint venture which will oversee the construction and operation of the state-of-the-art manufacturing plant. 
 
""This new plant represents yet another example of the growing collaboration between the Renault-Nissan Alliance and Daimler. Mexico is a global benchmark for quality and efficiency and is a major reason why Daimler and Nissan have decided to produce the next generations of premium compact cars for Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti here in Aguascalientes. What we are celebrating today has also been made possible through our close collaboration and partnership with both the state and Federal governments,"" said Jose Munoz, Executive Vice President, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and Chairman, Management Committee - Nissan North America. 
 
Located near the Nissan Aguascalientes A2 plant, COMPAS will have an initial annual production capacity of more than 230,000 vehicles and will create about 3,600 direct jobs by 2020. Depending on the market development and customer demand, there will be the potential to add additional capacity. Production of Infiniti vehicles will begin in 2017, while the first Mercedes-Benz vehicles will roll off the line in 2018. In addition to the direct employment it provides, COMPAS is also expected to generate some 12,000 indirect jobs - largely due to a high localization rate which will significantly increase the Mexican supply base. 
 
COMPAS is led by an international management team from Daimler and Nissan: Ryoji Kurosawa, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Uwe Jarosch, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Glaucio Leite, Chief Quality Officer (CQO). 
 
Aguascalientes Governor De La Torre said the new plant will be an important source of jobs for the people of Aguascalientes. ""This first stone reaffirms Aguascalientes's position as a major manufacturing base for the global auto industry. We will continue to encourage public and private partnerships to strengthen our position as a base for the world's most important industries."" 
 
More than 400 guests attended the groundbreaking ceremony, including Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexican Minister of Economy; Carlos Lozano de la Torre, Governor of the state of Aguascalientes; Markus Schaefer, Member of the Divisional Board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Production and Supply Chain Management; Joerg Prigl, Head of Product Group Compact Cars, Mercedes-Benz Cars; Jose Munoz, Executive Vice President, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and Chairman, Management Committee - Nissan North America (NNA); Roland Krueger, President of Infiniti Motor Company, Limited; Ryoji Kurosawa, COMPAS CEO; Uwe Jarosch, COMPAS CFO; Glaucio Leite, COMPAS CQO; and Armando Avila, COMPAS Board of Directors Chairman. 
 
As announced in June 2014, Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance will also cooperate in the development of the next-generation premium compact vehicles for the brands Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti. The two partners will closely collaborate at every stage of the product creation process. Brand identity will be safeguarded as the Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti vehicles will clearly differ from each other in terms of product design, driving characteristics, and specifications. 
 
Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance will also produce the next-generation premium compact cars at other production locations around the world, including Europe and China. 
 
Growing together in Mexico 
 
Mexico is already a key location for Daimler with a total of around 8,000 employees. The group has production plants for trucks and buses in Saltillo, Santiago Tianguistenco, and Garcia, a parts distribution center in San Luis Potosi and a remanufacturing plant, a product delivery center, and a training center for passenger cars located in Toluca. 
 
Nissan has been producing vehicles in Aguascalientes since 1992 and is known for its award-winning, highly efficient workforce. In November 2013, Nissan opened a second manufacturing complex in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes A2. Nissan also has a plant in Cuernavaca. Together, the three plants have an annual production capacity of 850,000 vehicles. Nissan is the leading automaker in Mexico, accounting for one in four cars sold. 
 
About the global production network of Mercedes-Benz Cars 
 
26 locations around the world involving more than 70,000 employees form the flexible and efficient global production network of Mercedes-Benz Cars. The network is based on the product architectures of front-wheel drive (compact cars) and rear-wheel drive (for example the S-Class, E-Class, and C-Class) as well as the SUV and sports car architectures. In addition, there is a powertrain production network (engines, transmissions, axles and components). Each of these production networks is grouped around a lead plant that serves as a center of competence for the ramp-up of new products, technology and quality assurance. 
 
About the Renault-Nissan Alliance Manufacturing Network 
 
The Renault-Nissan Alliance operates 81 manufacturing facilities, including 42 vehicle and 39 powertrain plants, in 27 countries. 
 
The Alliance also has production agreements with local industrial partners in 13 countries, including AVTOVAZ in Russia and Dongfeng Motor in China. In total, 106 plants in the world produce cars and engines for the eight Alliance brands. In 2014, the Alliance produced more than 8 million vehicles, an average of one vehicle every four seconds. 
 
Photos from the groundbreaking event in Aguascalientes will be available on the Daimler Media Site by around 08:30 p.m. CEST: www.media.daimler.com

SOURCE  Daimler Corporate Communications. Mercedes-Benz ""Concept IAA"". review photos (27) Videos Specifications:year: 2015make: Mercedes Horsepower @ RPM:274 0-60 time:5.5 sec. Top Speed:155 mph Posted on 09.16.2015 08:00 by Ciprian Florea +   When it comes to concept cars , Mercedes-Benz is arguably one of the most active carmakers in the industry, rolling out stunning show cars on a regular basis. Recent creations include the 2013 Mercedes-Benz Vision Grand Turismo concept and the self-driving 2015 Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury In Motion , but none were as dramatic as the Concept IAA, which made its public debut at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show .
Short for Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile (and not Frankfurt’s official IAA, or Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung, name), the Concept IAA is Mercedes’ latest effort toward perfecting aerodynamics and improving fuel economy by resolving ""the conflicting aims of functionality and aesthetics.""
""The Concept IAA continues our series of visionary concept cars,"" explained Gorden Wagener, Head of Design at Daimler AG. ""The symbiosis of alluring forms showcasing intelligent aerodynamics is an expression of our unique Mercedes-Benz design philosophy.""
And visionary is right, as the IAA is a self-transforming vehicle that literally changes the shape of its body in order to achieve a very low drag coefficient. Keep reading for the full details.

Described as ""a symbiosis of design and aerodynamics,"" the Concept IAA was developed with extreme aerodynamics in mind. Featuring a teardrop-shaped profile, the study not only reminds me of the 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLS and 2014-2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA four-door coupes, but also of the early days of the automobile, when carmakers and inventors were experimenting with aerodynamics by integrating features such as headlamps and fenders into the bodywork.
With the Concept IAA, Mercedes-Benz managed to lower the drag coefficient to a Cd value of only 0.19, making it one of the most aerodynamic cars in history.
Though it’s definitely not a new concept, achieving a low drag coefficient is as challenging as it ever was, even though some production cars feature a Cd figure that’s as low as 0.22. With the Concept IAA, Mercedes-Benz managed to lower the drag coefficient to a Cd value of only 0.19, making it one of the most aerodynamic cars in history.
This fantastic figure was achieved by not by only designing the concept as a teardrop-shaped vehicle, but also due to the car’s ability to transform into an ultra-sleek automobile thanks to an array of body segments that extend at front and the rear, as well as the ""Active Rim"" technology that keeps air away from the wheel arches.
Specifically, when it enters the aerodynamic mode, no fewer than eight segments extend at the back of the car, adding over 15 inches to its length, in what looks like a ridiculously long tail. Meanwhile, flaps located in the front bumper extend out nearly an inch, while the rims ""alter their cupping from 55 mm (2.1 inches) to zero,"" which is the equivalent of getting aerodynamic race wheel covers, but without having to place them on the rims yourself.
The transformation that turns the Concept IAA into a real-life transformer takes place automatically at 50 mph (80 km\/h) or any time the driver wishes to go into aerodynamic mode. Activating it only requires the push of a button. Is that cool or what?
The styling itself goes back to the 1930s, when Mercedes-Benz was busy developing streamlined cars to break speed records and dominate European race tracks. The front end is a massive grille with four horizontal slats that also incorporate LED strips as headlamps, and a featureless engine hood. Around back, the Concept IAA resembles a 1930s streamlined coupe (the 1933-1938 Type 57 Bugatti Atlantic comes to mind), due to its sloping roof and split windscreen, while the fascia is a collection of horizontal bars with taillights incorporated toward each side. A big rear diffuser and a ""Concept IAA"" badge round off the design.Exterior Dimensions
Length5,040 MM (5,430 MM in aerodynamic mode) (198.42 Inches (213.77 Inches))Width1,305 MM (51.37 Inches)Wheelbase2,975 MM (117.12 Inches)Track width front\/rear1710\/1770 MM (67.32\/69.68 Inches)Interior
While the transforming exterior is a never-before-seen feature in the auto industry, the concept’s interior is pretty much a fancied up version of the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class’ . Although the door panels and the seats are different, the dashboard retains the limousine’s configuration, but with new colors and blue ambient lights all over the place. Everything is finished in Anthracite Gray and white for a contrasting appearance, complemented by loads of aluminum inserts.
The steering wheel is also new, although certain cues from the S-Class are visible there as well. The novelty here is that the standard buttons have been replaced by touch-based operating functions, a feature that’s likely to become the norm in high-end Mercedes-Benz vehicles by the end of the decade.Drivetrain
Motivating the Concept IAA is a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that combines a gasoline engine and at least one electric motor. Mercedes didn’t offer any details about the internal combustion unit or the electric motor(s), but it did say the combo delivers 279 horsepower and propels the car to an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph. Judging by the power output, the concept probably borrows the drivetrain from the 2016 Mercedes-Benz C350 Plug-In Hybrid , which consists of a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, an electric motor powered by a 6.2-kWh battery pack, and a 7G-Tronic transmission.
This study manages an all-electric range of 41 miles (66 km) and emits 28 grams of CO2 per km when in aerodynamic mode, and runs for 38.5 miles (62 km) and emits 31 grams of CO2 per km when in design mode. As for fuel economy, the Germans said the advantage of the aerodynamic mode ""is not revealed as clearly in this test as in real-life driving,"" given urban driving is ""accorded a two-thirds weighting in the current New European Driving Cycle (NEDC)."" For reference, the C350 Plug-In Hybrid returns 112 mpg combined.Drivetrain Specifications

Big auto shows are always packed with concept cars, some more spectacular than the others, and the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show was no exception. But even though this year’s even had quite a few studies to drool over, including the Porsche Mission E and the 2016 Bugatti Vision Grand Turismo , the Concept IAA is by far the most impressive of them all, especially when it comes to its transforming exterior. Mercedes had rolled out numerous concepts in the past decade, but none were as wild as the IAA. The fact that we won’t see it in showrooms doesn’t even matter. What matters here is that Mercedes is once again ahead of everyone else and that its approach with the Project IAA goes beyond an efficient drivetrain and a fancy interior.

Press Release
The Mercedes-Benz ""Concept IAA"" (Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile) is two cars in one: an aerodynamics world champion with a Cd value of 0.19 and a four-door coupé embodying irresistible design. The study, which is celebrating its world premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, switches automatically from design mode to aerodynamic mode when the vehicle reaches a speed of 80 km\/h, whereby numerous aerodynamics measures alter the shape of the vehicle. Inside, the ""Concept IAA"" continues the design line of the S-Class and S-Class Coupé, offers new touch-based functions and provides an idea of what the interior of a business saloon might look like in the near future.
At the touch of a button, or automatically on reaching a speed of 80 km\/h, the Mercedes-Benz ""Concept IAA"" (Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile) performs a fascinating transformation in which the captivatingly beautiful four-door coupé turns into an aerodynamics world champion: eight segments extend at the rear, increasing its length by up to 390 millimetres; front flaps in the front bumper extend by 25 mm to the front and 20 mm to the rear, improving the air flow around the front end and the front wheel arches; the Active Rims alter their cupping from 55 mm to zero; and the louvre in the front bumper moves 60 mm to the rear, improving the underbody air flow.
""Fascinating and technically sophisticated cars form the core of Mercedes-Benz. The ’Concept IAA’ applies intelligent innovations to resolve the conflicting aims of functionality and aesthetics and shows that we still have plenty of ideas on how to achieve further improvements in efficiency,"" says Prof. Dr Thomas Weber, Member of the Daimler Board of Management responsible for Group Research and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.
Equally, the ""Concept IAA"" exemplifies the fundamental technological changes which are taking place in the automobile industry. The primary driving force behind this process of change is digitisation – commonly referred to in a business context as ""Industry 4.0"". For Mercedes-Benz, a continuous digital process chain from research and development through production to marketing and sales, logistics and the service area is already becoming reality.
The design and aerodynamic shaping of the ""Concept IAA"" would not have been possible without the systematic digital networking of different specialist departments. The designers have employed the latest algorithmic design methods to handle the complex geometric design. The individually adapted software enables dynamic design in three-dimensional space. This dynamic modelling makes it possible to display and model different states simultaneously. The resultant highly complex geometries were turned into reality with the aid of innovative production technologies (rapid prototyping).
The world-beating aerodynamics were developed in parallel with the aid of numeric flow simulation. In around one million CPU hours, the aerodynamics experts from Mercedes-Benz simulated the flow characteristics, calculating some 300 variants. This roughly corresponds to the scope of work involved in developing a production model.
The ""Concept IAA"" also offers a look into the future in areas which are not apparent at first glance. The study features Car-to-X technology, for example, which enables the study to communicate with other vehicles or other sources of information. This represents a major advance in helping to avoid accidents, as obstacles or events which are not visible to the vehicle itself can be detected - the ""Concept IAA"" is able to look around the corner, as it were. With this and its interior and operating concept, the ""Concept IAA"" also offers a foretaste of the business saloon of the near future.
Exterior design: sensual purity and innovative aerodynamics
With its dynamic basic shape (""drop shape""), elegantly purist overall design and aerodynamic innovations, the four-door ""Concept IAA"" Coupé Saloon is a symbiosis of design and aerodynamics. The vehicle interprets classic sports car proportions in a modern vein: the long bonnet flows aerodynamically into the compact, set-back greenhouse, whose roof slopes down elegantly towards the rear, ending in an airflow break-away edge.
The vehicle’s elegant side view combines a purist, long basic volume with highly pronounced wheel arches. The sporty, minimalist front of the show car boasts a striking ""shark nose"" profile. Like the front, the show car’s rear end also presents a clear-cut and purist appearance. As on the front grille, horizontal louvres lend structure to the shape of the rear end. An illuminated ring running around the rear end adds the finishing touch to the high-tech appearance.
""The ’Concept IAA’ continues our series of visionary concept cars,"" explains Gorden Wagener, Head of Design at Daimler AG. ""The symbiosis of alluring forms showcasing intelligent aerodynamics is an expression of our unique Mercedes-Benz design philosophy.""
The interior: touch-based operating philosophy
The interior of the ""Concept IAA"" combines stylish sportiness with modern luxury. The interior continues the design line of the S-Class and S-Class Coupé while providing an idea of what the interior of a business saloon might look like in the near future. The choice of colours and materials conjures up extrovert contrasts between anthracite and white as well as between aluminium and cut glass. Elegantly curved forms, flowing lines, carefully chosen high-quality materials and the touch-based operating philosophy provide for a high level of functionality.
The two-spoke steering wheel is a progressive further development of the Mercedes-Benz steering wheel philosophy. The open structure of its horizontal spokes is highly intricate in design, as a manifestation of intelligent and elegant lightweight construction. The steering wheel also incorporates touch-based operating functions, offering great functionality in the most compact dimensions as a study in perfect ergonomics: OFN (Optical Finger Navigation) buttons, embedded in the clusters in a similar hovering manner as the touchpad in the centre console, enable the driver to scroll through the instrument cluster menus. The OFN button on the left controls the left-hand display, while the button on the right controls the right-hand display. In this way, the ""hands on the wheel, eyes on the road"" operating philosophy which has been applied by Mercedes-Benz for many years now is implemented in a manner which is at once brilliantly simple and uncompromising.
""Captivatingly sporty lines, fascinating technical solutions: the ’Concept IAA’ symbolises the emotional core of Mercedes-Benz: The best or nothing. And it shows in a host of details what our customers can look forward to in future production models,"" says Ola Källenius, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing & Sales, summing up the visionary concept.
The ""Concept IAA"" is 5040 millimetres long (5430 mm in aerodynamic mode), 1995 mm wide and 1305 mm high. Its wheelbase measures 2975 mm, and the front\/rear track widths are 1710 and 1770 mm respectively. The concept car is powered by a petrol\/electric plug-in hybrid drive with a total output of 205 kW (279 hp). This provides it with a top speed of 250 km\/h (electronically limited). CO2 emissions and electric range depend on the mode in which the vehicle is tested: in aerodynamic mode the ""Concept IAA"" manages an all-electric range of 66 kilometres and emits 28 g CO2 per km. In design mode the range stands at 62 km and CO2 emissions at 31 g per km. As urban driving is accorded a two-thirds weighting in the current New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the advantage of aerodynamic mode is not revealed as clearly in this test as in real-life driving. Real-life fuel savings are all the greater, however – in keeping with Mercedes-Benz’s customer-oriented ""Real Life Efficiency"" philosophy.
The ""Concept IAA"" show car forms part of a long line of aerodynamically perfected vehicles from Mercedes-Benz. With a dimensional concept that makes it suitable for everyday use, this four-seater attains a Cd value of 0.19, assuring it of a place in the gallery of record-breaking and racing vehicles such as the Mercedes-Benz W 25 record-breaker of the 1936 season.
At present the models from Mercedes-Benz occupy the top position for aerodynamics in practically every vehicle segment. In 2013 the Mercedes-Benz CLA attained a Cd figure of 0.22 – marking a new all-time low both within the Mercedes-Benz model portfolio and amongst all series production cars.

What do buyers of electric cars want? More range! So that's what Nissan is giving them in the 2016 Leaf. Unfortunately, the stronger battery increases the price of the EV, which has seen demand fade with falling gas prices—sales are off 35 percent through August.-
SV and SL versions of the 2016 Leaf receive the battery upgrade, going from a 24-kWh unit to one with 30 kWh of capacity. The more robust battery increases the EPA-rated driving range from 84 to 107 miles, which is tops among compact EVs.-
-
The extra miles don't come free, however. The Leaf SV sees its MSRP increase by $2100 to $35,050 (before $7500 federal tax credit), while the SL climbs by $1670 to $37,640 (again, without the $7500 rebate from Uncle Sam).-
The base model, the Leaf S, has no price increase for 2016—staying at $29,860 before credits—but it doesn't get the new battery either. It keeps the existing 24-kWh unit and continues to be rated at 84 miles of emissions-free driving.-

In non-battery news, the Leaf is also treated to connectivity upgrades. The base S gets NissanConnect with Mobile Apps (Bluetooth phone and audio and text messaging) for its five-inch screen. The SV and SL add navigation, XM Travel Link (weather, sports, stocks, movie listings, and—useful for taking delight in the suffering of others—fuel prices), and remote monitoring of vehicle charging and climate control, all on a larger, seven-inch screen. Finally, there are three new colors: Deep Blue Pearl, Coulis Red, and Forged Bronze, but all Leafs really are green, of course.-

from Car and Driver Blog http:\/\/ift.tt\/nSHy27 Put the internet to work for you. Turn off or edit this Recipe. Can state really cut gasoline use by 50 percent?. For 50 years, California has led the nation in passing environmental standards to protect its beaches, restore wildlife and reduce smog. 

But as the final days of this year's legislative session in Sacramento loom, a controversial bill that would require the state to reduce petroleum use by motor vehicles at least 50 percent by 2030 is causing people in the Capitol and around the state to ask: ""Is that even possible?"" 

Yet lost in the debate are two key facts: 

The state will get halfway to that goal even if it does nothing. That's because of federal rules put into place in 2009 by President Barack Obama to double the gas mileage standards for new U.S. vehicles to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. 

Second, the rest of the difference can be made up simply by enforcing -- and in some cases strengthening -- existing laws passed over the last 15 years to boost electric cars, promote mass transit and reduce the amount of carbon in fuels, according to experts who have done the math. 

""It is a huge target. It's a significant milestone. We need to continue to innovate, but Californians are already on a path to get there,"" said Dan Kammen, a UC Berkeley professor of energy. 

Oil companies have spent millions on radio and TV ads in recent weeks warning that the measure, SB350, could lead to gas rationing, a ban on minivans and other radical changes. 


""This law will limit how much we can drive our own cars,"" a man says in one TV ad sponsored by the Western States Petroleum Association, whose members include Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Occidental Petroleum. ""The state will also be collecting and monitoring our personal driving habits and tracking how much gas we use."" 

Environmentalists, Gov. Jerry Brown and the bill's author, state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, D-Los Angeles, call the ads cynical scare tactics. They say the law is critical in continuing California's progress to reduce smog, wean the state from oil and curb greenhouse gas emissions as the planet continues to steadily warm. The bill does not require gas rationing, a ban on certain vehicles or government monitoring of how much people drive. 

""There's a lot of fear-mongering and paranoia going on right now,"" said Simon Mui, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group in San Francisco. ""The oil industry doesn't like the demand for their product being reduced. Some of the claims are really ludicrous."" 

But industry officials and other critics, who include the California Chamber of Commerce and Republican leaders, say the bill is too vague. They note that it hands the California Air Resources Board, a powerful state agency established in 1967 by Gov. Ronald Reagan, the responsibility of figuring out how to halve gasoline and diesel use statewide -- which critics say gives the agency too much leeway. 

""We've been asking: How do you get a 50 percent reduction without some drastic measures being taken that would impact everyday Californians?"" said Beth Miller, a spokeswoman for the California Driver's Alliance, a group funded by the oil industry. 

The bill's lack of specifics has put its chances in doubt, as moderate Democrats, many from the Central Valley, have raised concerns about gas prices and other hardships. 

""We need to do a better job explaining how we are going to get there, and we are working on that,"" said Anthony Reyes, a spokesman for de León. 

He said that de León will offer amendments to clarify the bill early this week, with a final vote possible in the Assembly by Wednesday or Thursday. 

Air Resources Board officials say that California could cut gasoline and diesel use in half -- from the current 17.4 billion gallons to about 8.7 billion gallons in the next 15 years -- almost entirely by relying on existing rules. 

""This is not a cosmic shift. It is basically us continuing to do what we are already doing today,"" said Ryan McCarthy, a senior scientist at the board. 

There are five key ways to hit the goal, according to the agency's calculations: 
Rely on Obama's federal gas mileage rules doubling mileage standards 10 years down the road. If California takes no action, the state still will see a 24 percent reduction in petroleum use by 2030 because of that federal law, which is endorsed by the auto industry and on track to meet its target. Tighten greenhouse gas emission standards for new cars. In 2002, Gov. Gray Davis signed a measure, authored by then-Assemblywoman Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, requiring the air board to force automakers to reduce those emissions in new vehicles. The law, which survived legal challenges, could be ratcheted down, requiring even more cleaner-burning, fuel efficient engines. Other car standards, such as requiring automakers to sell tires with less rolling resistance to boost gas mileage, could be required under AB32, the state's landmark 2006 law that required overall California greenhouse emissions to be cut to 1990 levels by 2020, a goal that is so far on target. Increase in-fill development and mass transit. In 2008, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a law, SB375, to provide more transportation funding to areas that build housing near light rail, BART and other transit as a way to reduce highway congestion. More incentives for buses, bikes, development in urban areas and construction of high-speed rail would reduce the amount of vehicle miles traveled and cut gasoline use, in future years, the air board says. Expand electric and hybrid cars. In 2012, the air board passed a landmark rule requiring that 15 percent of new cars sold in California in 2025 be either a plug-in hybrid, electric or fuel cell vehicle. It also requires a 75 percent reduction in smog-forming emissions from new vehicles. The air board estimates that those regulations will add $1,900 to the price of a new car by 2025 -- but will save owners $5,900 in gasoline over the life of the average vehicle. The state could further boost hybrid, electric and plug-in electric cars -- like the Nissan Leaf or plug-in Prius -- through more tax credits, free parking in public garages and carpool lane privileges, air board studies have found. Reduce the carbon in fuels. In 2007, Schwarzenegger approved a ""low carbon fuel standard"" that requires oil companies to reduce the amount of carbon in gasoline and diesel by 10 percent by 2020, largely through blending more biofuels. That standard could be increased to 15 or 20 percent by 2030, air board scientists say. 
""If you take our current policies and assuming some reasonable ratcheting down by 2030, you either get to the goal or get very close,"" McCarthy said. 

Environmentalists note that the last 15 years of California laws have led to more efficient cars on the roads. Statewide gasoline use peaked 10 years ago and has fallen 10.5 percent since 2006. Automakers offered only 12 car models that could achieve 30 miles per gallon or more in 2008. But by 2013, there were 70. 

Meanwhile, California's greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 5 percent since 2006 while its GDP has gone up 30 percent, from $1.6 trillion to $2.2 trillion. 

""These are changes that have already been happening incrementally,"" Mui said. ""And other than seeing more hybrid cars and fuel-efficient cars on the road, most people haven't even noticed."" 

Still, opponents don't trust the air board. 

""There has not been a robust debate on where the rubber meets the road,"" Miller said. ""Details matter. We need to have the details in an open discussion. Right now this bill is down to the wire.""

Electric Vehicles – Part of the Solution, but No Magic Bullet. Electric vehicles – Choose your weapon.
If the werewolf is climate change, then we’ve been feeding the wolf too much, when what we really need is a silver bullet. The question is, who’s loading the gun and with what? Given that transportation covers about a third of emissions, at least in the US, or about a sixth of global emissions, one might think of electric vehicles as one of those bullets.
Now, it’s not like Tesla Motors is the only player in the game, as just about every automaker has at least a hybrid vehicle, if not a plug-in hybrid or pure electric vehicle, in their lineups. We’re really looking forward to seeing how far vehicles such as the Tesla Model 3, Chevy Bolt, and Nissan Leaf, can really go, but Tesla did something that could put electric vehicles on the fast-track, opening up the patent wall to anyone wanting to develop their own electric vehicles and fast-charging systems.
Tesla wants to see 500,000 Tesla Model 3 per year after it starts production. On the other hand, other manufacturers aren’t so, let’s say, “confidence-inspiring.” Where Tesla has been aggressively pushing its right to sell, other cars, such as the Fiat 500e, are nearly impossible to find outside of California. Still, come calculations suggest that electric vehicles could see enough penetration into global markets to stagnate fuel consumption, returning them to 2014 levels, but not for another 25 to 35 years. Is it enough to get back to last year’s levels, though?
So, no, electric vehicles aren’t the magic bullet, but just one of them. Get your six-shooter ready, because it needs loading.. Titans Kick Off Season at Home with Pep Rally for Nissan. NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans kicked off the start of football season at home by throwing a pep rally for Nissan executives and more than 1,000 of its employees Friday afternoon. 
 
‘Voice of the Titans’ Mike Keith welcomed the crowd and spoke about the Titans season, the team’s new synergy on-field, the new partnership with the Titans and the background of the Nissan Stadium program. 
 
“It’s a great partnership!” said Fred Diaz, senior vice president, sales & marketing and operations U.S.A., at Nissan. “The spirit of a great partnership is when both partners go above and beyond what they are supposed to do.  This is creating a great presence for our brand in Nashville but also on a national level.  It’s just the start!”  
 
“This is a great event and just one example of how our partnership with Nissan is off to a fantastic start!” said Titans Owner, Board of Director, Kenneth S. Adams, IV.  ”They have so many employees in Middle Tennessee and it’s really exciting for us to come to their headquarters and share our enthusiasm about this season with the first regular season game at Nissan Stadium this Sunday.” 
 
The pep rally took place at the Nissan North America office in Franklin.  Nissan first came to the United States to sell vehicles in 1958 and began importing and making Datsun vehicles in the United States under the Nissan Motor Corporation, U.S.A. (NMC), name in 1960. In 1990, Nissan North America Inc. (NNA), was created to coordinate all of Nissan's various activities in North America to enhance the design, development, manufacturing, and marketing of Nissan vehicles. In 1998, the two organizations merged operations under the Nissan North America, Inc., name. Headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee, Nissan's North American operations include automotive styling, engineering, consumer and corporate financing, sales and marketing, distribution and manufacturing for the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
 
The pep rally treated everyone to an afternoon of fun activities including music, food, inflatable games, corn hole toss, tire throw, caricatures and prize giveaways.  Titans’ mascot, T-Rac entertained everyone with his usual antics, Titans cheerleaders signed autographs and posed for pictures. 
 
Former Titans players, Chris Hope, Neil O’Donnell and Chris Sanders were also on hand to sign autographs and pose for pictures. 
 
""Enriching people's lives"" – this is the global vision of Nissan and all of its operating companies across the world. Nissan supports its vision by offering customers unparalleled products and services and by improving the quality of life in the communities where it operates. 
 
Annual events like this one help to bring partners together with the greater Nashville area.  The Titans will host their first regular season home game at Nissan Stadium against the Indianapolis Colts this Sunday afternoon, kickoff at noon.

  RECOMMENDED. Shock Therapy. Plug it in, plug it in: A BMW i3 is tested at the IAA international motor show in Frankfurt, Germany, on Sept. 11, 2013. Photo by Johannes Eisele\/AFP\/Getty Images As I steered a BMW i3 loaner into a Northwest Washington, D.C., parking garage, I glanced at the time: 30 minutes before drinks. The electric car’s battery was almost dead, but I could fix that—this garage had a high-power charging station. It could add about 60 miles of juice in that half-hour. I pushed a button to unlatch the car’s charging port, jumped out, and gathered the hefty electrical cable. Then I reached for my credit card and looked for a swiper affixed to the charging box. Instead, I found a small decal explaining that I needed a membership to charge at an eVgo station. Translation: No matter how much I was willing to pay to charge at that moment—and I was willing to pay quite a bit—I couldn’t. And I found myself thinking that this eVgo charger was an apt metaphor for the Obama administration’s policy on electric vehicles. During the economic crisis, the Obama administration invested prodigiously in electric cars—but afterward it curtailed any support for public charging infrastructure. And that’s holding EVs back. So while California started the electric revolution, Washington is on the brink of ending it. Today American companies manufacture fewer EVs than automakers from Europe, China, or Japan, and U.S. EV sales have slipped from first to third inthe world—behind Europe and China. Meanwhile, last month Russia’s prime minister decreed that every gas station in the country must install EV charging by November 2016. Advertisement America’s policy was not the result of thoughtful cost-cutting—we still spend abundantly on EVs. We just spend that money in the wrong places. Starting in 2007, after California had already spent more than a decade promoting electric vehicles, Washington embraced EVs as the solution to skyrocketing oil prices, moribund American manufacturing, climate change, and dependence on foreign oil. It didn’t matter if you were a tree hugger, union leader, or national security buff: There was something to love about EVs. The following year, John McCain toured the Chevy Volt design center and candidate Barack Obama called for 1 million plug-in electric vehicles on U.S. roads by 2015. As GM’s management stared into the abyss of bankruptcy, Congress and the Obama administration made the safe delivery of the Volt a virtual precondition for the company’s $50 billion bailout. In 2009, during the stimulus, the administration went a bit crazy funding big, expensive EV startups and battery plants. Washington spent $2.5 billion on loans to Nissan, Fisker, and Tesla. It also sank almost $600 million funding battery-manufacturing plants for A123 (which has since gone bankrupt), Dow-Kokam (sold off by Dow in 2013), and LG Chem. Then there was the up-to-$7,500 consumer tax break for buying an electric car. Good for up to 200,000 units per manufacturer, that generous rebate will end up costing the U.S. government roughly $2 billion per automaker. Considering there are about 30 auto manufacturers doing business in the United States, that could get expensive. All this was supposed to lay the foundation for a new generation of clean, quiet electric vehicles on American roads. After more than 100 years of investing in internal combustion engines—and trillions of dollars invested in the infrastructure for oil and gasoline—it made sense for government to invest in this transition to EVs. But when I went to work as an adviser to the undersecretary of energy in 2012, it was immediately evident that a program to promote essential charging infrastructure was missing. There was a public-private partnership called the EV Project. But personally, I was mystified by its approach. EV plugs come at three power levels. Level 1 is just a standard 120-volt electrical outlet. It’s dirt-cheap, and can give you 4 or 5 miles of range in an hour. Level 2 charging requires electrical equipment that is much more expensive and runs off the same outlet as a clothes dryer at 240 volts. It provides 10 or 20 miles of range an hour, depending on the car. Then there’s DC fast charging at 480 volts. It’s expensive but can fill an EV battery to 80 percent in 20 to 30 minutes—a huge advantage. The EV Project spent $230 million giving away chargers—mostly to Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt owners, not public spaces. The vast majority of these were Level 2 chargers. For that amount of money, you could carpet major U.S. cities with Level 1 charging and still have money left over for fast chargers.  But the entire EV Project included only 107 fast chargers. Averaged out, the cost per charging unit installed was about $19,000—much, much higher than it should have been. Not all of that $230 million went to chargers—it was also spent on extensive analysis of the data—but the costs still seemed stratospheric. Other than the EV Project, there was nothing going on. Republicans had decided they didn’t like EVs anymore, and the administration inexplicably determined that, henceforth, the private sector should take care of installing and running public EV charging stations. Unfortunately, that idea demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the business model necessary to make public charging work. (Continued from Page 1) Public charging was not going to be profitable as a stand-alone product. Electricity as a fuel is cheap—much cheaper than gasoline. But charging stations are relatively expensive, and most EV charging is done at home. My younger brother drives his Ford C-Max Energi 100 electric miles a week. Every night he charges at home from a standard wall socket. The electricity is so cheap, he “cannot tell the difference” in his utility bill. But installing a Level 2 EV charger would cost about $1,500—and more for a commercial user. That said, public charging stations are incredibly important. They give people the peace of mind that they won’t find themselves stranded without fuel. DC fast chargers are especially critical—because they can fill your battery with a meaningful amount of juice within 15 or 20 minutes. Later this fall the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions will be releasing a study on business models for public charging infrastructure. Dan Welch, an EV analyst at the center, says, “The math is difficult for privately funded charging station operators.” That’s been clear for some time. But for some reason, the Obama administration took a remarkably hands-off approach to charging infrastructure. As a result America has three incompatible fast-charger standards (Tesla, CHAdeMO, and SAE) and a dozen subscription-based services that generally let you charge only if you are a member. If these subscription-based chargers were all over the place, this would be less of a problem. Unfortunately, they’re not. According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, there are only about 2,565 fast chargers in the entire United States. Japan has more than twice that number packed into a landmass roughly the size of California—with one dominant standard. The situation has gotten so bad that frustrated automakers like Nissan, BMW, and Tesla are installing their own charging stations. The good news is that the Obama administration could get America back on track with just a small reallocation of federal budgets toward EV charging infrastructure—and fast chargers in particular. Paltry investments in EV charging could be transformative. BMW sells a DC fast charger that costs only $6,458—less than the tax break for a single EV. The unit still needs to be installed and maintained (which isn’t cheap), but it provides a public refueling option for hundreds or thousands of EV drivers. For about $30 million, America could literally give 5,000 of these chargers to businesses, malls, convenience stores, and municipalities every single year. That would increase America’s number of fast chargers by 200 percent in the first year. This isn’t a lot of money. The DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has a 2016 budget request of $2.7 billion—with $444 million dedicated to vehicle technologies. So why not carve out a slice for fast chargers? Another option would be to eliminate the tax credit for EVs over $50,000 and redirect those funds toward charging infrastructure. That would require help from Congress but would certainly pay dividends. In 2014 the tax cuts for Teslas alone were worth over $125 million—that’s a lot of fast chargers. And no one buying a $119,000 Tesla P90D needs a $7,500 tax break. Working with cities to update building codes could make it simple and cheap to install these chargers. And a few strategic modifications to utility rate structures would complete the equation. What makes this failure more frustrating is that all the other pieces are there: Automakers have built some really great electric cars. For instance, the Tesla P85D was so good, it “broke” the Consumer Reports’ ratings system. The BMW i3, which I was driving, is the perfect urban vehicle. Because of its unique carbon fiber architecture, it’s as small as a compact car, with the spacious feel of a full-size sedan or crossover—and the zip of a BMW. This year Nissan is rolling out a new Leaf with longer range, and there’s huge buzz surrounding the 2016 Chevy Volt. But it’s still shockingly hard to charge in America. The day before my eVgo incident, I drove to a party in Maryland and tried to find a charger on the way back. After much searching, I finally found one in a Mercedes dealership, hidden next to a small tree. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a fast charger. Still, I plugged in and sat—hoping to gain a few electric miles. After 15 minutes the security guard rapped on my window and asked me to leave. I had gained approximately 1 mile. Later I hunted for a charger a few blocks from the White House. Finding one was virtually impossible. In Virginia the closest fast charger was so far that getting there and back would have drained my entire battery. Instead, I spent the weekend limping along on the i3’s range extender—a small internal combustion engine meant for just such circumstances. With only 50 miles of nonelectric range, I was constantly on the lookout for my next hit of oil. But that’s pretty much the state of EVs in America today. Most neighborhoods are a few wall sockets and fast chargers away from a convenient, reliable, environmentally friendly transportation alternative to oil. But we're not there yet. The Obama administration already saved GM, it raised fuel economy standards and implemented the first greenhouse gas emission standards for automobiles. Charging—especially fast charging—is the missing link. With a tiny bit of effort, and funding that amounts to a rounding error in the overall scheme of EV subsidies, Obama could supercharge the next generation of American automobiles. He should do it.

Nissan’s Qashqai crossover has become the fastest-selling UK-built car in history - with one rolling off the production line every 62 seconds. 

The news comes as Britain’s top car makers today announced a £2billion investment and jobs boom as they launched a pre-emptive export strike against their European rivals ahead of next week’s Frankfurt Motor Show. More than eight out of ten cars built in the UK are exported. 

The new second-generation Qashqai was announced as the fastest UK-manufactured car ever to reach the half million milestone – achieving it in just 21 months.  
   
Car making record: Nissan's factory in Sunderland produced 500,000 Qashqai in just 21 months 

Since the start of production in January 2014 a new Qashqai has been finished every 62 seconds on the Sunderland factory’s line. 

It beat previous records set in the 1960s by the MK1 Ford Cortina, which took 34 months to hit the half million landmark, and the Austin\/Morris 1100\/1300 which reached the same total in 29 months. Nissan described the achievement of its family-friendly and flexible cross-over as a ‘record breaking milestone’. 
 
A spokesman said: ’Nissan’s pioneering flagship crossover has become the fastest ever UK-built vehicle to smash the half million production mark.’ 

It also follows Nissan’s £100million investment into the new Juke, which will secure thousands of jobs beyond 2020. 

Nissan Europe chairman Paul Willcox said: ‘The Nissan Qashqai is going from strength to strength. Half a million Qashqais in just 21 months is an astonishing achievement and proof that the Qashqai is hitting the spot with buyers. 

‘Together with the pioneering first generation version, there are now more than 2.5million Qashqais on the road in Europe, making Nissan the undisputed leader in the crossover sector.’ 
   
Britsh success stories: The ten car brands represented at the SSMT Greenwich event include Aston Martin, Bentley, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, MINI, Nissan, Rolls-Royce, Toyota and Vauxhall 

Nissan’s Sunderland plant employs more than 6,700 people and currently produces the Nissan Qashqai, Note, Juke and the electric LEAF. Production of the upmarket Infiniti Q30 begins in 2016. 

More than 8million vehicles have been built at Sunderland since 1986 with 80 per cent of production exported to 100 markets worldwide. Some 500,238 vehicles were produced at Sunderland last year alone – with one in three cars built in the UK wearing a Nissan badge. It follows investment of more than £3.5billion. 

Professor Garel Rhys CBE, president of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University said: ‘The new Qashqai’s total output of 500,000 in the remarkably short time of 21 months is but another example of the flow of superlatives being reached by Nissan Manufacturing UK in Sunderland. 

‘This is put into proper context by the supremely successful Morris-Austin 1100\/1300 and the Mark One Ford Cortina which took 29 months and 34 months respectively to reach this landmark.’ 
   
Nissan said since the start of production in January 2014 a new Qashqai has been finished every 62 seconds 

The announcement comes as Nissan was one of ten car manufacturers with factories in Britain to join Business Secretary Sajid Javid to fly the flag at an official ‘send-off’ of cars ahead of the prestigious show in Germany which is the biggest and most influential in Europe.  

Car bosses said investment in the UK automotive sector had already broken the £2billion barrier for the first 8 months of 2015 – with 4,500 new jobs announced in the same period. 

Top executives said the event at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich was a ‘unique send-off’ to Frankfurt for the ten car brands represented which include Aston Martin, Bentley, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, MINI, Nissan, Rolls-Royce, Toyota and Vauxhall. 

Rolls-Royce and Bentley have just unveiled new super-luxury models – the Dawn soft-top and Bentaygo 4X4 respectively. 

Vauxhall bosses spelled out how the launch of the new British-built Astra hatchback and estate will secure the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire for the next 10 years. 

This year alone Honda has invested £200million in production of the next-generation Civic at Swindon. Jaguar Land Rover invested £600milllion expanding production, research and facilities in the West Midlands, while the London Taxi Company invested £250million on production of next-generation of ultra-low emission taxis. 
   
British-built: The new Astra Sports Tourer is built at Ellesmere Port 

Cars appearing at the event were the Aston Martin Rapide built at Gaydon in Warwickshire, the Crewe-built Bentley Flying Spur, the Honda Civic Type-R from Swindon, the Jaguar XF from Castle Bromwich in Birmingham, the Range Rover from Solihull near Birmingham, the MINI Clubman built at Oxford, the Sunderland built Nissan Qashqai, the Rolls-Royce Dawn built at Goodwood in Sussex, the Toyota Auris Hybrid Touring Sports from Burnaston in Warwickshire, and the Vauxhall Astra from Ellesmere Port.  

A spokesman for the UK’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: ’Global appetite for high-quality British-built cars has never been stronger with exports to more than 100 countries worldwide. 

‘Demand across Europe – our biggest export market – grew more than 10 per cent last year, and overall car exports were worth £24.6billion in 2014 – the most ever.‘  

He added: ’The first six months of this year saw more cars produced here than in any half-year since 2008, with a vehicle rolling off an assembly line every 20 seconds’. 

The UK car industry supports almost 800,000 jobs across the country – around 160,000 of which are in manufacturing – and accounts for 11.8 per cent of all exports. 

Some eight out of ten cars built in Britain are exported, giving a big boost to the UK’s balance of payments. 

In the home UK market, the first six months of 2015 have delivered the best half year since recession. 
   
British-built Astra hatchback and estate will secure the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire for the next 10 years 

August was the 42nd month of growth with 79,060 new cars registered, up 9.6 per cent on last August. 

In the year to date, new car registrations to date are up 6.7 per cent to 1,634,369 vehicles. And UK car production in the year to date to July stands at 911,307 vehicle. 

SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ‘The UK automotive industry’s resurgence continues and this diverse range of British-built cars which will premiere in Frankfurt clearly demonstrates the strength of UK automotive. 

‘From Goodwood to Sunderland, Llanelli to Falkirk, the automotive industry supports some 800,000 highly skilled jobs making world class products of which Britain can be justifiably proud.’ 

Business Secretary Sajid Javid said: ‘The automotive industry is a UK success story with government and industry working closely to boost productivity and growth.’ 

Joe Greenwell, chief executive of the Automotive Investment Organisation said: ‘The stars are uniquely aligned for the UK automotive industry, and we should be proud that the sector is leading a resurgence in UK manufacturing.’

SOURCE  Wounded Warrior Project. Community Group Acquire First Electric WAV. A community transport group in Yorkshire has become the first organisation in the country to acquire a ground breaking new fully electric, wheelchair accessible vehicle. 
 
Community Transport Calderdale (CTC) is a charitable organisation based at Luddendenfoot, near Halifax, West Yorkshire.  Their aim is to provide transport for those in the area who cannot access existing forms of transport for reasons of ill health, isolation, disability, poverty or social exclusion. 
 
Established in 2002, the organisation offers a Community Car and Accessible Minibus Service to individuals and groups within the Calderdale area. 
 
As an extension to their existing car service CTC successfully secured funding from the Elland Staying Well Project to assist with the running of a new, fully electric Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV) to help those in need to access local community events. 
 
The vehicle CTC have acquired, supplied by wheelchair accessible vehicle manufacturer Brotherwood, is the first wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) to be driven solely by electric power. Known as the ‘Envy’, the vehicle is based upon the Nissan eNV-200 Combi, a battery powered vehicle that shares technology with the UK’s best-selling electric vehicle the Nissan Leaf. With no noise and zero-emissions, electric vehicles such as the Envy offer the eco-friendly transport options that many fleets and authorities are expected to provide. 
 
With a range of up to 106 miles on a single charge, the Envy is ideal for the shorter journeys in and around town that are typical of a community transport organization such as CTC, and can be fully recharged in as little as half an hour from one of the many electric vehicle charging points in and around the Calderdale area. This offers an economical and convenient solution for CTC, who can now benefit from low cost top-ups at many of their regular destinations including Morrisons supermarket and local dealer Lightcliffe Nissan. 
 
The Envy enables CTC to provide a flexible and multi-purpose transport – with 4 passenger seats in addition to the driver, plus space for one wheelchair user to travel seated in their wheelchair. Wheelchair access is provided by a folding ramp at the rear of the vehicle, with a powered restraint system making it quick and easy to load and secure the wheelchair passenger. However the Envy can be driven on a standard car driver’s license – eliminating the need for CTC staff to undergo any further expensive and time-consuming driver training. 
 
The Envy also benefits from a compact footprint, enabling CTC to offer wheelchair-accessible transport to smaller groups where previously a larger minibus or people carrier from their fleet might have been used. The tight turning circle and small dimensions make it ideal for use not only in town but also along the tight rural lanes that connect many of CTC’s destinations. 
 
“ Adding the electric WAV to our fleet has not only helped a number of people in the area with transport problems but has done so in a great eco-friendly and economical way.  The running costs of this vehicle are minimal, and is a pilot project for the way forward in our future fleet .” commented Steve Welsh, CEO of Community Transport Calderdale. 
 
The Brotherwood Envy is available now to lease or buy from Brotherwood, and carries full European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval. For more information call Brotherwood on 01935 872603 or visit www.gogreenwithenvy.co.uk.

The 2016 version of the Nissan Leaf will now be able to travel an estimated 107 miles between charges, a 27% increase over the original version of the battery-electric vehicle. 
 
The Japanese maker is taking advantage of improvements in lithium-ion technology to squeeze a 30 kilowatt-hour battery into the 2016 model. Until now, the Nissan Leaf had used a 24 kWh pack. Nissan now claims to offer “best-in-class” range, and the numbers are better than such competitors as the Ford Focus EV that get less than 100 miles per charge. But it still lags well behind the much costlier Tesla Model S, as well as the 200-mile Bolt model Chevrolet is currently developing. 
 
Charge Up! 
 
“We know that to maintain that leadership, we must continue developing battery technology that strikes that ideal balance between capacity, packaging, durability and affordability,” said Andrew Speaker, director, Nissan Electric Vehicle Sales & Marketing. 
 
While critics say the technology isn’t evolving fast enough, proponents note that lithium batteries are becoming more powerful, smaller and less expensive. Where lithium-ion batteries were running as much as $1,000 a kWh when the Leaf came to market in late 2009, industry insiders say that has dropped to as little as $400 today. The goal is to reach $200 or less before decade’s end. 
 
(Luxury makers take aim at Tesla with new extended-range battery-cars. Click Here for the story.) 
 
The original, 24 kWh battery will still be offered in the base Nissan Leaf S model. 
 
For 2016, a Leaf S with the current, 24 kWh battery will hold its base price – before federal and state tax incentives – to $29,860. That includes $850 in delivery charges. Range remains 84 miles. 
 
The new, 30 kWh pack will be standard equipment in more SV and SL premium versions. The 2016 Nissan Leaf SL will start at $35,250, including delivery, while the SV base price will be $37,640. All models are eligible for a $7,500 U.S. tax credit and other local and state incentives. 
 
The 2016 model will retain the same powertrains as in the 2015 Nissan Leaf, an 80 kilowatt AC synchronous motor making 107 horsepower and 187 pound-feet of torque. 
 
While Nissan notes it has so far sold 185,000 Leafs worldwide, proponents acknowledge demand for the little battery car – and virtually all of its competitors – has fallen short of expectations. And with gas prices sliding, demand for hybrids, plug-ins and pure battery-electric vehicles has slipped in the U.S. by double digits since the beginning of the year. 
 
Cost is a factor limiting consumer demand, as is performance. But range has become the big bogey for an auto industry investing billions of dollars to electrify its fleet to meet upcoming emissions and fuel economy standards in the U.S. and abroad.

Tesla has continued growing volume, despite cheap fuel, by delivering a mix of performance, luxury features and range that is expected to approach 300 miles per charge with the addition of a new P90d version of the Model S battery sedan. But consumers pay dearly for that luxury, the longest-range model expected to cost over $100,000. 
 
Tesla is expected to push into the mainstream with a new Model III that will be in production by around 2018. But while it is expected to cost $35,000 after federal credits, the maker hasn’t said what its range will be. 
 
GM, meanwhile, hasn’t said how much it will charge for the new Bolt, which will deliver around 200 miles per charge. A number of other automakers, including Ford, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, are also working on models that they promise will get 200 miles or more. 
 
Nissan, meanwhile, has suggested it will approach that target itself when it finally launches a second-generation version of the Leaf. But it has yet to confirm precisely when that replacement model will come to market.

													You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site.. Nissan Offers Peaceful Rural Getaways in Europe, Japan Thanks to LEAF, e-NV200 Electric Cars. While electric cars like the Nissan LEAF were once marketed as the ultimate urban car, there’s no denying that electric cars really come into their own when cruising silently along peaceful country lanes, accompanied by beautiful vistas and the sounds of nature. 
 
To celebrate that very fact and encourage drivers to enjoy the last few weeks of summer weather before the start of fall, Nissan Europe even produced a video showcasing what it said was the five most breathtaking roads that you could take an electric car along this summer. 
 
In Northern Japan, a car-share scheme means that you can holiday in the historic Snow Country without burning gasoline. 
 
Those routes — including one across the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol UK just miles from our current offices — are indeed well worth trying out for yourself if you happen to live in any of the regions mentioned, but over in Japan Nissan has gone ones step further, combining electric car rental with a holiday in Japan’s famous northern hot spring region. 
 
Enter Tokamachi, a city in in the Niigata Prefecture of Japan. During the winter, thousands of people flock to the city to take part in its famous Snow Festival, the oldest snow festival in the entire nation. But while the city is famous for 10+ feet of winter snow and its annual snow festival, it is also known for its ancient hot springs which sprout up from underground all around the area. 
 
Known as onsen in Japan, these hot springs are revered for their medicinal purposes and have drawn visitors to the region for hundreds of years. A particularly warm  o nsen at the ski resort of Matsunoyama is said to produce water that is near boiling point, thanks to the super hot magma lurking just beneath the earth’s crust in that region. 
 
As a consequence, many Japanese city dwellers book a summer vacation at the resort to unwind and take in the joys of the famous hot spring and tour the beautiful countryside the region has to offer. 
 
But at nearly twenty-three times the size of Tokyo, getting around the region isn’t easy. And while visitors can opt to take their own gasoline cars to explore, Japan’s excellent nationwide fast charging infrastructure for electric cars makes it particularly easy to use an electric car instead. 
 
Which is where Nissan Rent-a-Car and Japan Travel Bureau come in. Working with local onsen inns and other local businesses, visitors to the area allows inn patrons the chance to book online and receive a special IC card that allows them to tour the region in a zero-emission electric car. 
 
Kazunari Yanagi, Senior Vice President at the Chitose inn in Tokamachi, explained that the local history and abundance of geothermal energy made the car sharing program particularly enticing from an environmental point of view. 
 
“Matsunoyama is particularly hot  onsen and spring water nears 98 degrees Celsius, and can produce electricity,” he explained. “We thought that EV car-sharing with the Nissan LEAF would be a good fit for our patrons.” 
 
Thanks to Japan’s famous Bullet Train — which passes by the region — tourists don’t even have to drive from Tokyo to escape the hustle and bustle of megacity life. With the bullet train around an hour to get from Tokyo to the Isen Inn in the Niigata Prefecture for example, customers can ensure their entire holiday is powered by renewable energy. 
 
With bullet trains taking just over an hour to get to this amazing place, LEAF rental keeps the entire trip zero-emissions. 
 
“We currently have an Arts Festival this summer, but we actively try to preserve and promote the Snow Country culture, and the natural environment that we want visitors to experience,” explained Tomohiro Iguchi, President of Isen Co. and head of the Snow Country Tourism Association. “Thus, this combination of Nissan EV car-sharing and regional promotion is a good mix.” 
 
Nissan and Snow Country Tourism Association say the program is already proving popular, with plenty of tourists spending their entire vacation in the region without burning a drop of fossil fuel in the process. While there’s no news if the program will be back next year, we’re guessing its popularity this summer should ensure an extension of the program for many years to come. 
 
We should note at this point of course that using electric vehicles to tour the countryside is no new thing. Half a world away in Wales, the Eco Travel Network joins up tourists in another mountainous and ancient land to the diminutive Renault Twizy two-seat quadricycle. While originally designed as an urban commuter vehicle, the Renault Twizy has proven itself popular with tourists keen to explore the Welsh countryside in complete zero-emissions silence. 
 
Have you been on vacation to somewhere this summer where you’ve been able to hire an electric car to explore? What did you do? Or perhaps there’s a place near you where you’d like to see tourist electric car rentals take off? 
 
Let us know all about them in the Comments below.. Electric-Car Perks Put Norway in a Pinch. Rich subsidies for emissions-free vehicles are straining the finances of a municipal tunnel that collects no fees from an island’s growing population of battery-powered Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S cars.. Photo Feature: A journey through history at Datsun Nissan Heritage Car Garage in Zama, Japan. Hiding quietly behind the walls of Nissan’s facility at Zama is a collection of about 250 cars from the rich history of the brand which started its journey as Datsun in the most recognizable form.
In fact, Nissan as we know it had its earliest roots in a company called Kwaishinsha Motor Works Co. formed in 1911 in Tokyo by Masujiro Hashimoto. At 37 years old, Hashimoto founded the Kwaishinsha, Co.  After graduating from the “School of Industry in Tokyo” in Kuramae, Tokyo Japan, he was then selected by the Japanese government (Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce) as a trainee to study industrial arts in the U.S. for several years.  He was an enthusiastic engineer full of ambition
Masujiro Hashimoto
William R. Gorham
His contemporary, although not a compatriot William R. Gorham formed his own company namely Jitsuyo Jidosha Seizo Co. in  1919 at Osaka.
Both these companies merged in 1926 to form Dat Jidosha Seizo Co. Company’s founder Masujiro Hashimoto had three principal backers, Kenjiro Den, Rokuro Aoyama, Meitaro Takeuchi. The letters D, A and T in the word Datsun represent the first letters of the family names of the trio.
The DAT car, which was originally developed by Kwaishinsha Motor Works, was a relatively large-sized vehicle. However, the Japanese market in the 1930s dictated a need for small, basic, lightweight and economical vehicles. “DATSON” was the name given to the small prototype car with 495cc engine named, meaning “the Son of DAT.” It was later changed in favor of “DATSUN” because “son” in Japanese means “loss”.
Nissan 70 passenger car, the first “NISSAN” branded model was launched in 1937. Later, in July 1981, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced abolishment of Datsun brand globally to enhance its corporate identity. By 1983, Datsun brand had completely been abolished and merged entirely into Nissan brand.
Through all these years, to date, when Datsun has re-emerged as a brand to cater to up and coming markets, the Nissan group has been a dominant force in the world car market. The company’s heritage garage at its Zama Facility chronicles its journey through the sands of time with a rich collection of cars, dating back to the beginning of a hugely successful journey. While the garage is not open for public viewing, occasional tours are organized, only in Japanese language.
We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Tatiana Natarova, DGM, Datsun Global Communications, all the individuals from Nissan-Datsun Japan involved in the activity and our own Indian team of Datsun Nissan communications including Ghazal Javed and Lavanya Wadgaonkar for providing us an opportunity to witness the history of these great brands in the flesh.
In the images below, we have tried to chronicle the history of the brand briefly through images and the story behind every car model. We hope you enjoy it.
Datsun 14 Roadster (1935 : 14)
Jidosha-Seizo Co., Ltd. established in December 1933, became Nissan Motor Co.,Ltd in the following year and started full-scale production. At the company’s new factory in Yokohama, the first car to come off the line was this “14”(April 1935). It was powered by a new 722cc, 15ps engine. A distinguishing feature is the beautiful rabbit mascot created by Ryuichi Tomiya, who worked on the body design.
Datsun Bluebird 1200 Deluxe (1961 : P311)
The Datsun 310 (first-generation Bluebird) was launched in August 1959 as the 1,000cc and 1,200cc series. The first-ever independent front suspension attracted a great deal of attention. Launched in October of the following year, the 311 had an upgraded 1,200cc engine, with output increased from 43PS to 55PS. Its top speed of 120km\/h was the fastest of any domestically produced compact car at that time.
The ‘Dat’ in the name Datsun means rabbit in Japanese, thus a leaping rabbit was chosen as the emblem for the early Datsun cars
With time, the leaping rabbit became more and more discreet in its shape, representing only a blurry outline of a rabbit in motion
Datsun Bluebird 1200 Deluxe (1962 : P312)
The 310 attracted a crowd of 120,000 people to the official launch in 1959, and 20,000 units had been shipped by March of the following year; exports to America had also started. In October 1960, the 310 was introduced; it was equipped with a full-synchromesh transmission. And in September of the following year, the 312 with its larger tail lights appeared. This “Flower Car” vehicle was one of those used in a nationwide campaign, so the body is decorated with each prefecture’s official flower and its governor’s signature.
NISSAN Passenger Car (1938 : 70)
Until the introduction of corporate identity guidelines in 1981, two different car names (brand names) were used: small cars were called “Datsun” while large vehicles were named “Nissan”. The first NISSAN model was made with equipment purchased from an American company, Graham Paige Motors Corp., so the size of the vehicle was comparable to the Fords and Chevrolet at that time. The first car came off the line in March 1937.
Prince Sedan Deluxe (1954 : AISH-2)
Launched in March 1952, this car was named “Prince” in honor of the investiture of Crown Prince Akihito. This commemorative car was the actual vehicle used by the then Crown Prince (the current Emperor). In 1954, it was highly praised at the first Tokyo Motor Show held in Tokyo’s Hibiya district. It was the first domestic car with more than 2 gears to have synchromesh. Maximum engine output was 45PS.
Datsun Bluebird 1300 (1968 : PL411)
This is the final model of the 410 (Nissan Mexicana’s left-hand drive car) launched in September 1963. This was the vehicle provided for the Japanese team at the Mexico Olympics in October 1968 and it was autographed by the whole team on the last day. At these Olympics, Japan excelled in the men’s gymnastics, wrestling, weightlifting and soccer, winning 11 gold, 7 silver, and 7 bronze medals.
Be-1 (1987 : BK10)
Based on a “nostalgic modern” concept, the Be-1 design was well balanced, using rounded features typified by the headlights. The concept extended to the cabin interior, with its full-cloth knit upholstery and round ventilation grilles combining comfort and fun. Notable was its use of recyclable thermoplastic resin (a world first). The canvas top version was launched in March 1987.
Prairie JW-G (1984 : M10)
The first-generation Prairie was a pioneer in the multipurpose RV market, which eventually led to today’s popular minivans. It was launched in August 1982. Thanks to its FF design, it offered two sliding side doors on both sides, without the obstruction of a central pillar, something not seen on any other passenger vehicle at the time. This made getting in and out much easier. The JW-G was an 8-seater; a 5-seater and 3\/6-seater were also available.
Apart from the production cars, there is a separate section for the motorsports machines. We’ll pick a few of them later in the article
Prince Skyline 1500 Deluxe (1965 : S50)
The second-generation Skyline was launched in November 1963. Intended to be a true owner’s car, its design was based on a brand new concept, the complete opposite of the American styling of the large first-generation cars. The advanced, functional styling proved very popular, and TV commercials promoting the maintenance-free “sealed engine” attracted much interest.
Fairlady 280Z-T (1981 : HGS130)
The first-generation Fairlady Z (S30) was announced in October 1969 and launched in November that same year. In Japan, the 240Z was launched two years later in November 1971, followed by the 2\/2 model in January 1974. In July 1976, this car evolved into the S31 (1976 “NAPS”=Nissan Anti-Pollution System= spec.). This Z-T (5-speed, floor shift only) was equipped with aluminum wheels, 195\/70HR14 tires, and remote-controlled mirrors as standard.
President Sovereign (1980 : H252)
As Nissan’s flagship car, this high-quality sedan boasted the best in technology and luxury. The H252 indicates that it was derived from the Cedric Special (50), launched in August 1963. The 250 was launched in 1973, and the 252, which conformed to 1978 exhaust emission regulations, was launched in August 1977. The top-grade Sovereign was equipped with an 4,400cc V8 engine.
Tama Electric Car (1947 : E4S-47-1)
After the war oil was very scarce, but electricity was plentiful. For this reason, there was a period when the government promoted the manufacture of electric vehicles. With this encouragement, the “Tama” was introduced and earned a high reputation: in performance tests (conducted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry) it succeeded in bettering its catalog specifications with a cruising range of 96.3km and a top speed of 35.2km\/h. It was used as a taxi and in similar roles until 1950.
March Collet (1985 : K10)
The first-generation March (K10) was launched in October 1982. In April 1983, the fashionable, high-quality “Collet” was added to the lineup (based on the top grade G). Chic and luxurious, the Collet proved very popular with the young crowd and women. In February 1985, the first minor change was carried out.
Datsun Sunny 1000 Deluxe (1966 : B10)
The B10 was popular with Japan’s “my car” generation. Even before its launch in April 1966 it was a hot topic thanks to teaser ads and the idea of asking the public to name it: “Sunny” was chosen out of 8.5 million entries. It was conveniently priced (Deluxe: \460,000; Standard: \410,000) and within 5 months sales had topped 30,000 units. The 4-door version was added the following year and the coupe a year later.
Nissan R383 (1970 : R383)
Having won the 1969 Japan GP with the R382, Nissan began preparations for a new machine to compete in the 1970 Japan GP. The result was the R383, dubbed “700ps!” Unfortunately, the 1970 Japan GP was cancelled and the R383, without a chance to demonstrate its prodigious ability, became a machine of legend. This commemorative car is a reconstruction (replica) used for motor shows.
Nissan R382 (1969 : R382)
At the previous year’s Japan GP, Nissan had reluctantly used a Chevrolet engine due to the lack of development time. However, entered in the 1969 Japan GP was the R382, which was equipped with Nissan’s own 6-liter V12 DOHC engine (600PS). The R382 dominated the race, beating the Porsche and Toyota 7 to take both 1st place (M. Kurosawa) and 2nd place (H. Kitano).

A case study from the US shows benefits of using clean and renewable energy to power up home and cars outweigh costs, reports The Huffington Post

Steve Schullo and Dan Robertson for The Huffington Post, part of the Climate Publishers Network 

Early adopters are consumers who aspire to own the newest gadget even if it means paying top price. When it came to a renewable energy plan for our home and automobiles, we were no exceptions. Despite the high cost, we wanted our home and two cars dependent on 100% clean and renewable energy. 

Why? Where did we get the money? Was our idealism too expensive? Would this energy cost-saving-investment make a difference in our monthly electric bill? How long could it take to pay for itself? This blog post answers those questions. We took the plunge, began our conversion with 24 solar panels seven years ago and a few years later purchased two 100% electric cars. 

Our primary motivation was to reduce our bills from Southern California Edison, which is the most expensive electric power company in the country, and to take advantage of power company incentives and federal tax credits. 

We had a big-picture motivation too. With our long-term commitment to green consciousness, we support our national goals of clean, renewable, and efficient energy production and consumption. Tesla employs American ingenuity and employees, and supports our home-state California economy. These decisions to convert our home and our cars to 100% renewable energy over the past seven years were obvious ways to support our country and the planet. 

Where did we get the money? 

Because of our 35-year history of frugal living and disciplined investing, we had the financial resources to proceed. Our portfolio’s growth since the 2008 stock market crash was facilitated by self-managing our low-cost, diversified portfolio. Financial advisers are expensive, even the fiduciaries. We figured that our cost of going green was actually less than what we would have paid an adviser, who could have easily eaten 2% per year to manage our portfolio. 

We share below what we paid for solar panels, a Nissan Leaf and a Tesla Model S, and how much we saved in energy costs. Keep in mind that prices for solar panels and electric cars will no doubt decline. The battery is the most expensive part in any electric car. Tesla Motors is planning to build a factory dedicated to creating and producing batteries at lower costs and longer driving range, and it is rolling out the first $35,000 (base price) Model 3 SUV by 2017. By 2020, electric cars and solar panels should be everywhere. 

Case study 

Seven years ago, we installed solar panels on our house. Three and a half years ago, we bought our first electric car and finally 18 months ago, we purchased our second electric car (picture shows our house with solar panels and our cars). In order for these expensive investments to work, we committed for the long-term. During our working careers in Los Angeles, we lived in the same house for decades and we have kept our previous cars for up to 20 years. 

Solar panels 

In 2008, we paid $33,000 for 24 solar panels. We received a federal tax credit of 30% ($11,000). 

Before solar energy, our estimated home power bill averaged about $225 per month. Over the late spring, summer and early fall, AC cooling in our hot desert costs as much as heating a home during the cold winter months in other parts of the country. Our AC and swimming pool water pump increased our bill to about $400 per month during summer months. During the winter, the energy bill dropped to about $175. 

Was it worth it? Yes. Using a conservative estimate of $225 per month, we would have spent $18,900 for electricity for the past seven years (84 months X $225). Instead, with solar power, we spent only $2,940 (about $35 per month X 84 months). We summarise the data below. 

2011 Nissan Leaf and 2014 Tesla Model S 

We paid $37,000 for the Nissan Leaf and $95,506 for the Tesla. We got back $15,000 in federal tax credits and $5,000 in state rebates through the California Clean Vehicle Rebate project. Total government incentives: $20,000. 

Estimating gasoline savings is a bit more complicated. Let us start with the total number of miles we drove our two electric cars: 42,618 miles. Driving this far in our previous gas cars (1999 Lexus and a 1997 Ford Explorer), we would have burned an estimated 2,660 gallons of gasoline. At an average of $3.57 per gallon, we would cost $9,500 over 3.5 years. 

Summary of costs and savings, tax credit and incentives 

Investments: 

33,000 for the 24 solar panels (For the record, SC Edison’s own incentive program of 9,000 has already been subtracted from the solar panel company’s 42,000 price tag). 

37,000 for the Nissan Leaf (Out-the-door price) 

95,506 for the Tesla, Model 6 (Out-the-door price) 

Total Investment Cost:165,506 

Energy savings, tax credits, and incentives: 

9,500 on gasoline over the past 3.5 years driving 42,618 miles. 

11,000 federal tax credit on home solar panels 

15,000 federal tax credits on two electric cars 

5,000 California Clean Vehicle Rebate project for both cars 

15,960 estimated home electric bill savings with solar 

Total savings, tax credits and incentives:56,460 

What does our report of the past seven years mean for the future of our home and auto energy needs? Our out-of-pocket investment cost, a grand total of $165,506, has already been reduced to $109,046, but the savings don’t stop now. It keeps going well into the future. 

Projected energy savings 

Projected savings for our home and automobiles for the next seven years will be about $19,000 in gasoline and $15,960 (seven years again) in home energy. This is an estimated total savings of $34,960. 

Our decision to go green is paying off economically. Our initial costs are gradually being paid back because we continue to save money with our solar production and not needing gasoline. The Tesla purchase will obviously take a long time. Still not convinced? What if we bought two expensive ICEs (internal combustion engines) such as a Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar or BMW? 

Additional benefits of electric cars 

Electric automobiles carry enormous advantages over ICE or conventional cars. One of the important points usually left out of the debate is future maintenance costs. With those ICE cars mentioned above, we would have to purchase expensive gasoline, change the oil, have tune-ups, and smog inspections (California residents). We know what dealers charge to maintain our cars – a rip-off. Emission-free cars can use the carpool lanes as a single driver with a state-issued decal. We already know electric cars are reliable and green (engines always start) – they are also exceptionally simple. They have no filthy and polluting CO2 emissions, no transmissions, no radiators. For example, the only maintenance of our Leaf in 3.5 years was a $14 cabin filter, a factory required brake fluid change for $52 and a tire rotation for $24. 

During the next seven years, we will need to buy tires and possibly have the disc brakes maintained on each car, but that’s it. All ICE cars are an expense – not just gasoline. ICE cars comprise enormous complications with lots of moving parts. Electric cars have much fewer moving parts and thus never require expensive maintenance schedules, so we can keep our cars safely away from dealerships’ costly service programmes! Similarly, we keep our investments away from the greedy big banks, expensive advisers, and Wall Street brokerage firms. 

Do you want to take the plunge? 

We took seven years to implement our plan. You can do the same with your plan by converting slowly as the opportunities present themselves. As the technology costs decrease, the options of either solar panels, a 100% electric car or both may look promising for you. 

The decision to purchase solar energy for your home remains optional. However, cars are necessary. So why not purchase a 100% electric car as a second car? You do not need solar panels to take advantage of your power company’s lower kWh costs. Electric cars are charged between midnight and 6am when the kWh is a fraction of the cost of using power during peak times. Each car has a built-in timer to set when you want the car charged. In California, most utility companies have lower rates for customers owning electric cars. Our company, Edison, charges 11 cents per kWh between 10pm and 8amversus 46 cents during “on-peak” afternoons. 

If you are still deciding to install solar and purchase an electric car, there is good news for you. Solar prices are declining and their energy production per panel is increasing. With the steady development of technology, you will be getting more bang for the buck than we did. Also, ask your local real estate agent if solar panels increase the value of your house for resale. 

Obviously, your choice of an electric car is more complicated. How will you use the car? How far do you commute to work? Are charging stations available on your route to work? Our 110-volt standard home plug-in for our Leaf works fine (Tesla recommends a 220 volt plug-in for a cost of about $500). Some employers offer free charging stations for employees. There a hundreds of charging stations around the country (Click here for a charging station map). Some stations are privately owned and charge a fee, while publicly owned stations in public parking lots, municipalities and most hotels\/motels that offer the service are free (for paid guests). Tesla has its own charging stations. They are free-for-life of the Model S owners, located all over the country, and fast charging. Tesla Motors realise that to sell their cars they must provide support for long-distance drives and 40-minute charging times. 

We hope this is informative enough to get you thinking about converting your home and cars to green. The technology available to us was expensive. But we believe our decision will eventually pay for itself. You will not have to pay nearly as much, so your time committed to a green plan should be shorter. Tesla is a great car, everybody likes the performance and the style. It is the car of the future. In aboutthree years, an affordable model will be available. 

In the meantime, we are benefiting from our green energy plan now. We want to leave a carbon-free footprint and to encourage others. We are happy too that five of our neighbors converted their homes to solar power. That tells us sharing our green foot was worth it! Zero-emission technology is always improving and the future remains a very bright green.. Nissan's New Leaf Features Stronger Battery, Longer Range. NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Nissan  , in an attempt to stimulate consumer interest in its Leaf electric sedan, will offer a version for 2016 with a more powerful battery that extends the car's maximum range between charges by 27%. 
 
Nissan said the new 30-kilowatt battery for the two most expensive versions of the Leaf will increase the vehicle's maximum range to 107 miles from the current range of 84 miles with a 24-kilowatt battery. 
 
The price for the two longer-range models are $35,050 and $37,640, including destination charges but before application of a $7,500 federal tax credit for purchase of any battery-powered car. The price increases for the two top models are $2,100 and $1,670, respectively, over the 2015 models. 
 
Nissan shares this year roughly have paralleled those of the Nikkei index of large-capitalization Japanese industrial stocks, rising in value by about 6% while the Nikkei has increased about 5%. Nissan is an affiliate of the French automaker Renault and a member of the Renault Nissan Alliance , which shares technology, designs and manufacturing facilities. 
 
With gasoline prices falling, consumer demand for alternative-fuel vehicles has waned. Through August, Nissan sold 12,383 Leafs in the U.S., down about a third from last year. The national average for a gallon of unleaded regular stood at $2.40 a gallon at the end of the summer driving season , down $1.04 from a year earlier. 
 
But lower gasoline prices may not be the only or primary reason why sales of electric vehicles and of gas-electric hybrids like the Toyota  Prius are weak. Consumer interest in the technology may be fading, especially as conventional automobiles become more and more fuel-efficient thanks to advanced internal combustion engines and use of lighter materials in vehicle construction. 
 
General Motors is introducing a new version of the Chevrolet Volt extended range electric for 2016, and Toyota will bring out an advanced Prius gas-electric hybrid -- both in an effort to reverse sales declines. 
 
""A lot of drivers got interested in alternative-fuel vehicles because they wanted to be more fuel-efficient and ecologically sensitive,"" said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kbb.com. ""Once they can drive a car that gets more than 30 miles per gallon -- even if its an internal combustion engine -- they say, 'I'm good.'"" 
 
For example, a midsize Chevrolet Cruze with a conventional two-liter engine is rated to give a combined city-highway fuel efficiency of 33 mpg, implying that a typical driver will spend less than $1,200 for gasoline. 
 
Automakers have spent billions developing alternative-fuel vehicles like the Leaf in anticipation of tighter regulations worldwide to reduce the emissions of CO2, produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. In California and other states, a fixed percentage of vehicles sold by each manufacturer soon must be emission-free , hence, the development of cars powered by batteries and fuel cells, which run on hydrogen and emit only water vapor.

September 22, 2015 Carbon Pricing Surges Across Major Multinational Related Topics Carbon FinanceCarbon Finance & OffsetsCarbon FootprintCarbon ManagementCarbon Offsets\/RECsClimateEmissionsFinance & ReportingGlobal Putting a price on carbon emissions is going mainstream, according to new disclosures provided to CDP, which finds major multinationals including Allergan, Campbell’s Soup, Colgate-Palmolive, Stanley Black & Decker, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Nestle, Microsoft and Nissan are among the 437 companies using carbon pricing to offset the costs and risks of their greenhouse gas emissions production. CDP saw a tripling in the number of companies reporting that they use carbon pricing over last year (437 up from 150 in 2014), which the report says highlights the rise of big name brands across all industries putting a price on their climate risk. An additional 583 companies say they plan to use an internal carbon price within the next two years, including Yahoo! and China’s power giant, CLP Holdings. Together, more than 1,000 companies disclose to their key stakeholders that they currently price their carbon emissions — or intend to in the next two years — to try to meet their climate change risks. In Asia, more than 10 times as many corporations disclosed they put an internal price on their carbon emissions this year — 93 in total up from eight in 2014 — pointing to the influence of China’s expected carbon trading scheme and the new carbofn market in South Korea. Among them are LG in TV and telecom, IT giant NEC, and Hitachi. An internal price on carbon — where a price is applied to each metric ton of CO2 — is used as a planning tool by businesses across all industries and geographies, with the majority in Europe and strong representation from North America. Corporations chose to use the prices applied (ranging from $1 per metric ton to $357 per metric ton) as part of their efforts to mitigate risk from current or potential regulation; drive investments in clean energy purchases or other GHG reduction activities and to prioritize energy efficiency.

Photo Feature: A journey through history at Datsun Nissan Heritage Car Garage in Zama, Japan. Hiding quietly behind the walls of Nissan’s facility at Zama is a collection of about 250 cars from the rich history of the brand which started its journey as Datsun in the most recognizable form.
In fact, Nissan as we know it had its earliest roots in a company called Kwaishinsha Motor Works Co. formed in 1911 in Tokyo by Masujiro Hashimoto. At 37 years old, Hashimoto founded the Kwaishinsha, Co.  After graduating from the “School of Industry in Tokyo” in Kuramae, Tokyo Japan, he was then selected by the Japanese government (Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce) as a trainee to study industrial arts in the U.S. for several years.  He was an enthusiastic engineer full of ambition
Masujiro Hashimoto
William R. Gorham
His contemporary, although not a compatriot William R. Gorham formed his own company namely Jitsuyo Jidosha Seizo Co. in  1919 at Osaka.
Both these companies merged in 1926 to form Dat Jidosha Seizo Co. Company’s founder Masujiro Hashimoto had three principal backers, Kenjiro Den, Rokuro Aoyama, Meitaro Takeuchi. The letters D, A and T in the word Datsun represent the first letters of the family names of the trio.
The DAT car, which was originally developed by Kwaishinsha Motor Works, was a relatively large-sized vehicle. However, the Japanese market in the 1930s dictated a need for small, basic, lightweight and economical vehicles. “DATSON” was the name given to the small prototype car with 495cc engine named, meaning “the Son of DAT.” It was later changed in favor of “DATSUN” because “son” in Japanese means “loss”.
Nissan 70 passenger car, the first “NISSAN” branded model was launched in 1937. Later, in July 1981, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced abolishment of Datsun brand globally to enhance its corporate identity. By 1983, Datsun brand had completely been abolished and merged entirely into Nissan brand.
Through all these years, to date, when Datsun has re-emerged as a brand to cater to up and coming markets, the Nissan group has been a dominant force in the world car market. The company’s heritage garage at its Zama Facility chronicles its journey through the sands of time with a rich collection of cars, dating back to the beginning of a hugely successful journey. While the garage is not open for public viewing, occasional tours are organized, only in Japanese language.
We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Tatiana Natarova, DGM, Datsun Global Communications, all the individuals from Nissan-Datsun Japan involved in the activity and our own Indian team of Datsun Nissan communications including Ghazal Javed and Lavanya Wadgaonkar for providing us an opportunity to witness the history of these great brands in the flesh.
In the images below, we have tried to chronicle the history of the brand briefly through images and the story behind every car model. We hope you enjoy it.
Datsun 14 Roadster (1935 : 14)
Jidosha-Seizo Co., Ltd. established in December 1933, became Nissan Motor Co.,Ltd in the following year and started full-scale production. At the company’s new factory in Yokohama, the first car to come off the line was this “14”(April 1935). It was powered by a new 722cc, 15ps engine. A distinguishing feature is the beautiful rabbit mascot created by Ryuichi Tomiya, who worked on the body design.
Datsun Bluebird 1200 Deluxe (1961 : P311)
The Datsun 310 (first-generation Bluebird) was launched in August 1959 as the 1,000cc and 1,200cc series. The first-ever independent front suspension attracted a great deal of attention. Launched in October of the following year, the 311 had an upgraded 1,200cc engine, with output increased from 43PS to 55PS. Its top speed of 120km\/h was the fastest of any domestically produced compact car at that time.
The ‘Dat’ in the name Datsun means rabbit in Japanese, thus a leaping rabbit was chosen as the emblem for the early Datsun cars
With time, the leaping rabbit became more and more discreet in its shape, representing only a blurry outline of a rabbit in motion
Datsun Bluebird 1200 Deluxe (1962 : P312)
The 310 attracted a crowd of 120,000 people to the official launch in 1959, and 20,000 units had been shipped by March of the following year; exports to America had also started. In October 1960, the 310 was introduced; it was equipped with a full-synchromesh transmission. And in September of the following year, the 312 with its larger tail lights appeared. This “Flower Car” vehicle was one of those used in a nationwide campaign, so the body is decorated with each prefecture’s official flower and its governor’s signature.
NISSAN Passenger Car (1938 : 70)
Until the introduction of corporate identity guidelines in 1981, two different car names (brand names) were used: small cars were called “Datsun” while large vehicles were named “Nissan”. The first NISSAN model was made with equipment purchased from an American company, Graham Paige Motors Corp., so the size of the vehicle was comparable to the Fords and Chevrolet at that time. The first car came off the line in March 1937.
Prince Sedan Deluxe (1954 : AISH-2)
Launched in March 1952, this car was named “Prince” in honor of the investiture of Crown Prince Akihito. This commemorative car was the actual vehicle used by the then Crown Prince (the current Emperor). In 1954, it was highly praised at the first Tokyo Motor Show held in Tokyo’s Hibiya district. It was the first domestic car with more than 2 gears to have synchromesh. Maximum engine output was 45PS.
Datsun Bluebird 1300 (1968 : PL411)
This is the final model of the 410 (Nissan Mexicana’s left-hand drive car) launched in September 1963. This was the vehicle provided for the Japanese team at the Mexico Olympics in October 1968 and it was autographed by the whole team on the last day. At these Olympics, Japan excelled in the men’s gymnastics, wrestling, weightlifting and soccer, winning 11 gold, 7 silver, and 7 bronze medals.
Be-1 (1987 : BK10)
Based on a “nostalgic modern” concept, the Be-1 design was well balanced, using rounded features typified by the headlights. The concept extended to the cabin interior, with its full-cloth knit upholstery and round ventilation grilles combining comfort and fun. Notable was its use of recyclable thermoplastic resin (a world first). The canvas top version was launched in March 1987.
Prairie JW-G (1984 : M10)
The first-generation Prairie was a pioneer in the multipurpose RV market, which eventually led to today’s popular minivans. It was launched in August 1982. Thanks to its FF design, it offered two sliding side doors on both sides, without the obstruction of a central pillar, something not seen on any other passenger vehicle at the time. This made getting in and out much easier. The JW-G was an 8-seater; a 5-seater and 3\/6-seater were also available.
Apart from the production cars, there is a separate section for the motorsports machines. We’ll pick a few of them later in the article
Prince Skyline 1500 Deluxe (1965 : S50)
The second-generation Skyline was launched in November 1963. Intended to be a true owner’s car, its design was based on a brand new concept, the complete opposite of the American styling of the large first-generation cars. The advanced, functional styling proved very popular, and TV commercials promoting the maintenance-free “sealed engine” attracted much interest.
Fairlady 280Z-T (1981 : HGS130)
The first-generation Fairlady Z (S30) was announced in October 1969 and launched in November that same year. In Japan, the 240Z was launched two years later in November 1971, followed by the 2\/2 model in January 1974. In July 1976, this car evolved into the S31 (1976 “NAPS”=Nissan Anti-Pollution System= spec.). This Z-T (5-speed, floor shift only) was equipped with aluminum wheels, 195\/70HR14 tires, and remote-controlled mirrors as standard.
President Sovereign (1980 : H252)
As Nissan’s flagship car, this high-quality sedan boasted the best in technology and luxury. The H252 indicates that it was derived from the Cedric Special (50), launched in August 1963. The 250 was launched in 1973, and the 252, which conformed to 1978 exhaust emission regulations, was launched in August 1977. The top-grade Sovereign was equipped with an 4,400cc V8 engine.
Tama Electric Car (1947 : E4S-47-1)
After the war oil was very scarce, but electricity was plentiful. For this reason, there was a period when the government promoted the manufacture of electric vehicles. With this encouragement, the “Tama” was introduced and earned a high reputation: in performance tests (conducted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry) it succeeded in bettering its catalog specifications with a cruising range of 96.3km and a top speed of 35.2km\/h. It was used as a taxi and in similar roles until 1950.
March Collet (1985 : K10)
The first-generation March (K10) was launched in October 1982. In April 1983, the fashionable, high-quality “Collet” was added to the lineup (based on the top grade G). Chic and luxurious, the Collet proved very popular with the young crowd and women. In February 1985, the first minor change was carried out.
Datsun Sunny 1000 Deluxe (1966 : B10)
The B10 was popular with Japan’s “my car” generation. Even before its launch in April 1966 it was a hot topic thanks to teaser ads and the idea of asking the public to name it: “Sunny” was chosen out of 8.5 million entries. It was conveniently priced (Deluxe: \460,000; Standard: \410,000) and within 5 months sales had topped 30,000 units. The 4-door version was added the following year and the coupe a year later.
Nissan R383 (1970 : R383)
Having won the 1969 Japan GP with the R382, Nissan began preparations for a new machine to compete in the 1970 Japan GP. The result was the R383, dubbed “700ps!” Unfortunately, the 1970 Japan GP was cancelled and the R383, without a chance to demonstrate its prodigious ability, became a machine of legend. This commemorative car is a reconstruction (replica) used for motor shows.
Nissan R382 (1969 : R382)
At the previous year’s Japan GP, Nissan had reluctantly used a Chevrolet engine due to the lack of development time. However, entered in the 1969 Japan GP was the R382, which was equipped with Nissan’s own 6-liter V12 DOHC engine (600PS). The R382 dominated the race, beating the Porsche and Toyota 7 to take both 1st place (M. Kurosawa) and 2nd place (H. Kitano).

Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (NSANY - Snapshot Report) recently launched the 2016 all-electric LEAF with an advanced battery. The new battery is standard for LEAF SV and LEAF SL models. The vehicle and its batteries are being assembled at Nissan's Smyrna, TN assembly plant. 

The new vehicle will be powered by a 30 kWh battery which will provide an EPA-estimated range of 107 miles. This is 27% higher than the previous battery capacity of 24 kWH. The 2016 model also offers an improved IT system which is user-friendly and provides better connectivity. 

Nissan gained a leading position in the electric vehicle market with the launch of LEAF in Dec 2010. However, in order to maintain its dominance, the company needs to focus on developing batteries with better capacity, packaging and durability at affordable prices. 

All the LEAF models feature an 80kW AC synchronous motor which generates 107 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque. This feature provides a highly responsive and fun-to-drive experience. Notably, electric vehicles ensure no emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. 

Meanwhile, the company is planning an audio and connectivity upgrade by adding NissanConnect to Mobile Apps of LEAF’s S models. NissanConnect can be accessed through a 5.0-inch color display in the vehicle. In the SV and SL models, the company will offer NissanConnect with Navigation and Mobile Apps – featuring a 7.0-inch color display with multi-touch control and Nissan Voice Recognition. 

The NissanConnect system for LEAF models offers remote connection to the vehicle. With this, consumers can monitor a battery-charge, start charging event control and turn on the heating and air conditioning system before physically entering the vehicle. 

The starting price of a 2016 Nissan LEAF SV model will be $26,700, after federal tax credit of $7,500. The LEAF SL has been priced at $29,290, after federal tax credit. Nissan will offer the LEAF S models with a 24 kWh battery with an EPA-estimated range of 84 miles. The price for 2016 Nissan LEAF S grade remains at $21,510, after deducting the federal tax incentive.

Drivers who opt for the SV or SL trim levels should see up to 107 miles between recharges. John Murphy\/Nissan USA The new 30-kWh battery pack will be standard equipment on the upper-tier SV and SL trim levels and will bump the estimated cruising range to 107 miles between charges. Nissan's release makes no mention of new technology at work here, so it appears that this is just a 27-percent bigger version of the same advanced lithium ion battery as before. Nissan says that the bigger battery pushes the 2016 Leaf to the top of its class for EV range, edging out the 93-mile Kia Soul EV for the win. Though, if Chevrolet makes good on its claimed 200-mile range for the upcoming Bolt EV, Nissan may not hold the crown for long. The Leaf's base S trim level will retain the current 24-kWh pack and 84-mile range, which is in line with the class average of around 80 miles. (That class includes other EV hatchbacks such as the Ford Focus Electric, Volkswagen e-Golf, Chevrolet Spark EV and Honda Fit EV.)
Beyond the battery, the 2016 Leaf's electric power train remains unchanged. Electric power is converted to 187 pound-feet of physical torque by an 80-kw (107-horsepower) AC synchronous motor and that torque reaches the ground at the front wheels via a single-speed transmission.
In addition to the bigger battery, the 2016 Leaf will also see tweaked cabin technology packaging and three new premium color choices. John Murphy\/Nissan USA In the cabin, the latest Leaf sees a minor tech upgrade that makes the NissanConnect infotainment system and its mobile apps suite standard across all trim levels. Drivers will interact with the system via a 5-inch touch display in the base S model or a larger 7-inch screen in the SV and SL models. The upper trim levels also continue to offer Nissan's connected navigation system, with its database of charging stations, and the NissanConnect EV service, which allows drivers to remotely monitor and control their Leaf's charging state and other vehicle systems via an app or Web portal.
The new Leaf will also be available in three new exterior colors: Forged Bronze, Coulis Red and Deep Blue Pearl.
The 2016 Nissan Leaf S will start at $29,010 before a $7,500 federal tax incentive, but the connected features and cruising range improvements now make the upper trim levels so much more compelling than this base model. The SV model starts at $34,200 before the federal tax credit and the top-trim SL model with its leather interior, 30-minute Quick Charge port and LED headlamps steps up to $36,790 with the same available tax incentive.

Autocar reports that not only will it be previewed in concept form at the Frankfurt auto show, but that it will go on sale in 2017.How did we get to this point?For starters, the current 370Z will be allowed to expire by 2017. As its replacement, Nissan had been considering a smaller coupe as a possibility, previewing it in concept form at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. The IDx would have been powered by a four-cylinder engine, and would have been a throwback to the packaging offered by the Datsun Z cars of the 1970s.The company has chosen not to go that route, and has indicated that it will instead market a small sports crossover.Nissan executives have indicated that the company will not be rehashing the same formula or trying to improve upon the 370Z directly.“I don’t think the next one [Z car] is going to be the 390Z,"" the company's design chief, Shiro Nakamura, told the Australian media. ""It’s not growing because it’s already big enough. You know, 350 started with 240, 300, 350 and then came 370. I don’t think we should go higher.""Why might this signal a change in vehicle type? Nissan executives already feel that a new approach is needed for the Z to avoid pushing the car up against the Nissan GT-R.
PHOTO GALLERY: Nissan IDx conceptsThe Kicks.""We need to take another path,"" Nakamura continued. ""I feel Z needs more revolution than evolution. I think GT-R has to stay the most high-performance symbol of Nissan technology and Z is a more affordable sports car or a sporty car to get the younger people.""Autocar reports, citing an insider source, that the crossover will make use of Renault-Nissan's CMF B platform, and that it's expected to use the 1.6-liter turbo engine in the Renault Clio RS 220 Trophy, which in the French hatch produces 220 hp and 191 pounds-feet of torque. That means the 3.7-liter V-6 engine will be out, getting the new Z car down a few branches on the price tree, which the 370Z had been climbing as it gained power and luxury materials.The Z crossover, when it debuts, is expected to be around the same size as the Nissan Juke, and will likely borrow the six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission from the Renault Clio RS 220 Trophy, this time pairing it with all-wheel drive.When might we see it on sale? Autocar predicts it'll be out right around the time the 370Z heads out, in early 2017.Contact Automotive NewsTags: EngineeringTechnologyFrankfurt Motor showPerformanceEnginesCars and ConceptsNissanCrossoverSports car   Print Reprints RespondHave an opinion about this story?

We’re Asking the Wrong Question about Electrification. At the recent Fleet Technology Expo in Long Beach, California, Tesla Motors’ co-founder and founder of Wrightspeed , Ian Wright, delivered a keynote to the gathering of fleet managers, suppliers, and consultants that turned the conventional wisdom of vehicle electrification on its ear. While mandates like the California Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program and various federal and state tax incentives seek to displace millions of fossil fuel-burning vehicles with electric equivalents, Wright says we’re asking entirely the wrong question. Rather than asking how to maximize the efficiency of the mass of vehicles, Wright said we should be asking: “How do we save the most fuel per vehicle per year?” 
 
On the surface, those might seem like the same question. However, when you actually start doing the math, the resulting answer is quite different. Vehicle emissions, including CO2, are directly related to how much fuel is consumed. Unfortunately, most people tend to think of efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). When we plot fuel consumed versus mpg , the consumption curve asymptotically approaches zero as mileage goes up. In fact, the curve of incremental fuel savings flattens out dramatically at about 35–40 mpg. Beyond that, increasing mileage comes at a very high cost with little to actually show for it in terms of reductions in total energy use and emissions. 
 
The big gains come when you start from very low mpg, where each incremental improvement yields much larger reductions in fuel consumption. That’s where Wright has focused his efforts in recent years. Wright joined Tesla co-founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and financial backer Elon Musk early on in 2003 to help the tech entrepreneurs with the technical aspects of actually building a car. While Wright left Tesla long before the Roadster finally went to customers in 2008, he continued working on electrification. 
 
Different Solutions for Different Applications 
 
Wrightspeed has developed a micro-turbine, range-extended powertrain system for medium and heavy duty trucks, the vehicles with the biggest potential for fuel savings because they use the most fuel. These big trucks typically only achieve 3–4 mpg running on diesel and even less on natural gas. While the Nissan LEAF or Chevrolet Volt can save individual owners hundreds of dollars a year in fuel compared to similar gasoline-fueled models, the actual amount of fuel saved is relatively small. 
 
A refuse truck is an ideal application for hybridization since it operates at relatively low speeds and makes hundreds of stops and starts per day. In order to get the 130–150-mile range needed for its daily rounds, a fully electric version would need to carry so many batteries it would consume more than half its payload; however, a plug-in hybrid with 30 miles of electric range is entirely viable. Wrightspeed developed its geared traction drive, a 250 hp unit that integrates a traction motor, two-speed gearbox, and inverter, to provide propulsion and regenerative braking. In combination with a small 80 kW turbine range extender sized to run at its optimal efficiency, Wright claims the system delivers a 50% reduction in fuel consumption, saving $35,000 in fuel and $20,000 in maintenance per vehicle annually with a 3–4-year payback time. 
 
Navigant Research’s Automotive Fuel Efficiency Technologies report projects that a wide variety of solutions will be required to meet future efficiency and emissions targets. In order to get the maximum overall benefit, we need to ask Wright’s question and pick the best solution for each application—not one solution for every application.. ​2016 Nissan Leaf gets new battery option, best-in-class 107-mile range. ​2016 Nissan Leaf gets new battery option, best-in-class 107-mile range Nissan boosts the zero-emissions range of the 2016 Leaf to the head of the class by cramming in a bigger battery. by Antuan Goodwin @antgoo September 10, 2015 11:46 AM PDT Updated: September 10, 2015 1:18 PM PDT Not much has changed externally for the 2016 Nissan Leaf -- the Leaf is now entering its fifth year of production -- but the automaker announced September 10 that the electric car will be getting a new, larger battery option and a step up to what it claims is best-in-class range.
Drivers who opt for the SV or SL trim levels should see up to 107 miles between recharges. John Murphy\/Nissan USA The new 30-kWh battery pack will be standard equipment on the upper-tier SV and SL trim levels and will bump the estimated cruising range to 107 miles between charges. Nissan's release makes no mention of new technology at work here, so it appears that this is just a 27-percent bigger version of the same advanced lithium ion battery as before. Nissan says that the bigger battery pushes the 2016 Leaf to the top of its class for EV range, edging out the 93-mile Kia Soul EV for the win. Though, if Chevrolet makes good on its claimed 200-mile range for the upcoming Bolt EV, Nissan may not hold the crown for long. The Leaf's base S trim level will retain the current 24-kWh pack and 84-mile range, which is in line with the class average of around 80 miles. (That class includes other EV hatchbacks such as the Ford Focus Electric, Volkswagen e-Golf, Chevrolet Spark EV and Honda Fit EV.)
Beyond the battery, the 2016 Leaf's electric power train remains unchanged. Electric power is converted to 187 pound-feet of physical torque by an 80-kw (107-horsepower) AC synchronous motor and that torque reaches the ground at the front wheels via a single-speed transmission.
In addition to the bigger battery, the 2016 Leaf will also see tweaked cabin technology packaging and three new premium color choices. John Murphy\/Nissan USA In the cabin, the latest Leaf sees a minor tech upgrade that makes the NissanConnect infotainment system and its mobile apps suite standard across all trim levels. Drivers will interact with the system via a 5-inch touch display in the base S model or a larger 7-inch screen in the SV and SL models. The upper trim levels also continue to offer Nissan's connected navigation system, with its database of charging stations, and the NissanConnect EV service, which allows drivers to remotely monitor and control their Leaf's charging state and other vehicle systems via an app or Web portal.
The new Leaf will also be available in three new exterior colors: Forged Bronze, Coulis Red and Deep Blue Pearl.
The 2016 Nissan Leaf S will start at $29,010 before a $7,500 federal tax incentive, but the connected features and cruising range improvements now make the upper trim levels so much more compelling than this base model. The SV model starts at $34,200 before the federal tax credit and the top-trim SL model with its leather interior, 30-minute Quick Charge port and LED headlamps steps up to $36,790 with the same available tax incentive.

It is a story that began more than 40 years ago. 
 
Nissan saw an opportunity to demonstrate the quality and performance of our vehicles in some of the toughest, most demanding environments on the planet. 
 
We took the iconic 240Z that was built for the asphalt, and re engineered it to rule off road, on desert tracks in Kenya , Uganda , and Tanzania . 
 
Using expertise gained from Nissan's tough 4x4 range, the sports car was given a raised ride height and extra protection. It was perhaps Nissan's first crossover - and it proved its mettle time and time again. 
 
Examples of this kind of thinking populate our history 
 
Because Nissan is in the habit of forging a different path... 
 
And finding new ways of adapting to changing environments. 
 
Today, you will see our latest thinking... with an example of how we are poised to change the landscape... yet again. 
 
SHIRO NAKAMURA , Senior Vice President and Chief Creative Officer 
 
Good afternoon. 
 
At Nissan , we have a history of forging our own path... and of inventing new segments. The Nissan Gripz Concept, the latest proof of that effort. 
 
This concept demonstrates how a crossover...can evolve to become a performance car, what we call 'Crossover Sport... 
 
Crossover Sport suggests a sense of duality. It is capable of off-road and city driving... and features our newest technology, series hybrid, Pure drive e-power. 
 
With Gripz, we extend the boundaries of crossover inspired by our rally racing heritage. 
 
It is very sporty, and captures a sense of performance, from the matte black hood to the duck tail rear end. 
 
Gripz represents the very latest Nissan signature, v-motion front, boomerang headlamps, and floating roof... but it demonstrates the further evolution of Nissan design. 
 
In its proportion... in its attitude...and in its form language... Gripz is highly sculptual and expressive. It is what we call, 'emotional geometry.' 
 
You see the two-plus-two package. The interior is very lean and very light, with racing bicycle inspired carbon frame and molded seats. 
 
The Nissan Gripz Concept. It draws inspiration from the past... but this is thoroughly for the future. 
 
Thank you... 
 
PAUL WILLCOX , Chairman, Nissan Europe 
 
Thanks Shiro. So we have created a new type of crossover. But it's not just about the looks. 
 
What if it used all of Nissan's expertise in electric vehicles, sports cars and 4x4s to create the most crossed over of crossovers? 
 
No car maker is better qualified to do something so bold. Nissan pioneered and still leads the crossover sector with the X-Trail, Qashqai and Juke. 
 
Each of these cars is truly innovative and exciting. 
 
And when other manufacturers look to respond in kind, they find- time and time again, that Nissan , has raised the bar even higher. 
 
Like the Qashqai, Juke and X-Trail, the Gripz offers something new. 
 
It is a fresh perspective on what a sports car can and arguably should be 
 
Like all Nissans, the Gripz is designed to be efficient and easy to drive. 
 
A small petrol engine powers a series hybrid powertrain. 
 
Like the bikes which inspired elements of the styling, you can use the Gripz every day for commuting and then at the weekend it can be used for fun. 
 
This is where Nissan's 4x4 expertise comes in. 
 
Our experience has also been used to create the all new NP300 Navara, seen here in Europe for the first time. 
 
Developed especially for Europe , it's everything you would expect from a tough 4x4 pick up with a one ton carrying capacity, but it features the refinement, quality, efficiency and technology from our crossover range 
 
But while Navara is a traditional 4x4, the Gripz uses parts of the LEAF's EV powertrain to drive the wheels. 
 
If the driver selects 4x4 mode it offers ultimate traction for slippery conditions such as mud and snow. 
 
If the driver is really in an enthusiastic mood, it is the final setting which will offer the most fun. 
 
Select 'drift' mode and the Gripz will make the most of the electric motor's torque and power to give the feeling of a rear-drive sports car. 
 
And just like our current crossovers, the Gripz is packed with technology. 
 
A key building block to autonomous drive is Around View Monitor - a system which uses four cameras to protect the car and its occupants. 
 
It's already fitted to all of Nissan's crossovers and now the new Navara too. 
 
The Gripz takes this to the next level, with the cameras built into the headlamps. 
 
This allows drivers to record their everyday driving on the road like a conventional dashcam - and will also document adventures on the track or off-road. 
 
In another first, the cameras can also stream live to the internet and can be accessed remotely via smartphone if the security system is triggered. 
 
If this all sounds futuristic, that should be no surprise coming from Nissan . 
 
We're the brand that consistently delivers important innovations that advance the future of mobility, especially when it comes to Electric Vehicles. 
 
Today, we're here to announce that the Best-Selling EV in the world just got better. 
 
The Nissan LEAF now gives drivers up to 250 km of electric motoring range, beating all of its competitors in the industry with a 26% increase over the last LEAF. 
 
250 km transforms the driving experience. 
 
250 km opens the world of EV to thousands of drivers across Europe , who before just weren't completely confident that an EV would work for them. 
 
In short, 250 km can change your life. 
 
Now, most current LEAF owners are happy with their range. 
 
In fact, our LEAF drivers are the most satisfied customers we've ever seen. 
 
But this extra range will make EV ownership an easy first choice for many, many more drivers. 
 
We've also upgraded the LEAF's telematics system, responding to the increasing need for a connected car. 
 
Five years ago, when we introduced the Nissan LEAF, we set out a bold vision to pioneer a zero-emissions society. 
 
Now, as we approach 200,000 on the road globally, the LEAF is the best-selling EV of all time, both in Europe and around the world. 
 
And our conviction has only strengthened. 
 
We see a day when every Nissan could be electric, including our sportiest offerings, like the Gripz. 
 
Our expertise in EV technology, developed over decades of R&D work and honed in the marketplace over the last five years, makes Nissan uniquely qualified to define the future of mobility. 
 
At Nissan , we take the attitude that the future is ours to shape, and... the best way to predict what the customer will want, is to create it now. 
 
The concepts we develop are designed to introduce new ideas.. 
 
Not only do they signal our design direction, and where we are going as a brand, but they serve to advance our thinking, in the areas of powertrains, technology, quality, and safety 
 
Innovations like these have helped make us the best-selling Asian brand in Europe , today. 
 
A new sports car, but in the shape and form of a crossover? 
 
An affordable zero-emission family car with a 250km range? 
 
And a tough 4x4 pick up with the technology, refinement and style of a crossover? 
 
This is just the latest in our efforts to deliver on Innovation that Excites. 
 
THANK YOU 
 
(c) 2015 Electronic News Publishing -, source ENP Newswire. 2015 Frankfurt – IAA: The Nissan Gripz Concept may actually replace the Z car outright. We’re heard some frightening and sad rumors in the recent past about the possibility of a new Nissan crossover replacing the famous Nissan Z sports coupe and convertible , and a concept of said crossover was to show up at the Frankfurt Motor Show, currently happening in Germany. Now, that concept is here for the world to see and it’s called the Nissan Gripz Concept. But is it really a pitch at a crossover SUV replacement for the 370Z? 
 
Revealed at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, it’s essentially a sporty crossover SUV inspired by racing bicycles and desert rally cars…ok. Though it makes slightly more sense when Nissan also mentions that the Gripz Concept is also themed after the original 240Z victor from the 1971 Safari Rally. But get this: Nissan even goes as far to say that the original 240Z desert racer was one of its “first crossovers.” Right… 
 
Anyway, the Gripz basically comes off as a mashup between the current Nissan 370Z and the Nissan Juke, in a sort of lifted Hyundai Veloster sort of way. In fact, it sits roughly seven inches taller than the 370Z, eliminating any chance of the Gripz as being a true sports car. 
 

 
Further ruining any chance of the Gripz being a solid performer is the powertrain, a newer and modified version of the Nissan Leaf’s EV powerplant, though its mated to a gas-powered “range-extender” motor, which functions solely to power the electric motor. 
 
Specifics and details about that motor weren’t published, but either way, is the Gripz really going to replace the Nissan Z? We’re not so sure, and if anything, it’s most likely providing more of a glimpse at the next-generation Nissan Juke, which could be heavily inspired by Nissan’s Z halo car. That would be the more sensible interpretation rather than thinking the Gripz is going to replace the Z outright.

Nissan Gripz Concept: A radical sports crossover 
 
Dramatic 2+2 takes Crossover concept to a new level 
 
A new breed of sporty compact crossover for a new, younger generation 
 Inspired by classic desert rally cars and racing bicycles 
 Packed with EV technology, based on Series hybrid system “Pure Drive” e-Power 
 Introducing “emotional geometry” design language from Nissan 
 Built in “dashcam” cameras take Nissan’s safety technology to a new level 
 FRANKFURT – Crossover pioneer Nissan has revealed a new concept car that points to an innovative new future for the brand. Conceived by designers in Europe and Japan, the Nissan Gripz Concept blends the ability and practicality of a compact crossover with the excitement and performance of a sports car. 
 
Infused with an exciting and adventurous feel – thanks to its radical design and advanced powertrain concept – the Nissan Gripz Concept is Nissan’s next move as a game changer. It is a glimpse of how a future compact crossover from the pioneer of the segment might look. 
 
The Nissan Gripz Concept is designed as a car with a dual personality – a vehicle that can handle the day-to-day commute and deliver a genuine adventure at the weekend. 
 
In the same way a cyclist will use a bike to get to work and then head out on that same machine for an adrenaline fuelled ride when the working day is over, so too can the driver of the Nissan Gripz Concept tackle the city streets during the week before enjoying a drive over a mountain pass on a day off. 
 
Inspiration 
 Although maintaining a similar footprint to a compact crossover, the Nissan Gripz Concept has the silhouette of a sports car with a raised ride height, equipped to conquer more challenging driving conditions. 
 
The result pays homage to one of Nissan’s first “crossovers” – the iconic Safari Rally-winning Nissan 240Z. In the 1970s, these sports cars were re-engineered using expertise gathered from Nissan’s 4×4 range to cope with the demanding conditions of the Baja Peninsula, the open plains of Kenya, Uganda and present day Tanzania. These rally racers featured a raised ride height, toughened suspension and sported a matte-black finish for the bonnet and trunk set against a deep red-orange body color. 
 
The Nissan 240Zs were proof that sports cars didn’t have to be low to the ground to be fun. The Nissan Gripz Concept proves this again – incorporating Nissan’s expertise in crossovers, 4x4s, sports cars, and to bring it fully up to date for the new generation, electric powertrain prowess. 
 
Powertrain 
 The Nissan Gripz Concept is equipped with an EV technology based Series hybrid system “Pure Drive e-Power.” An efficient gasoline engine is used to power the electric motor found in the Nissan LEAF. 
 
The powertrain combines Nissan’s various control technologies from its years of experience developing EVs. This configuration delivers smooth, swift and linear acceleration in near-silence, with supreme efficiency. As a result, the Nissan Gripz Concept offers a smooth, refined and exhilarating driving experience with outstanding fuel efficiency. 
 
Design 
 The Nissan Gripz Concept is seen as a design statement rather than a replacement for an existing model, although it does feature cues from Nissan’s new “emotional geometry” design language. 
 
The Crossover concept incorporates four key design elements first seen in Europe on the Nissan Sway, one of the stars of the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. As with Sway, Gripz features a V-motion grille, boomerang lamps front and rear, a floating roof and a kicked-up C pillar. 
 
However, the similarities end there. While Sway hinted at a possible direction for a compact hatchback, the Nissan Gripz Concept is quite the different proposition. 
 
“Nissan pioneered the idea of the compact crossover, and this is reflected in the enormous popularity of Qashqai and JUKE and the resulting growth of the market segment as other manufacturers play catch-up,”said Shiro Nakamura, senior vice president and chief creative officer, Nissan Motor Company, Ltd.”While the Nissan Gripz Concept is not seen as a direct replacement for either of those two iconic vehicles, it does show the extremes to which the compact crossover can be pushed.” 
 
Created through collaboration between Nissan Design Europe in London and Nissan Global Design Center in Japan, the exterior of the Nissan Gripz Concept is guided by the “emotional geometry” body sculpting concept which depicts strong contrasts through the dynamic, tensional, yet edgy surface. 
 
Dual Personality 
 Taking the high-tech simplicity – two apparent contradictions – of a racing bicycle as inspiration, the concept features a carbon frame over which expressive body panels are placed, like armored cladding. 
 
Exposed carbon elements spear through the design, accentuating features such as the boomerang-shape given to the leading edge of the front door structure. Gripz has four doors – with deep dihedral front doors that swing out and up when opened, and a pair of rear-hinged half-doors behind. There is no B-pillar, allowing easy access to the 2+2 interior. 
 
The front end is dominated by Nissan’s V-motion grille, mounted low and framed by rectangular lamps housing high and low beams. 
 
Embedded in the lamps are forward-facing cameras that record every journey, just as a helmet-cam is used by cyclists. Using a live feed, adventures through great roads can be beamed around the world, allowing for friends to follow the car’s progress on their computer, tablet or smart phone in real time. 
 
Boomerang-shaped running lights sit above the lamps, on top of the front fenders and denote the demarcation line between the matt-black bonnet and the red-orange main body color. 
 
More matte-black can be found on the extended wheel arches, the pinched and indented triangular sill (raised to increase ground clearance) and the A-pillar leading to the floating roof. The roof features a central glazed panel with bullet grey-colored composite panels on either side over the seating areas. 
 
These reduce in width as they flow towards the rear of the car and blend into the rear lamps, which mirror the boomerang shape of the front running lights and wrap themselves around the rear three quarters of the car. 
 
At the rear, a dramatic truncated matte-black Kamm tail gives the concept a “codatronca” effect, while beneath the tailgate sits a pair of chromed trapezoidal exhaust pipes. 
 
Constructed for the concept by Bridgestone, three-spoke, 22-inch wheels are also inspired by racing bicycles – lightweight yet strong, wearing comparatively thin high-pressure tires. Red and white graphics on the sidewalls are replicated on the car’s steering wheel. 
 
While the exterior was created in Europe, a dedicated team based in Japan designed the interior. Like the exterior, functional simplicity is the key to the design. 
 
Again featuring a mix of matte-grey and the deep red-orange colors, the interior underlines the car’s Tour de France inspiration with exposed tubes, molded bucket seats and layered features echoing the cladding effect found on the exterior. 
 
The seats and center console are directly inspired by bicycles, as are the door pulls that are shaped like saddles from a racing bike. The three-spoke steering wheel, meanwhile, replicates the car’s road wheels, right down to the special graphics found on the tire sidewalls. 
 
Like the Nissan Sway Concept and recent production cars, the Nissan Gripz Concept has a “Gliding Wing” instrument panel. This elegantly thin design combines strength with simplicity and perfectly echoes the ethos of the concept. 
 
“What influence this Concept’s design has on the next crossover generation from Nissan remains to be seen, though we are keen to gauge public reaction when it appears at the Frankfurt Show,” said Nakamura.

 . A 620+ Mile Tesla Model S? Here’s Why Elon Musk Seems Preoccupied With Continually Pushing Range Upwards. A decade ago, the idea that an electric car could be made with a range in excess of 200 miles per charge was met with derision by all but the staunchest of engineers and electric vehicle advocates. 
 
Today, Tesla’s all-electric Model S luxury sedan and two-seat Roadster prove that dream is not only plausible but commercially viable too. Thanks to the wonders of Tesla’s proprietary Supercharger rapid charging technology, those who own a high-end Tesla Model S can not only drive more than 200 miles on a single charge but they can recharge their car to drive another 200 miles in under an hour — supercharger network permitting. 
 
Currently, Teslas network of Superchargers are the only way to drive more than 270 miles in a Tesla Model S with ease. (Photo: G.Parrott, via. GCR) 
 
But in an interview with a Danish Television station this week, Tesla Motors [NASDAQ:TSLA] CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla has plans to extend the range of its Model S electric car in the next two or three years, resulting in a car that would easily be capable of traveling around 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) without needing to recharge. 
 
But why? And what purpose does a longer-range Tesla Model S really serve? 
 
The answer is a simple one: ending dependence on fossil fuels. 
 
As  GreenCarReports notes , the current long-distance record for Tesla Model S drivers is well beyond the official 270-mile EPA range of the Tesla Model S 85D or the expected ‘near 300’ mile range of the Tesla Model S 90D. Indeed, last week we told you about one intrepid driver who managed more than 550 miles in his Tesla Model S 85D without recharging. 
 
But at the moment, the only way to extend the range of a Tesla Model S beyond its comfortable everyday range of 270-280 miles is to drive extremely slowly, requiring the kind of driving techniques which we view as both impractical and in some cases, illegal. 
 
The future planned upgrade would allow Model S owners to get the same kind of extraordinary range per charge as today’s hypermiling record-breakers, but while driving their cars completely normally. 
 
At first it might seem like part of Elon Musk’s drive to continually improve Tesla’s vehicles, producing the very best electric car that’s possible. Or it might seem like Tesla feels the need to prove in every way that its cars are equal or superior in performance and range to any gasoline car out there. 
 
Those two reasons may factor in there somewhere — so too does reason the Tesla Model S will likely get a range increase in the coming years is a side effect of improving battery chemistry for the lithium-ion battery cells used in Tesla’s battery packs. But the real reason lies in Tesla’s plan to rid the world of fossil fuels forever. 
 
Longer, faster, better? Is there a reason for Tesla’s continual evolution? 
 
As the energy density of those cells increases — something Musk predicted would happen at a rate of five or ten percent every few years — the theoretical maximum range of the Tesla Model S’ battery pack goes up for a given size. 
 
If those higher-density battery cells are equally expensive to produce as the ones they replace — or perhaps even cheaper than the generation before them thanks to the massive Tesla Gigafactory being built near Reno, NV — the question of expanding the range of the Model S and Tesla’s other electric cars stops becoming one of asking ‘why?’ and starts becoming one of ‘why not?’ 
 
Unlike Nissan, whose own recent improvements in lithium-ion cell technology meant that the 2016 Nissan LEAF can be offered with a 30 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack compared to 24 kilowatt-hours of previous model years, Tesla also knows there’s a great deal of positive publicity to be had for at least offering existing customers the chance to upgrade their car’s battery packs to larger ones for the right price. 
 
Even if only one tenth of one percent of customers actually take Tesla up on the offer, the theoretical ability to upgrade at some point in the future means that Tesla wins the upper hand over other automakers when it comes to public image. 
 
It’s easy to imagine the future conversations between plug-in advocates and car experts going something like this: 
 
Buy a Tesla and you’ll still be able to upgrade it in the future — even if you won’t be able to afford it. Buy another automaker’s electric car, and you’ll be stuck with the same technology forever.  
 
There’s plenty of good reasons for constantly pushing the boundary of range. 
 
Many, including this commentator, would argue that there’s little necessity for an electric vehicle to travel more than 300 miles per charge in the majority of use cases, not only for the inherent safety issues surrounding fatigue after such a long time behind the wheel but also because of the practicalities of lasting 300 miles without a restroom or refreshment break. 
 
But if we examine the other reasons for making an electric car go further on a single charge, such as those rare edge-use cases where the driver genuinely does need to travel 300 miles or more between charges, or is traveling somewhere charging infrastructure is spotty, the case for a longer-range Tesla starts to make sense. 
 
After all, if Tesla’s Elon Musk is really serious about ridding the world of fossil fuels and onto zero-emissions vehicles powered by renewable energy, Tesla needs to prove that an electric car really can do everything a gasoline car can. 
 
And it’s at this point where Tesla’s market strategy, if at first glance a little preoccupied with beating everything else out there, starts to make sense.. 2016 TITAN XD Leads Major Nissan Presence at the State Fair of Texas. World News: 19:18 GMT Thursday 24th September 2015 . [ ] 
    This story   
Nissan  kicked off its biggest presence ever at the world famous       State Fair of Texas with a special showing of the all-new 2016 Nissan       TITAN XD full-size pickup in the heart of American truck country. 

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20150924006277\/en\/ 
 
2016 TITAN XD at the State Fair of Texas (Photo: Business Wire) 
 
The 2016 TITAN XD, which was planned in Tennessee, designed in       California, engineered in Michigan, tested in Arizona and assembled in       Mississippi, will be featured on a specially-built “TITAN Proving       Grounds” display, providing truck fans the unique opportunity to take       part in a series of interactive activities and experience TITAN XD in       its natural setting. The State Fair of Texas runs September 25 through       October 18 at Fair Park in Dallas. 
 
“Texas has played a huge role in the development of our all-new lineup       of American TITAN trucks. The initial focus groups took place here and       we’ve taken it through multiple clinics throughout the state. Texans       know trucks and we wanted to hear from expert truck customers,” said       Fred Diaz, senior vice president, Sales & Marketing and Operations,       U.S.A., Nissan North America, Inc. “To test TITAN XD under real world       conditions, we’ve also put prototype trucks in the hands of folks in       Texas and across the U.S. - construction workers, farmers, ranchers, and       even a rodeo equipment manufacturer.” 
 
The centerpiece of Nissan’s State Fair of Texas display is the TITAN XD,       which is powered by a new Cummins ® 5.0L V8 Turbo Diesel       engine rated at a powerful 555 lb-ft of torque and is set to go on sale       at Nissan dealers nationwide in December. 
 
The TITAN XD – which features a maximum towing capacity of more than       12,000 pounds* when properly equipped – will later be available in a       total of three cab configurations, three bed lengths, two frame sizes,       4x4 and 4x2 drive and five grade levels. 
 
“The key attributes of TITAN XD is that it offers increased towing       stability, along with more torque, than a traditional half-ton pickup –       without the sacrifices of a harsh ride, unnecessary capability and       higher price of a ¾-ton truck,” said Diaz. 
 
TITAN’s innovation leadership continues with cutting-edge available       towing, utility features and driving aids, including an Integrated       Trailer Brake Controller, Trailer Sway Control (TSC), Tow\/Haul Mode with       Downhill Speed Control and a Trailer Light Check system that allows       one-person hook-up operation – including checking turn signals, brake       lights and running\/clearance lights. 
 
Also assisting trailer hook-ups is the TITAN’s RearView Monitor with       Trailer Guides, while the available Around View ® Monitor       (AVM) provides a virtual 360° “bird’s eye” view of the surrounding area       from front, rear and side cameras to help with parking and pulling in       and out of tight spaces. The system also includes Moving Object       Detection (MOD), which helps detect moving objects such as vehicles,       shopping carts or other large objects near the vehicle when backing out       via an on-screen notification and warning chime. 
 
Helping TITAN XD owners take advantage of its ample towing power are two       available hitches – including an integrated gooseneck hitch engineered       into the frame and easily accessible in the bed. 
 
Nissan currently employs more than 1,000 people in Texas at the Nissan       Motor Acceptance Corporation (NMAC), Nissan Central Region and a parts       distribution center. There are also 71 Nissan dealerships in the state.

“Altima has experienced five consecutive years of sales growth, the only vehicle in the mid-size sedan segment to do so, with sales growing more than 60 percent since the start of the economic recovery in 2009,” said Ghosn. “With this new, redesigned 2016 Altima, we expect to be more competitive in the marketplace.” 

					 
Nissan performance in the United States is on a record pace in 2015, with sales passing the one million mark earlier than any time in company history. Nissan Group sales are up 4.2 percent through August. The growth has been fueled in part by a 37 percent increase in Nissan Rogue sales and a 30 percent increase in sales of the all-new Nissan Murano. 

					 
Altima, Nissan’s best-selling vehicle in North America, has been redesigned for the 2016 model year, including new exterior and interior styling, enhanced technology and connectivity, a new Altima SR sports model and new safety features such as segment-exclusive* Predictive Forward Collision Warning (PFCW). In addition, highway fuel economy has been increased to a best-in-class** 39 miles-per-gallon for Altima 2.5-liter engine models (except 2.5 SR). 

					 
With the addition of the new SR model, the 2016 Altima is available in a choice of seven models – 2.5, 2.5 S, 2.5 SR, 2.5 SV, 2.5 SL, 3.5 SR and 3.5 SL. The five 2.5-liter models feature a 182-horsepower 2.5-liter DOHC inline 4-cylinder engine, while 3.5-liter Altimas offer a 270-horsepower 3.5-liter DOHC V6. 

					 
The new 2016 Nissan Altima is scheduled to go on sale in November. Full information on the vehicle will be released later today by executive vice president, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and Nissan North America chairman José Muñoz at a meeting of the Automotive Press Association in Detroit.

Source: Nissan North America. Support for nearly 1,200 Canadian students coast-to-coast begins as Nissan Kickoff Project enters second year. MISSISSAUGA, ON, Sept. 14, 2015 \/CNW\/ - Starting with four schools in Edmonton last week, the Nissan Kickoff Project (formerly called Back in the Game), in partnership with the Canadian Football League (CFL), has returned for its second year to give more Canadian youth the opportunity to experience the educational, developmental and social benefits that organized football provides. This year, nearly 1,200 students from 26 schools in 19 cities and eight provinces will receive the specific support they need to play football, including financial funding, equipment, uniforms and motivational events. 

""The Nissan Kickoff Project is about giving Canada's next generation the opportunity to play and grow on a team,"" said Christian Meunier, President, Nissan Canada. ""This year, we're going to reach more Canadian schools and our staff and dealers, as well as the CFL and many of its teams, are ready and excited to build on the impact we saw last year. Together, we're hoping to once again make a real difference in communities coast-to-coast."" 

Working with various sources, the Nissan Kickoff Project identifies schools that have the passion for the game but are in need of resources that the program can provide. Schools are then chosen in areas where Nissan dealers and, where possible, the CFL and its teams are able to take part at the crucial local level. Beginning with Queen Elizabeth High, W.P. Wagner, J. Percy Page and Oscar Romero high schools in Edmonton last week, teams from 22 other schools will be surprised with a variety of support throughout September and October as the football season kicks into high gear.

""We know how important it is for kids to feel like they belong to something, and the Nissan Kickoff Project has just given our team and students something that they will never forget,"" said Nick Dagg, Head Coach, Oscar Romero. ""The equipment and funds are fantastic, but I think the greatest value was seeing how special and important Nissan Canada made our kids feel – that's a feeling they will keep with them forever.""

For the students involved, winning on the field represents the immediate goal but, for coaches, parents and administrators, it is not how a successful season is defined. Teamwork, cooperation, hard work and friendship are just some of the things that communities will see these students benefit from and, as a long-time partner with Nissan Canada, the CFL is proud to take part in the initiative. From player appearances to donations of training equipment and coaching assistance, the CFL, B.C. Lions, Edmonton Eskimos, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts will all be pitching in to help train and motivate the next generation of Canadian football players.

""We are immensely proud to be teamed up with Nissan once again to bring more football to schools across Canada,"" said Jeffrey L. Orridge, Commissioner of the Canadian Football League. ""The Nissan Kickoff Project is a testament to Nissan's commitment to building stronger communities and football's ability to build stronger and healthier young people who embrace team work, discipline and dedication — and have tremendous fun along the way.""

The journey can be followed at #NissanKickoffProject on social media platforms and, to share the program's deep impact, Director\/Producer David Grabias of Artifact Films will be creating a documentary about the trials, tribulations and achievements of one of this year's schools, the details of which will be announced at a later date.

SOURCE Nissan Canada Inc.. The 2016 Nissan Leaf touts 107-mile range thanks to a larger battery. If you’re looking to get over 100 miles out of your next EV before needing to recharge, Nissan hopes its retooled Leaf will grab your attention. Two of the 2016 models claim an EPA-estimated 107-mile range thanks to a bigger 30 kWh battery. And yes, that’s both best-in-class and 27 percent further than the previous power pack would take you. Looking to park one in your driveway? The base S model is priced at $29,010 before a $7,500 federal tax credit lowers the cost to $21,510. There are also SV and SL models, priced at $26,700 and $29,290 (after tax credit) respectively, if you’re after a new ride with more options than the standard model offers.

If you want the larger battery and longer range, you’ll have to splurge for an SV or SL as the S option still packs the same 24 kWh battery as before. Those other added options for the pricier two models include NissanConnect EV that sorts remote connection, monitors battery charge, turns on the heat\/air conditioning before you get inside and more. No matter which one you pick, all three pack in a 80kW AC synchronous motor with 107 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque. All of which zooms you around town without creating emissions, of course.. Frankfurt Auto Show Is a Hotbed of High-Tech and Advanced Fuel Models. FRANKFURT ( TheStreet ) -- Advanced automotive technology in models such as the new Opel Astra and the battery-powered Porsche Mission E dominated the attention and created the buzz at the 66 th Frankfurt Auto Show in Germany's financial capital. 
 
The talk in Frankfurt centered on autonomous cars and how quickly they might be available in widespread use, as well as the future of alternative-fuel vehicles and the government regulations that dictate their replacement of vehicles powered by fossil fuels. 
 
The introductions and displays arrived on a wave of optimism and cheer because of rising sales in Europe after several years of stagnation due to the global financial crisis. Sales on the continent rose 8.6% for the first eight months of 2015. 
 
Volkswagen , which owns Porsche, showed the electric Mission E as a prototype, though VW executives hinted that the automaker intends to build the vehicle within a few years. With a range claimed to be 300 miles between charges and zero-to-60 acceleration of less than 4 seconds, Mission E represents another potential threat in the luxury segment to Tesla's battery-powered Model S sedan. 
 
VW earlier announced a battery-powered Audi eTron , another battery-powered luxury vehicle that likely will compete with Tesla for well-heeled customers. 
 
VW, Tesla and many global automakers are scrambling to develop advanced batteries for customers in all price ranges that can help them comply with tightening restrictions on emissions and use of fossil fuel. The industry also is looking toward a day when consumers will be able to buy cars that safely take over some -- and eventually, all -- driving functions. 
 
One of the top selling points of General Motors'  Opel Astra wagon is its extremely efficient rating of 90 grams of CO2 emitted per kilometer. 
 
""We call this a quantum leap,"" said Tina Muller, Opel's chief marketing officer, who has been in charge of sprucing up the image of GM's German subsidiary. The model will come with advanced LED matrix lighting, a first in its class; new engines; and Opel OnStar, the first time GM has introduced its connectivity and personal service system in Europe. 
 
Daimler , the maker of Mercedes-Benz, showed a sporty coupe version of its C Class luxury automobile, as well as a convertible S-Class top-of-the line model. 
 
Daimler and the Renault Nissan Alliance of the French and Japanese automakers, Renault  and Nissan  , held a joint press conference to flesh out the deepening relationship among the three companies . Daimler's chief executive officer, Dieter Zetsche, and Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault and Nissan, are described as collegial collaborators, as well as competitors. 
 
Since Daimler's joining of the alliance was announced six years ago, the number of joint projects has more than quadrupled, the companies said. They include a factory in Aguascalientes, Mexico, that will build Infiniti compact luxury sedans for Nissan and a Mercedes-Benz luxury sedan. Battery-powered versions of Daimler's Smart city cars will be powered by Renault electric motors. 
    next   last ». CA Climate-Change Bill Passed, Electric Utilities.... On Friday, September 11, the California Senate approved SB 350, the Clean Energy and Reduction Act--by far the most far-reaching climate change legislation enacted in the U.S. 

The bill's provisions codify Governor Jerry Brown's goals of generating half the energy used in the state from renewable sources by 2030, and doubling the energy efficiency of buildings during the same period. 

DON'T MISS: CA Assembly Approves Aggressive New Plans To Combat Climate Change (Jun 2014) 

That's the good news. 

The bad news is that a third goal, reducing petroleum use in vehicles by up to 50 percent, is no longer part of the legislation after amendments made last week in the Assembly. 

It was removed after intensive and high-dollar lobbying by the oil industry--focused on the message that jobs would be lost, gas prices would soar, and California's economy would become unviable if climate-change legislation were enacted. 

Media coverage focused a great deal on the oil industry's success at quashing the petroleum-reduction goal, with angry reactions from a variety of groups. 

But it turns out there's some offsetting good news for that one, too. 

In a day-after post on the NRDC Switchboard blog, Max Baumhefner of the Natural Resources Defense Council writes that amidst all the sturm und drang of high-dollar oil lobbying, the revised third part of SB 350 has been largely overlooked. 

ALSO SEE: Cross-Border Carbon: Mexico Sets Limit On Climate-Change Emissions 

News coverage of the bill's passage ""focused on the oil companies' unsightly lobbying to remove a petroleum reduction goal from the bill,"" he writes. 

But ""few have noticed the provisions of Senator Kevin de León's legislation that make replacing oil as the dominant transportation fuel a core mission of the electric industry."" 

That goal allows ""Californians to 'fill up' at home on cleaner electricity that's the cost equivalent of dollar-a-gallon gas."" 

The key is that ""Senator de León's bill also establishes that a 'principal goal' of electric utility 'resource planning and investment' is 'to improve the environment and to encourage the diversity of energy resources through improvements in energy efficiency, development of renewable energy resources, and widespread transportation electrification."" 

And widespread deployment of electric vehicles is expected to help with grid stabilization, making it less expensive for utilities to meet the goal of 50 percent renewable electricity in just 15 years. 

MORE: Nissan CEO Ghosn: Climate Change Must Be Corporate Humanitarian Cause 

It will also significantly cut the cost of commuting for Californians--that equivalent of dollar-a-gallon gasoline--giving them more money to spend on other things. 

So while the 50-percent petroleum reduction goal is not part of the law, the goal of electrifying California's transportation is now official policy. 

That basically sounds like an invitation to California's electric utilities to eat the oil industry's lunch. 

Win one, lose one?

Follow GreenCarReports on. Nissan to preview upcoming Z car with new crossover concept. http:\/\/ift.tt\/1PWFxUY


  Nissan's official teaser image shows off the car's styling


Radical next-gen Zed to be previewed by baby SUV concept at Frankfurt - and it's due on sale by 2017

Nissan has released the first official preview image of its new crossover concept, which will be unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show later this month.
The new crossover will bring back the famous Z badge - and the new model is poised to hit showrooms within the next 18 months.
The Japanese brand has been weighing up a variety of options on where to take the famous Z brand as the current 370Z is phased out by 2017. It has considered a higher-powered sports car and a cheaper, more basic four-cylinder model - as previewed by the iDx compact coupé concepts that were revealed at the Tokyo motor show in 2013.
However, sources indicate that Nissan has settled on a more radical solution: making the next Z car a small sports crossover.
Blog - Is a Z crossover a wise move for Nissan?
An SUV-influenced Z car is likely to infuriate purists, but Nissan believes it can still satisfy a large number of Z fans while also tapping into a huge new customer base, particularly in the US, where the badge has equity and the crossover market far outweighs the sector for small sports cars.
Senior Nissan officials have recently hinted at a rethink on the Z strategy. Earlier this summer, the firm’s chief creative officer, Shiro Nakamura, told Australian media: “I don’t think the  next one [Z car] is going to be the 390Z. It’s not growing because it’s already big enough. You know, 350 started with 240, 300, 350 and then came 370. I don’t think we should go higher.
“We haven’t yet decided anything about whether next-generation Z should be anything larger or with more power,” he said.
In a clear reference to a switch of vehicle type, Nakamura added: “We  need to take another path. I feel Z needs more revolution than evolution. I think  GT-R has to stay the most high-performance symbol  of Nissan technology and Z  is a more affordable sports car or a sporty car to get the younger people.”
Nissan executive vice-president Trevor Mann has supported Nakamura’s view. He told Autocar: “We do  know that Z, as a sub-brand  if you like, has high equity.  The market is not like it  used to be, though, so I  think that if you do something, you’ll need to do something which is quite special, to attract the segment.”
When asked to comment directly on Nakamura’s statement, Mann said: “If that’s what Nakamura said, then I guess he might be right, in terms of re-establishing the links to something people can connect to.”
That’s likely to be a reference to price. It’s thought the new Z crossover will be notably cheaper than a £30k 370Z and its range-toppers could overlap with the lower-end editions of the Qashqai.
The new Z will be similar in size to the Nissan Juke although, unlike the current version of that car, the new model will be based on the Renault-Nissan Alliance’s latest CMF B platform. Its engine line-up will be able to include the full range of 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engines.
It’s unclear if the new model will be a coupé-esque three-door or if Nissan will include a pair of rear doors with hidden handles. It’s likely that the roofline will compromise rear cabin space for adults, though, making the Z crossover a car with occasional rear seats at best. The more extreme concept, which will be designed to gauge reaction after the Frankfurt show, may even be a two-seater only.
The new platform has the flexibility to accommodate hybrid powertrains, so it’s possible the concept at least will showcase a set-up featuring an electric motor to drive one of the axles.
Nissan is likely to argue that the GT-R has managed to mix strong performance credentials with a rear-biased four-wheel drive system and that a hybrid crossover can provide some of the same character - while potentially also offering zero-emissions running for short distances.
The Z should allow Nissan to compete in the lucrative middle ground on small crossovers, attracting buyers who don’t want as large a car as the Qashqai but who find the Juke too quirky nor not sporty enough.
The demographics of Juke buyers are said to have confounded Nissan product planners. The average age of Juke buyers is in the late 40s, but this is based on really young purchasers and a surprisingly large band of elderly customers.
A Z-badged crossover would also be a legitimate choice of vehicle for the Nismo tuning division. Nissan hopes to extend the sub-brand’s influence with cars like the forthcoming Pulsar Nismo, but senior figures insist it will not be applied to models that don’t allow it to deliver genuine performance credentials.It’s thought the continued strength of Juke sales has allowed Nissan to consider adding a further small crossover to its line-up.
The Juke is expected to evolve for its next incarnation, which will bring a switch to the same CMF B platform as the new Z crossover (and the next Micra) but only mild changes to its exterior styling.
“We think the Juke still looks a really fresh car,” Mann said. “Sales are still really strong and the customer base continues to expand for that type of vehicle. I think that’ll be reflected in what comes next for Juke.”
Z cars - the six pack the crossover must follow
240Z (1969) - The original Z was first shown at the 1969 Frankfurt show and went on sale the same year. It started with a 149bhp 2.4-litre six-cylinder engine in the US. This was upgraded to a 2.6 in 1974 and a 2.8 in 1975, resulting in name changes to 260Z and 280Z.
280ZX (1978) - The second-generation Z car carried over the 2.8-litre engine and five-speed manual gearbox of the first generation but little else. It added more luxury and was larger. A turbo boosted power and performance in 1981, taking the output up to 178bhp.
300ZX (1983) - The second-generation Z car carried over the 2.8-litre engine and five-speed manual gearbox of the first generation but little else. It added more luxury and was larger. A turbo boosted power and performance in 1981, taking the output up to 178bhp.
300ZX (1990) - The engine remained largely the same for the fourth-generation Z car, but it now had 219bhp in naturally aspirated form and 296bhp in turbo guise, bringing a 0-60mph time as low as 5.0sec. This version also introduced the first Z convertible, in 1993.
350Z (2002) - The Z car was absent for five years after the 300ZX went off sale in 1997. It returned with the 350Z, the first Z model built after the creation of the Renault-Nissan alliance. It came with a 3.5-litre V6 engine.
370Z (2009) - The coupé version of the 370Z went on sale in early 2009, with the convertible following towards the end of the same year. It came with a 3.7-litre V6. Power outputs have ranged up to 339bhp for the latest Nismo edition.

Vía Autocar RSS Feed http:\/\/ift.tt\/1EMR7RU","Nissan leads a universe in zero-emission mobility, dominated by sales of a LEAF, a initial mass-market, pure-electric car and a best-selling EV in history.
Tesla has continued growing volume, despite cheap fuel, by delivering a mix of performance, luxury features and range that is expected to approach 300 miles per charge with the addition of a new P90d version of the Model S battery sedan.
Rich subsidies for emissions-free vehicles are straining the finances of a municipal tunnel that collects no fees from an island’s growing population of battery-powered Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S cars..
NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Nissan  , in an attempt to stimulate consumer interest in its Leaf electric sedan, will offer a version for 2016 with a more powerful battery that extends the car's maximum range between charges by 27%.
by Antuan Goodwin @antgoo September 10, 2015 11:46 AM PDT Updated: September 10, 2015 1:18 PM PDT Not much has changed externally for the 2016 Nissan Leaf -- the Leaf is now entering its fifth year of production -- but the automaker announced September 10 that the electric car will be getting a new, larger battery option and a step up to what it claims is best-in-class range."
7,porsche,"Porsche may pick production chief Oliver Blume as CEO this week: Sources. BERLIN\/HAMBURG: The supervisory board of Volkswagen's Porsche business may name the sports-car maker's production chief Oliver Blume as the division's new chief executive this week, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. 

Blume, a former manager at VW's luxury division Audi who has overseen production at Porsche since 2013, will replace Matthias Mueller, who has taken the helm at Volkswagen, the sources said. 

Porsche declined to comment. 

The Stuttgart-based division is grappling with the loss of several executives since VW was rocked by the admission that it cheated US vehicle emissions tests. 

Mueller replaced Martin Winterkorn, who resigned as CEO of Europe's largest automaker last Wednesday amid VW's biggest business-related scandal in its 78-year-history. 

The departure of Mueller, who ran Porsche for almost five years, came a day after personnel chief Thomas Edig quit Porsche to join VW's commercial-vehicles division. 

Porsche's development chief Wolfgang Hatz has been suspended by VW's supervisory board, together with his counterparts at Audi and the VW brand, sources told Reuters earlier on Monday..

September 15, 2015 - 1:34 pm ET FRANKFURT -- Rolls-Royce Motor Cars may develop an electric vehicle as tighter regulation on auto emissions pushes even the most elite auto manufacturers to look into battery- powered cars.""Suppose we find a battery technology that can offer ranges that are acceptable to our customers,"" Torsten Muller-Otvos, head of the BMW AG unit, said in an interview at the Frankfurt International Auto Show.

LONDON Shares slid on Tuesday, with Europe led lower by mining companies as copper prices fell on worries over Chinese demand, while the dollar rose to its highest in almost two weeks after Federal Reserve officials signaled U.S. interest rates might rise this year. 

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index fell 2.6 percent, reversing a trend that had seen stocks rise in Asia. Wall Street was expected to open lower, according to index futures. 

An index of Europe-listed mining shares dropped 5.6 percent after copper retreated 2.5 percent. 

Worries over a slowdown in the Chinese economy have weighed on markets in recent weeks, and preliminary factory activity data for September will be a focus for investors on Wednesday. 

""If China manufacturing numbers come in better than expected tomorrow, we could see a rebound in mining stocks for some days, but the sector's medium-term outlook remains bearish,"" Christian Stocker, equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich. 

A further fall in shares of German carmaker Volkswagen, which has admitted cheating on vehicle emission tests, also took a toll on the FTSEurofirst, as an investigation of the cheating spread to Asia. VW shares were last down 19 percent. Porsche, part of the VW group, lost 17 percent. 

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gave up earlier gains and was last down 0.3 percent. 
 
Chinese shares rose, with the Shanghai Composite and the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen both closing up about 0.9 percent. 

Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. 

Weakness in stock markets helped lift the yen against the dollar, though the divergence between the Fed on the one hand and the ECB and Bank of Japan on the other helped push the dollar to its highest since Sept. 10 against a basket of currencies. 
 
The U.S. Federal Reserve held policy steady last week, citing risks to global growth. But Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday he still expected rates to rise this year and St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard said there was a chance of a hike next month. 

By contrast, European Central Bank officials have been stressing monetary policy in the euro zone will remain loose for some time. Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday ECB rates would stay low as long as growth did. 

The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.1155, having hit a high of $1.1459 on Friday. The dollar eased 0.5 percent to 119.96 yen per dollar but was still above Friday lows. 

Expectations of a prolonged period of low ECB rates, and the fall in stocks, pushed down yields on low-risk euro zone debt. German 10-year Bund yields hit a one-month low at 0.62 percent, down 6 basis points on the day. 
 
The ECB launched a trillion-euro bond buying program in March, but has failed to raise the market's long-term inflation expectations. 

""I'm not too convinced that they are signaling they are ready to do something in October, but it does support our view that if nothing changes between now and December, the ECB may have to add more stimulus,"" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank. 

Oil prices fell as concern over global growth weakened the outlook for demand and as traders took profits from a rise of 3 to 4 percent on Monday. 

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 79 cents a barrel at $48.13. Gold eased with stocks and commodities. It last traded at $1,128.40 an ounce.

By Andreas Cremer

WOLFSBURG, Germany, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (LSE: 0P6N.L - news) knows it will take much more than just new leadership and a corporate overhaul to clear the air after it was caught cheating in U.S. diesel emissions tests.

Beyond the measures announced by the German carmaker on Friday, VW executives, customers, investors and workers alike are struggling to divine what lies ahead.

The new chief executive, 62-year-old Matthias Mueller, until now head of the Porsche sports-car division, faces a host of problems that had already been looming before the diesel scandal broke and may now be worsened by its repercussions.

Not least among these is falling profitability at the VW brand, but the immediate priority will be to clean up the mess in the United States, whose potential impact on the company has been compared to the 2010 BP oil spill.

First (Other OTC: FSTC - news) may come a sustained show of contrition in a U.S. advertising campaign, said one VW manager, who asked not to be identified.

""Humility will be the name of the game,"" he said.

Following the crisis-management path taken by General Motors (NYSE: GM - news) and News Corp (Other OTC: NWSAL - news) , VW has tapped a U.S. law firm to lead a thorough investigation.

It (Other OTC: ITGL - news) promises to be a long and rough ride.

VW faces dozens of public and private lawsuits, government investigations, compensation and recall expenses, the combined cost of which could exceed the 6.5 billion euros ($7.28 billion) it has put aside.

The company's market value has plunged by 23 billion euros, or 30 percent, in the week since U.S. authorities revealed that it had used a ""defeat device"" to mask illegal levels of nitrogen oxide pollution from diesel engines.

Dealing with the fallout in the United States must override all other considerations, said a European fund manager who is among Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news) 's 20 biggest shareholders.

""Then we need to talk about strategic direction,"" the fund manager said, adding that VW could review its commitment to diesel because of a likely consumer and regulatory backlash. ""This scandal has given them an opportunity to consider where they should go with their portfolio of models.""

Mueller should go further and abandon U.S. diesel vehicles altogether, said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton, recommending that the company funnel cash into plug-in hybrids and other low-emissions technology instead.

""VW needs to think big and bold,"" he said.

Another big challenge for Mueller will be navigating a sharp downturn in China, where VW's bumper earnings have until recently more than offset its underperformance in Europe.

Many insiders are calling for a change of corporate culture. VW's centralisation under Winterkorn and Ferdinand Piech - ousted as chairman in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news) - was ill-suited to a 12-brand empire with 119 plants in 31 countries.

The ""climate of fear"" may have been a factor in the test-rigging, said one company official, just as it was two years earlier when Chinese customer complaints about defective gearboxes were suppressed for months.

""We need to create an atmosphere in which problems can be communicated openly to superiors rather than concealed,"" labour chief Berndt Osterloh told staff on Thursday.

A LOT OF PHONE CALLS

The emissions trickery and its consequences are also spreading beyond North America. Germany's transport ministry said VW had also manipulated tests in Europe, with 2.8 million vehicles affected in Germany.

Worst hit in reputational terms will be the VW brand itself, already struggling to find 5 billion euros in savings and lift profitability that has slumped below rivals such as Renault (Swiss: RNO.SW - news) and PSA Peugeot Citroen.

Under new boss Herbert Diess, the division had promised the first 1 billion euros in cuts this year, a goal reiterated three days before the diesel cheating emerged, in an investor presentation entitled ""Stability in Volatile Times"".

Volkswagen's humiliation could weaken its European prices, further eroding the core brand's narrow margins and requiring still bigger cuts from unions.

""The (U.S.) disclosures may impact negatively on VW's ability to maintain its global premium pricing power,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Harald Hendrikse said in a note this week.

To limit the damage, dealers are already urging VW to improve its communication with baffled customers. Sales staff said they were ""getting a lot of phone calls"" from clients but silence from Wolfsburg headquarters.

One dealer in Cologne said he was eager to recall some 2,000 vehicles for the illegal engine software to be neutralised, generating 1.5 million euros in servicing revenue as well as opportunities to repair customer relationships - or even sell some more cars.

""It's a tough market and we don't mind the extra business,"" he said, ""as terrible as it is for the brand.""

But any silver linings look paper-thin to VW's 593,000 employees around the world - almost half of whom are in Germany.

A groundsman articulated their bemusement as he mowed the lawn in Wolfsburg on Friday morning. ""I just don't understand why VW did this,"" he said.

TechArt Porsche Cayenne 700 Hp
by Ritesh Madhokon September 24, 2015No Comments       
Just imagine Turbo’s 0-100 kmph in 4.5 seconds and a massive top speed of 279 kmph with a power of 520 Hp. Now add a power boost of 180 Hp along with an increase in torque of 170 Nm and thinks how far it would push the car’s limits. TechArt has quite recently blessed Porsche Cayenne with a power kit that makes it possible for the car to cruise at a top speed of 308 kmph while decreasing its 0-100 kmph acceleration time to just 3.9 seconds. And, just so you know, this TA058\/T2 power kit makes Porsche Cayenne just as good as the Bentley Bentayga.
Power is delivered in two stages with a normal operation being the first stage and Sports being the second stage. Porsche Cayenne will give you a power of upto 640 Hp in the normal operation mode and just with the push of a Sport button you can feel the blast of 700 Hp roaring into the car.
Porsche Cayenne with its power kit can now reach 0-160 kmph in 9.1 seconds along with its ability to push from 0 to 200 kmph in just a matter of 13.8 seconds. This is all very impressive and the power kit will show its true potential when you’re racing somebody on the drag strip.
2015 Proche Cayenne Turbo – Base model
The unfortunate questions of increased fuel consumption and higher levels of CO2 emissions come running towards TechArt right after its announcement of the power kit. In its defense TechArt claims that even after such a massive increase in power and torque, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have gone up only moderately. The fuel economy is affected only by 1 percent increase from its previous mileage figures. The CO2 emissions have also seen an elevation of 0.8% only. Seeing these statistics, it is safe to say that these issues have been dealt with by TechArt quite efficiently as the increase in these levels is quite literally, moderate. With Porsche Cayenne matching up to the standards of Bentley Bantayga, the power kit is much awaited before its availability somewhere later this year.

Porsche chief takes wheel at Volkswagen. FRANKFURT - Matthias Mueller, head of luxury sports car maker Porsche now taking the steering wheel at scandal-hit Volkswagen, is a man described as ""The Imperturbable."" 
 
That quality might serve the 62-year-old well as he takes charge of the carmaker now mired in its deepest crisis ever over a massive emissions test scam. 
 
""We will overcome this crisis,"" vowed the white-haired and blue-eyed manager, a trained tool maker and IT expert, pledging to ""restore confidence... through an unsparing investigation and maximum transparency."" 
 
Mueller, born in the former communist East Germany, had already been tipped to take over VW during a bitter leadership struggle earlier this year between outgoing CEO Martin Winterkorn and his one-time mentor and former supervisory board chief Ferdinand Piech. 
 
It was Winterkorn who eventually won that battle, only to fall this week over the pollution cheating revelations, the biggest scandal ever to hit VW. 
 
The careers of Mueller and Winterkorn are closely interlinked. 
 
They already worked together at VW's top-line brand, Audi, in Ingolstadt in Bavaria, where Mueller began his career; Winterkorn was appointed chief in 2002. 
 
At roughly the same time Winterkorn was appointed CEO of the entire VW group in 2007, meantime, Mueller went to Wolfsburg, too, where he took charge of the projects department. He was subsequently made a general representative of the group. 
 
Born on June 9, 1953, in Limbach-Oberfrohna in what is now the eastern part of reunited Germany, Mueller fled communism to the neighbouring West German regional state of Bavaria with his parents. 
 
He has told the daily Die Welt that he originally wanted to become a professional football player. 
 
He is still a keen soccer fan and supporter of FC Bayern and Stuttgarter Kickers, according to the mass-circulation daily Bild. 
 
But in the end, Mueller trained as a tool maker at Audi and went on to study information technology in Munich. 
 
According to Die Welt, Mueller is a man ""who loves cars and who loves people who love cars."" 
 
His first car was a VW Beetle and he now owns an Audi TT and Porsche 911, according to Bild. He also occasionally likes to go for a jaunt in the legendary Porsche 550 Spyder sports car that he borrows from Porsche's own museum. 
 
Die Welt dubbed him ""The Imperturbable,"" saying he was someone who knows how to use his elbows. 
 
""But I don't see it as playing foul, rather as a sign of perseverance and mettle,"" the newspaper quoted Mueller as saying. 
 
Uwe Hueck, head of Porsche's works committee, said Mueller ""has the whiff of Porsche about him. His engine is seated lower and he has wide tyres."" 
 
Mueller -- who tends to lapse into a strong Bavarian dialect when not on duty -- was appointed CEO at Porsche in 2010, not long after VW had emerged victorious in its tortuous takeover battle with Porsche. 
 
As far back as 2005, Porsche hatched an audacious plan to take control of VW, which was 15 times larger than Porsche. 
 
But the plan ran out of steam a result of the financial crisis and failed to win enough support from VW's shareholders. This led to VW turning the tables on Porsche and taking over the sports car maker. 
 
As Porsche CEO, Mueller also sits on Volkswagen's management board. 
 
In March this year, he was able to present record annual sales, turnover and profit for the sports car maker. 
 
""Porsche has come along very successfully and is now in better shape than ever before,"" he beamed. 
 
In a recent interview with the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Mueller noted the difference in the corporate cultures of both companies. 
 
Porsche was ""almost like a family company with 20,000 employees,"" while VW in Wolfsburg ""was in charge of 600,000 people around the world,"" he said. 
 
Different management styles were therefore needed. 
 
""Just because something works here with us in Stuttgart, that doesn't mean to say it will function in Wolfsburg,"" Mueller said. 
 
He saw himself as an ""approachable team-player,"" who tried ""to push through his decisions in a collegial and harmonious way."" 
 
But Mueller added that he could also be ""pretty forceful. I don't like it when things are talked to death."" 
 
In the public debate about the massive influx of refugees into Germany, Mueller takes a very clear stance. 
 
""We have to oppose and stand up to extremism,"" he told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 
 
""People from 56 different countries work at Porsche. I don't think I need to say any more."" 
 
It was high time that ""industry bosses made their opinions known about certain issues,"" he said. 
 
Now that Mueller has taken over from Winterkorn at the helm of VW, one of Germany's biggest companies, his words are likely to carry even more clout. 

	  
 
- AFP. Porsche 991 Vs Porsche 991.2. News photos (3) Videos Posted on 09.9.2015 08:00 by Ciprian Florea +   It’s been four years since its introduction at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show , and the 2012 Porsche 911 (991) has just received it mid-cycle facelift. Much like all 911 facelifts from 1990 onward, this update brings small, evolutionary changes to the sports car’s appearance, and new convenience features and tech on the inside. However, the 991.2, as Porsche officially calls this facelift, is a whole different car under the hood, which isn’t exactly ordinary considering Stuttgart’s take on previous mid-cycle updates.
And I’m not talking about increased outputs or different displacements for the engines. Nope, this time around Porsche stripped the 911 Carrera of of its naturally aspirated units and planted a turbocharged mill between the rear wheels — a change that’s almost as big as going from air-cooling to water-cooling, which happened in 1998 and caused quite a commotion among 911 purists. But most of us got over it.
The new switch is already a subject of controversy, with fanatics sobbing over the death of the all-motor Carrera, and turbo fans cheering over having the option to purchase force-fed 911s without having to pay those expensive stickers that come with the Turbo and the Turbo S .
Because the 991.2 is such a big deal compared to its predecessor, I decided to have a closer look at what sets the two versions of 991-generation 911 apart.
Continue reading for the full story.
continue reading Exterior
As with most 911 facelifts, the 991.2 is mostly about the little details. Though the current 911 was far from dated in terms of design (what 911 is anyway?), a mild refresh was performed to keep the sports car in line with today’s trends. You know, anything older than three or four years is... well... old in the current market, but a few nips and tucks will magically turn it into a fresh product.
All told, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and in the wallets of those who can afford a new 911...
Irony aside, upon close inspection, the 991.2’s exterior has quite a few new details.
Up front, the most notable change lies in the bumper. Though the three-piece intake configuration was carried over from the previous model, the actual openings are different in shape and size. The main intakes extend farther toward the sides and feature three horizontal slats instead of two. Also, the LED light strips above are significantly slimmer and completely integrated into the frame surrounding the openings.
The center piece seems to be about the same size, but it now features two horizontal slats instead of one and the trapezoidal shape defining it has been turned upside down. Down below, there’s a slightly larger splitter, which in conjunction with the Cayman GT4-like bumper, makes the new 911 seem a bit more aggressive. The headlamps have also been revised, now featuring four-point daytime running lights.
For my part, I like the previous bumper better. Then again, I think the 964 is the best looking 911 ever, which I guess makes me an old fart when it comes to styling. All told, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and in the wallets of those who can afford a new 911...Exterior Dimensions
Porsche 991 Porsche 991.2Height51.30 Inches50.9 InchesWidth71.18 Inches71.2 InchesWheelbase96.46 Inches96.5 InchesLength176.81 Inches177.1 InchesSide-by-side comparison
Around back, we can identify two important changes. First up is the engine lid’s grille, which ditched the previous design with horizontal louvers for a new configuration with vertical ones. The revised grille adds a touch of 1963-1964 Porsche 911 (901) to the 991, as it is very similar to the original 911’s rear deck lid. To me, this is the 992.1’s coolest feature in the exterior design. Second, the bumper received extra air outlets on each side, a feature borrowed from the Turbo models. Although they’re smaller than on the Turbo, they do play an important part in cooling the new turbocharged engine. Other details that set the 991.2 apart from the outgoing model are the longer lights in the bumper and the slightly reshaped taillights, now looking a bit sleeker and featuring small dents toward the rear deck. They also include four-point brake lights.
When viewed from the side, the 991.2 can easily be mistaken for a 991. That’s because the updated car only received door handles without recess covers and revised five-spoke wheels. The car does sit 0.4 inch lower, but that’s not exactly noticeable. Same goes for the half-inch wider rear rims.
Speaking of dimensions, the 991.2 is actually longer and wider than its predecessor, but it’s not like you’re going to notice it given we’re talking about less than two tenths of an inch for both numbers. It’s the height that’s more significant, as Porsche lowered it by nearly half an inch.Interior
The 991.2’s interior is pretty much identical to the outgoing model, with the main highlight being the new steering wheel. Based on the 2014 Porsche 918 Spyder’s , the three-spoke steering wheel looks and feels sportier, featuring improved grip sections and aluminum center inserts. When the Carrera is equipped with the optional Sport Chrono Package, it receives a mode switch derived from the hybrid map switch of the 918 Spyder. The new feature consists of a rotary dial with four positions for the driving modes, including Normal, Sport, Sport Plus, and Individual. Also, models fitted with the PDK transmission come with a Sport Response button that sets the drivetrain for maximum acceleration.
More updates are to be found in the technology department. There’s a new Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system (with an online navigation module) that can be operated by multi-touch gestures on the upgraded 7-inch display. It includes an expanded range of functions and simplified operation, Wi-Fi connectivity for smartphones, and Apple CarPlay for iPhones. For the first time, the 911 received Google Earth and Google Streetview besides real-time traffic information.Side-by-side comparison
Drivetrain
This is where the 991.2 is revolutionary rather than evolutionary. To address increasingly tougher fuel economy and CO2 emissions rules in Europe, Porsche decided to replace both the naturally aspirated 3.4- and 3.8-liter flat six engines of the Carrera and Carrera S, respectively, with a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter unit. The change makes the 991.2 the first-ever Carrera to use forced induction as well as the first base 911 to not feature a naturally aspirated engine.
Specifically developed for this model, the new turbo-six enhances the Carrera’s output by 20 horses and 43 pound-feet of torque. The base model now comes with 370 horsepower and 331 pound-feet of torque on tap, while the Carrera S is motivated by 420 horses and 368 pound-feet of twist.
The change makes the 991.2 the first-ever Carrera to use forced induction as well as the first base 911 to not feature a naturally aspirated engine.
Naturally, the updated output also makes the 911 Carrera quicker than its forerunner.
When equipped with the standard seven-speed manual transmission, the Carrera needs 4.4 seconds to hit 60 mph from a standing start and reaches a top speed of 183 mph. When ordered with the PDK transmission, the 0-to-60 mph sprint drops to 4.2 seconds, while the Sport Chrono package takes it down to an impressive four seconds flat. Top speed comes in at 182 mph in this configuration. The Carrera S is even quicker at 4.1 seconds and top speed at 191 mph, figures which are available with the manual transmission. Customers who choose the PDK over the stick will be able to experience 60 mph in 3.9 seconds or 3.7 ticks with Sport Chrono. For this model top speed is set at 190 mph.
On top of being quicker and more powerful, the new Carrera is also significantly more fuel efficient and greener, a couple of benefits that also come with turbocharging. Though specifics aren’t yet available, Porsche claims the new engine is ""almost twelve percent more efficient"" compared to the previous model ""according to the new European Drive Cycle."" Given the outgoing model was good for up to 23 mpg combined with the PDK, I expect the facelifted sports car to offer 25 mpg combined. Also, depending on configuration, the 991.2 could return up to 30 mpg on the highway.
But that’s not all. Along with being the first Carrera to feature turbocharging, the 991.2 is also the first Carrera to employ rear-axle steering. However, the system borrowed from the 2014 Porsche 911 Turbo and 2014 Porsche 911 GT3 is only available as an option. The system makes the Carrera more precise when changing lanes at higher speeds and delivers greater maneuverability in city traffic, thanks to a turning radius that is 1.6 feet smaller compared to models not using rear-axle steering. Also, the tech will also make it significantly quicker at the race track. According to Stuttgart, the new Carrera S with rear-axle steering lapped the Nurburgring Nordschleife in seven minutes and 30 seconds, making it ten seconds faster than the previous model. In short, it’s the fastest Carrera ever!
In the suspension department, the 991.2 got a reconfigured Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) system that offers improved driver control during fast cornering. A set of revised shock absorbers enhance comfort, while the updated tires have better grip and reduced rolling resistance. Porsche also offers an optional electro-hydraulic lift system that lifts the front axle by 1.57 inches at the push of a button, enabling the 911 to handle speed bumps or steep driveways.Drivetrain Specifications

Though facelifts usually don’t come with hefty premiums, the new turbo engine makes the base 911 Carrera $5,100 more expensive than its predecessor. It is priced from $89,400 with a manual transmission and from $92,600 with the PDK. The Carrera S now reached into $100K territory with its $103,400 sticker with a manual and $106,600 with the quick-shifting automatic. As for cabriolets, the Carrera retails from $101,700 and the Carrera S fetches $115,700 before options.Conclusion
From a design standpoint, picking between the 991 and 991.2 is only a matter of taste. Visual updates are mild, and although the 991.2 is a tad more aggressive thanks to its new bumper, some may still prefer the pre-facelift model. Including me. But when performance figures are taken into account, the 991.2 is the clear winner. It’s significantly quicker and more powerful, not to mention that its Nurburgring lap in Carrera S specifications and with rear-axle steering sounds pretty impressive.
On the other hand, the lack of a naturally aspirated engine will probably upset a lot of purists, who’d rather have the responsiveness and exhilarating growl of an all-motor over the turbo’s extra torque and improved fuel economy. Unfortunately, Porsche chose to sacrifice some of the Carrera’s heritage in order to prepare the 911, as well as its entire vehicle lineup, for the tougher fuel economy and CO2 emissions rules that are about to come into effect in Europe. Whether we like it or not, turbocharging is the future, and Porsche is already aware of that. What is your take?

New Porsche 911 Carrera boosts efficiency and expands dynamic repertoire. A new Porsche 911 is always highly anticipated – and the latest generation announced today is no exception. The core appeal of the rear-mounted flat-six engine in the 911 and its characteristic sporting driving experience resonate with owners and enthusiasts alike. This reputation for responsive and dynamic performance, forged both on the road and race track, coupled with unparalleled everyday usability, underpins the unstinting appeal of the 911.
The 911 has been the world’s best-selling sports car for decades. Now, the new generation has arrived, equipped to extend this status ever ahead into the future. New highlights include innovative twin-turbocharged flat-six engines, an advanced chassis with an even greater spread between performance and comfort, and a new infotainment system. With the benefit of more than four decades of experience with turbocharging – in both motor racing and production sports cars – the new engines in the new 911 Carrera set benchmarks in terms of performance, driving pleasure and efficiency.
The new option of rear-axle steering, available on the Carrera S models for the first time, further extends the range of dynamic virtuosity. The fastest lap time around the North Loop of the Nürburgring is reduced to 7 minutes and 30 seconds – ten seconds faster than before.
Many exterior features of the 911 Carrera have been visually refined: these include new headlights with four-point daytime running lights, handles inset to the door panel without recess covers, a redesigned engine lid with vertical louvres and new tail lights – including the now characteristic four-point brake light Porsche motif. Inside, a new Porsche Communication Management with an enhanced multi-touch display console offers a considerably expanded range of functions and greatly simplified operation. New turbocharged engines: 20 hp more and increased efficiency The completely new engine generation with twin turbocharging now featured in the 911 Carrera has raised power, efficiency and also intensified the emotional driving experience. As is typical of the 911, at the rear of the Carrera lies a 3.0-litre flat-six engine, developing 370 hp (272 kW). The 3.0-litre flat-six in the Carrera S now delivers 420 hp (309 kW). In both cases this represents a power boost of 20 hp (15 kW) over the prior model. The 911 Carrera S produces more horsepower courtesy of turbochargers with modified turbine compressors, a specific exhaust system and tuned engine management.
The new Porsche engines are characterised by significantly increased torque (60 Nm in each case), and with maximum torque of 450 Nm and 500 Nm respectively delivered constantly from 1,700 rpm up to 5,000 rpm in both cases, thus ensuring responsive performance. At the same time, with a maximum engine speed of 7,500 rpm the new generation clearly exceeds the top revs of conventional turbo engines – and, of course, both are underscored by the typical sonorous Porsche flat-six engine sound.
Every new 911 generation boasts enhanced performance and efficiency compared with their predecessors. The 911 Carrera Coupé with Porsche-Doppelkupplung (PDK) and Sport Chrono Package sprints from zero to 62 mph in 4.2 seconds – making it two tenths of a second faster than its predecessor. The 911 Carrera S with PDK and Sport Chrono Package achieves this benchmark in just 3.9 seconds (also 0.2 secs swifter). This means that it is the first 911 in the Carrera family to undercut the magic four second mark. And the top speeds of both models have also increased further: the 911 Carrera now has a top speed of 183 mph (an increase of 4 mph), while the 911 Carrera S now reaches 191 mph (an increase of 3 mph).
The Porsche 911 has always balanced performance and efficiency, sportiness and everyday usability. The new engines further extend the span of these apparent contradictions. Depending on the model, the 911 is now almost 12 per cent more efficient. The 911 Carrera with PDK transmission returns 38.2 mpg Combined (an increase of 3.8 mpg), while the 911 Carrera S with PDK consumes 36.7 mpg Combined (an increase of 4.2 mpg).
In terms of emissions, this translates to 169 g\/km CO2 for the Carrera PDK and 174 g\/km CO2 for the Carrera S PDK – placing both these models in Band H for the purposes of vehicle excise duty. Enhanced Sport Chrono Package option with ‘mode switch’ In conjunction with the optional Sport Chrono Package, the 911 Carrera now features a ‘mode switch’ on the steering wheel, derived from the hybrid mode switch of the 918 Spyder. The mode switch consists of a rotary control with four positions for the driving settings “Normal”, “Sport”, “Sport Plus” and “Individual”. Depending on the car’s specification, the latter setting enables drivers to configure their own individual vehicle set-up; eg Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), PDK transmission shifting strategy and sports exhaust system.
In combination with the PDK, the mode switch has an additional “Sport Response Button”. When this is pressed, the drivetrain is pre-conditioned for maximum acceleration for 20 seconds, in anticipation of an overtaking manoeuvre, for example. For a short time, the optimum gear is engaged and the engine management adjusted to an even more spontaneous response. A standard feature: re-engineered PASM chassis lowers ride height by 10mm The 911 Carrera is the benchmark for driving dynamics of all-round sports cars. With every new generation, Porsche further increases the spread between everyday comfort and track driving performance. For the first time, the new PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management) chassis, which lowers the ride height by ten millimetres, is a standard feature of every Carrera model. It further improves stability during fast cornering. At the same time, new dampers enhance comfort thanks to an even more precise response characteristic as well as improving body control during dynamic driving. The new wheel designs with five slim twin spokes carry tyres with reduced rolling resistance and enhanced performance. Furthermore, on all variants the width of the rear rims has increased by 0.5 to 11.5 inches. The rear tyres of the 911 Carrera S now measure 305 instead of 295 millimetres.
The active rear-axle steering that is available as an option for the 911 Carrera S is chassis technology adopted from the 911 Turbo and 911 GT3 (and 918 Spyder).
It further enhances the turn-in behaviour of the 911. In addition, it makes for high driving stability when changing lanes at high speeds. It also ensures greater manoeuvrability in city traffic thanks to the turning circle reduction of 0.5 metres. The improved handling is transmitted to the driver via the new steering wheel design, based on that fitted in the 918 Spyder. The basic steering wheel has a diameter of 375 millimetres; the optional ‘GT sport’ steering wheel measures 360 millimetres.
For unlimited everyday practicality, customers can choose a hydraulic lift system with integrated lifting cylinders in the struts of the front axle. Pressing a button increases the ground clearance at the nose by 40 millimetres within five seconds and thus prevents the vehicle underbody from hitting the ground, when traversing steep garage exits for example. New Porsche Communication Management including Online navigation The new 911 Carrera models feature a development of the Porsche Communication Management System (PCM) including Online satellite navigation and voice control. The PCM can be operated by performing multi-touch gestures on the seven-inch display, similar to operating a smartphone. User inputs by handwriting are also possible. Mobile phones and smartphones can now also be connected via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth™. The smartphone tray is integrated for the first time in the centre armrest, offering battery-saving charging and optimised mobile phone reception. Also new is the option of connecting an iPhone® to the PCM to use Apple CarPlay®.
Real-time traffic information is available for significantly improved route navigation. It gives the driver a quick overview of the traffic situation and guarantees dynamic adaptation of the route to this information. Google Earth® and Google Streetview® are also being integrated for the first time to offer better orientation. Other components of the PCM are Porsche Car Connect and the Porsche Connect app, which can be used for such functions as remote control of vehicle functions, transfer of destinations to the PCM for navigation and use of music streaming services by third-party providers via the PCM. New and extended optional assistance systems  An extended range of new and improved assistance systems are available on the new 911. The optional automatic speed control can now also brake moderately when the pre-set speed is exceeded, for example when driving downhill. Furthermore, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) option now has a coasting function in conjunction with the PDK transmission. When driving in a queue the clutches are disengaged, thus saving fuel with unpowered coasting. The optional Lane Change Assist monitors traffic behind with radar and uses LED lamps in the left and right of the mirror triangle to warn the driver about approaching vehicles in the blind spot. In addition, Porsche increases active safety with the multi-collision braking system as a standard feature.

UK ministers 'must come clean' over when they knew of VW scandal. UK ministers have been told to ""come clean"" on when they were first told about the Volkswagen scandal. 
 
Labour's shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood claimed the response of the Department for Transport (DfT) was ""unacceptable"". 
 
Meanwhile the car company announced Matthias Mueller as its new chief executive.  The former Porsche boss replaces Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down in the wake of the scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. 
 
Environmental group Greenpeace wrote to the Government to ask if it knew about the cheating of emissions tests before this month. 
 
The action against Volkswagen in the US began with diesel emissions research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in 2013 and 2014 which found a huge discrepancy in real-world performance and official laboratory tests. 
 
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced yesterday that diesel cars would be re-tested in the UK. 
 
Ms Greenwood said: ""Ministers must come clean and admit when they were first told about the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
""The International Council on Clean Transportation, the body which helped to expose the problem, warned a year ago that dangerously high levels of nitrogen oxide emissions were not confined to America. 
   Promoted stories   
""It is unacceptable that the Government waited this long to take action."" 
 
Greenpeace published figures which it claimed show manufacturers of diesel vehicles built to comply with European emissions standards spent up to £13.6 million lobbying EU politicians last year. 
 
Its UK executive director, John Sauven, said: ""It's time for our ministers to be completely transparent on what they knew and when about the pollution fix scandal. 
 
""Many people will want to know which matters more to our Government - the polluters' profits or the health of their citizens."" 
 
A DfT spokesman said the UK Government has been ""at the forefront of action at a European level"" to introduce updated emissions testing. 
 
He added that the ICCT report published in October last year ""did not identify the vehicles tested"". 
 
VW has admitted that 11 million vehicles worldwide were fitted with sophisticated software which conned testers in the US into believing their vehicles met environmental standards. 
 
The Environmental Protection Agency said 482,000 of the German car-maker's 2009-15 models in the US were fitted with the defeat device to switch engines to a cleaner mode when they are undergoing official emissions testing. 
 
Once on the road, the cars produced nitrogen oxide pollutants at up to 40 times the legal standard. 
 
VW has not revealed whether cars in the UK are affected but Germany's transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said 2.8 million vehicles in his country have the software. 
 
He added that VW vans as well as cars are caught up in the scandal. 
 
Mr McLoughlin said on Thursday that the Government was taking the ''unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously''. 
 
He announced that the UK regulator would investigate and re-run laboratory tests and called on the EU to conduct a Europe-wide investigation to find out if cars have been fitted with defeat devices on the continent. 
 
The British Lung Foundation urged the Government to commit to ""routine, independent real-world testing on all cars"". 
 
Mr Winterkorn resigned over the scandal but insisted he was not aware of ""any wrongdoing on my part''. 
 
According to reports the 68-year-old could receive a severance package of up to two years of his annual salary, which would be worth over £22 million. 
 
Mr Mueller's appointment as his replacement was announced after the stock markets had closed so it is not possible to say exactly how investors will take the news, though it is fair to say his appointment was widely expected. 
 
Volkswagen shares fell 4.3% to 108 euros (£80) today, meaning the carmaker has lost about a third of its value, or 26 billion euros (£19 billion), since the start of the crisis. 
 
The Volkswagen board is also expected to dismiss high-level engineers and designers, though no further details have been released yet. 
 
Mr Mueller, 62, formerly worked as VW's head product strategist, and is understood to have substantial backing among the company's 20-member supervisory board. 
 
Analysts said his first tasks at VW will be to clean out its senior management team, restructure costs and drive sales. 
 
Mr Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying IT has worked for various parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors for the top job. 
 
Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW. 
 
He  is known for his laid-back style, often appearing at car shows in a casual jumper rather than the expensively-tailored suits favoured by fellow executives.

He has until recently joked that he was too old to run VW, which is the largest carmaker in the world by sales. 
 
Under his leadership, Porsche has successfully added new models and is expected to boost sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early.. VW names Matthias Mueller as CEO. ""It is crucial that something like this never happens again,"" Mueller said at the press conference in Wolfsburg. Photo: Bloomberg Volkswagen appointed Porsche brand chief Matthias Mueller as chief executive officer as the German car maker reels from the biggest crisis in its history.

The supervisory board, which met for seven hours on Friday, named four-decade company veteran Mueller to replace Martin Winterkorn, who quit Wednesday as the diesel cheating scandal widened and countries around the globe announced investigations. Mueller will lead Porsche as well until a successor is found.

""My most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group - by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation, Mueller said in a statement. ""Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do everything it can to develop and implement the most stringent compliance and governance standards in our industry.""

The 62-year-old Porsche chief takes charge a week after VW was found to have cheated on diesel-emission tests in the US beginning in 2009, triggering billions in potential fines and a US criminal investigation. The crisis wiped about €20 billion off VW's market value this week, and the company estimates irregularities on diesel-emission readings extend to 11 million vehicles around the world.

Winfried Vahland will take over a newly created position with responsibility for all of North America. Michael Horn will remain as the US chief and report to him. Vahland currently runs the Skoda division and prior to that was responsible for the auto maker's operations in China. Horn at an event on Monday in New York apologised profusely for what VW had done, saying: ""We have totally screwed up.""

""We need a climate where problems aren't hidden,"" Bernd Osterloh, VW's top labour leader said at a press conference in Wolfsburg, Germany. ""Volkswagen needs a fundamental cultural change.""

VW shares closed down 4.85 euros on Friday, bringing their loss for the week to 34 per cent.

The supervisory board also announced that Hans Dieter Poetsch, who is currently the finance chief, will, as previously planned, become chairman of the supervisory board following an extraordinary shareholders meeting in November to elect him to the board.

Mueller was already touted as a potential CEO successor when former chairman Ferdinand Piech failed in a bid to oust Winterkorn in April. He's run the maker of the 911 sports car since October 2010. Mueller, who studied information technology and joined the Audi division as a toolmaking apprentice in the early 1970s, is the first non-engineer to run VW since 1992, when Carl Hahn retired from the post. Hahn studied economics.

Mueller - who has a cool, cosmopolitan demeanor - boosted Porsche profit 62 per cent over four years. Deliveries are on track to surpass 200,000 vehicles for the first time in 2015, with the addition of new models such as the Macan compact SUV.

""It is crucial that something like this never happens again,"" Mueller said at the press conference in Wolfsburg.. New Porsche 911 boosts power and efficiency. The venerable Porsche 911 will be appearing at the Frankfurt motorshow with a new, new engines and new driving tech. 

The Porsche 911 is the most successful and most popular sportscar in history and the only way that the company can maintain this status quo is to keep steadily improving the vehicle before its competitors loom too large in the rear-view mirror. 
 
So when the new 911 Carrera hard top and drop tops make their global debut in Germany on September 17 they will do so, for the first time in history with turbocharged engines. As well as upping performance by 20hp across the range - the Carrera now has 370hp on tap and the ‘S' variant 420hp, - the new force-induced flat-six engines boast better fuel economy, lower emissions and an improved 0-100kph time. 
 
As well as new engines, for the first time ever the Carreras get the option of four-wheel steering while the exterior has been tweaked with new front and rear bumpers, air intakes and lighting cluster designs.. VW Development Heads 'Suspended'. The R&D chiefs working with its core passenger car division, luxury brand Audi and sports car maker Porsche are reported to have been put on leave, although all three companies declined to comment. 
 
The firm has been at the centre of a controversy concerning the levels of emissions produced by some of their cars. 
 
Volkswagen was forced to apologise last week when it was discovered that it had installed a ""cheat device"" in some of its cars in order to trick emission tests in the US. 
 
The devices were able to detect when cars were undergoing tests, and would switch the vehicle to a low emission mode in order to achieve more favourable results. 
 
This means that many people bought cars which were much less environmentally friendly than they had been led to believe. 
 
Then CEO of the Volkswagen Group,  Martin Winterkorn, was forced to resign over the revelations and was replaced by Matthias Müller, who had been the chief of Volkswagen subsidiary Porsche since 2010.

    © Sky News, 2. Volkswagen diesel scandal: Why it's so much worse than it looks for VW. Pretend you are a director of VW at yet another emergency board meeting. Over the weekend, Switzerland has announced a ban on the sale of all VW's, affecting 180,000 unsold cars and trucks. 

That doesn't really even seem to matter, since your company has already suspended US and European sales of the mainstay of its range, the 2.0 litre TDI diesel. Last year VW sold 2.44 million diesel cars, or 25 per cent of its total output (including petrol and electric). 

But as serious as the diesel problem is, the main game here is so much larger, for two reasons. 

First, it's not just a question about VW's diesel, but whether the diesel engine itself has a commercial future. Or is this the moment the global auto industry uses to do a hard reboot and shift to electric, greenlighting the electric car for the mainstream?  We'll get to that in a minute. 

First, the board meeting. VW is a family of brands – Skoda, Audi, SEAT, Bentley (the 4WD turbo diesel Bentley Bentayga is already set for release this year) and even Porsche. (Yes, Porsche. It sells a diesel 4WD the engine for which may have come from VW.) 

Did I mention that Porsche also owns 30 per cent of the voting equity of VW? In fact, there are two Porsche family representatives just across the VW board table. They look very uncomfortable. 
What now? 
Forget the recriminations, and who knew what when, and assume the sackings, fines and custodial sentences are a given. The central question you are gathered around to answer is: what now? 

As a board member, you will hear argument that the company must continue with the diesel, because the shareholders (including the director, seated to your left, representing the government of the German state of Lower Saxony, which has a 20 per cent voting interest) are demanding their dividend, which they use for public works including schools and hospitals. The Porsche family may be agreeing, although it could just be the light. 

At the same time you will be aware of tens of thousands of workers and their families who are facing financial losses in part from possibility of job cuts, and second from the fall in the value of VW stock. 

You all agree that pressing on with diesel is the best course of action. The question is how? 

The balance sheet shows VW has around €351 billion ($560 billion) in total assets deployed around the world, manufacturing, assembling, distributing, maintaining and financing cars. 

Of that, VW has €44 billion ($70.1 billion) in property plant and equipment. You will have to decide how much of this to write off and then put a number to what will be a multi-billion Euro amount to re-tool the asset base to bring diesel up to the lied-about specification, or at least to that of other diesel car makers. 
Sales slump 
For the next couple of years, you will have to get used to sales which could be 75 per cent of what they were. Profit structures being what they are, this could cut earnings by more than half, before the write-offs, which will run for years. 

One very important issue will be whether the other makers have been cheating as well. If they haven't then VW could copy their technology and compete head to head. 

But if the others manufacturers have been cheating – and remember this is a distinct possibility given that the problem has been going on for ten years – then the cheating could be industry wide. 

It is here the current thinking on diesel needs to be factored in. 

There have been a rash of serious complaints in Europe and the US about diesel in the past few years – for example Kings College London is claiming 5800 premature deaths from emissions, while the US is claiming 10 times that figure. 

All this time the electric car will be gaining traction. By which is meant charging stations, the global re-think about what a car needs to be (who needs 500 kilometre range when most trips are to the shops?) carbon pricing and of course China, the car industry for which is going global and electric as fast as it can. 

Meanwhile the value of Tesla, at $US33 billion ($47 billion), is already more than half that of VW and it only sells 1 per cent of the cars. Why bother retooling for diesel to arrive at the same time the electric car has gone mainstream, either by government degree (because of emissions) or consumer taste. 
Significant liability 
And now we get to the second issue. Buried in the VW accounts is a finance book with €135 billion in liabilities. The assets backing these liabilities will be pretty much entirely vehicles, the value of which has just fallen very significantly. (If you bought a VW diesel yesterday, you are already looking at a much larger drop to resale value than you bargained for. Multiply that out and it's a hefty class action). 

So as well as a car maker, VW is also virtually a bank, requiring a portion of its book to be written off too. There may be questions about bail-outs. It is a dead certainty that Angela Merkel will soon be addressing the board in her official capacity. This just keeps getting worse. 

Alex Pollak is CEO of Loftus Peak , a fund manager that specialises in building listed global portfolios for self-managed super funds. 

The story Volkswagen diesel scandal: Why it's so much worse than it looks for VW first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .. Volkswagen names Porsche chief Matthias Mueller as new CEO. WOLFSBURG - Volkswagen announced on Friday that it would appoint Matthias Mueller, the head of its Porsche unit, as its new chief executive following the departure of Martin Winterkorn in an emissions cheating scandal. 
 
""Matthias Mueller has strong strategic, corporate and social qualities,"" acting chairman Berthold Huber told a news conference. 
 
""We appreciate his critical and constructive approach,"" Huber said.. VW names head of Porsche unit as new CEO. Volkswagen's board has named Matthias Mueller, the head of the group's Porsche unit, to be the new CEO and to lead the world's top-selling automaker past a growing emissions-rigging scandal. 
Click to Continue ». Porsche buys 1.5 percent of VW ordinary shares from Suzuki. BERLIN — German automaker Porsche SE says it is buying 1.5 percent stake of ordinary shares in Volkswagen AG from Suzuki.

The purchase raises Porsche's share of Volkswagen AG's ordinary shares to 52.2 percent, and its stake in VW's subscribed capital to 32.4 percent.

The move comes days after Volkswagen was hit by a scandal over allegedly rigged U.S. emissions tests in diesel vehicles.

Porsche said in a statement Saturday that it considers the purchase ""as a strong commitment to its core investment and emphasizes its role as an anchor shareholder"" in Volkswagen.. VW has named a new CEO. AP	See Also Report: Porsche CEO will take charge at VW VW CEO is out It will be tricky for VW to name a new CEO Volkswagen has named Matthias Müller as its new CEO. The 62-year-old Müller was CEO of Porsche, which is among VW Group's brands. Müller's appointment comes as VW reels from an emissions-cheating scandal that has affected 11 million vehicles worldwide. ""My most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group – by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation,"" Müller said in a statement. ""Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do everything it can to develop and implement the most stringent compliance and governance standards in our industry. If we manage to achieve that then the Volkswagen Group with its innovative strength, its strong brands and above all its competent and highly motivated team has the opportunity to emerge from this crisis stronger than before."" The VW supervisory board met Friday to vote on Müller's candidacy. Made up of members of VW Group management, labor leaders, representatives of the Porsche family, and the government of Lower Saxony, where VW is headquartered, the supervisory board has moved swiftly to deal with the scandal since the news broke last week. Former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who had survived a management crisis earlier this year, resigned on Tuesday. Bernd Osterloh, who leads the VW Group Works Council, the automaker's union, said in a statement that ""when it comes to leadership appointments the Volkswagen Group does not need hasty decisions. He added: ""We know and value Matthias Müller for his determination and decisiveness. He does not work on his own, rather he is a team player. That is what Volkswagen needs now."" Müller has been with the VW Group for decades. He began his career in the German auto industry in the 1970s, as an apprentice before going to college, and then rose through the ranks. He has presided over Porsche's transformation from a maker of expensive sports cars to a company that sells luxury SUV and sedans in both the developed and developing world. Müller also has the support of former VW chairman Ferdinand Piëch, who was ousted from the VW board earlier this year, but continues to exert influence. During VW's management crisis, Müller was suggested as a CEO to replace Winterkorn, who was under fire for VW's weak performance in the US and its sprawling worldwide growth. Various media reports has also noted that Müller was supported by both the Porsche family (of which Piëch is a member) and VW's powerful labor unions. Müller will continue as Chairman of Porsche, the VW Group said, until a replacement is found. Additional VW executives, including its US leadership, were also slated to be dismissed. When we have details on that, we'll update. NOW WATCH: Watch Oculus announce the long-awaited virtual reality version of Netflix. UK ministers 'must come clean' over when they knew of VW scandal. UK ministers have been told to ""come clean"" on when they were first told about the Volkswagen scandal. 
 
Labour's shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood claimed the response of the Department for Transport (DfT) was ""unacceptable"". 
 
Meanwhile the car company announced Matthias Mueller as its new chief executive.  The former Porsche boss replaces Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down in the wake of the scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. 
 
Environmental group Greenpeace wrote to the Government to ask if it knew about the cheating of emissions tests before this month. 
 
The action against Volkswagen in the US began with diesel emissions research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in 2013 and 2014 which found a huge discrepancy in real-world performance and official laboratory tests. 
 
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced yesterday that diesel cars would be re-tested in the UK. 
 
Ms Greenwood said: ""Ministers must come clean and admit when they were first told about the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
""The International Council on Clean Transportation, the body which helped to expose the problem, warned a year ago that dangerously high levels of nitrogen oxide emissions were not confined to America. 
   Promoted stories   
""It is unacceptable that the Government waited this long to take action."" 
 
Greenpeace published figures which it claimed show manufacturers of diesel vehicles built to comply with European emissions standards spent up to £13.6 million lobbying EU politicians last year. 
 
Its UK executive director, John Sauven, said: ""It's time for our ministers to be completely transparent on what they knew and when about the pollution fix scandal. 
 
""Many people will want to know which matters more to our Government - the polluters' profits or the health of their citizens."" 
 
A DfT spokesman said the UK Government has been ""at the forefront of action at a European level"" to introduce updated emissions testing. 
 
He added that the ICCT report published in October last year ""did not identify the vehicles tested"". 
 
VW has admitted that 11 million vehicles worldwide were fitted with sophisticated software which conned testers in the US into believing their vehicles met environmental standards. 
 
The Environmental Protection Agency said 482,000 of the German car-maker's 2009-15 models in the US were fitted with the defeat device to switch engines to a cleaner mode when they are undergoing official emissions testing. 
 
Once on the road, the cars produced nitrogen oxide pollutants at up to 40 times the legal standard. 
 
VW has not revealed whether cars in the UK are affected but Germany's transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said 2.8 million vehicles in his country have the software. 
 
He added that VW vans as well as cars are caught up in the scandal. 
 
Mr McLoughlin said on Thursday that the Government was taking the ''unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously''. 
 
He announced that the UK regulator would investigate and re-run laboratory tests and called on the EU to conduct a Europe-wide investigation to find out if cars have been fitted with defeat devices on the continent. 
 
The British Lung Foundation urged the Government to commit to ""routine, independent real-world testing on all cars"". 
 
Mr Winterkorn resigned over the scandal but insisted he was not aware of ""any wrongdoing on my part''. 
 
According to reports the 68-year-old could receive a severance package of up to two years of his annual salary, which would be worth over £22 million. 
 
Mr Mueller's appointment as his replacement was announced after the stock markets had closed so it is not possible to say exactly how investors will take the news, though it is fair to say his appointment was widely expected. 
 
Volkswagen shares fell 4.3% to 108 euros (£80) today, meaning the carmaker has lost about a third of its value, or 26 billion euros (£19 billion), since the start of the crisis. 
 
The Volkswagen board is also expected to dismiss high-level engineers and designers, though no further details have been released yet. 
 
Mr Mueller, 62, formerly worked as VW's head product strategist, and is understood to have substantial backing among the company's 20-member supervisory board. 
 
Analysts said his first tasks at VW will be to clean out its senior management team, restructure costs and drive sales. 
 
Mr Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying IT has worked for various parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors for the top job. 
 
Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW. 
 
He  is known for his laid-back style, often appearing at car shows in a casual jumper rather than the expensively-tailored suits favoured by fellow executives.

Paul Walker’s Daughter Files Wrongful Death Suit Against Porsche. Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Meadow Walker, the daughter of Fast and Furious actor Paul Walker, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Porsche. The lawsuit is specifically targeted towards the Porsche Carrera GT which is the vehicle Walker was a passenger in when it was crashed with Roger Rodas behind the wheel. Both men died in the crash. In the lawsuit, it is claimed that the seatbelt of the hardcore German supercar “snapped Walker’s torso back with thousands of pounds of force, thereby breaking his ribs and pelvis.” It is reported that Walker was trapped inside the Carrera GT for over a minute before the car caught fire which ultimately led to his death. Additionally, the lawsuit explains how the Carrera GT didn’t have adequate safety features which could have prevented the crash like an electronic stability control system. It also asserts the the fire was triggered by faulty rubber fuel lines. Meadow Walker’s attorney Jeff Milam told People Magazine that “the Porsche Carrera GT is a dangerous car. It doesn’t belong on the street. And we shouldn’t be without Paul Walker or his friend, Roger Rodas.” CATEGORIESBreaking NewsCar News TAGSPaul Walker VIAPeople Magazine CONTACT Sales info Email the author Tip us SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Brad Anderson

Top Speed:201 mph Posted on 09.16.2015 19:00 by James Wolfcale   No matter how fast and well-rounded a car is, there will always be those who want to make it faster and… uh… rounder. Take the 2016 Mercedes-AMG GT for instance — by all accounts an outstanding sports car with a powerful and sonorous V-8 under its long hood and spot-on looks. It’s a car just about any of us would love to have in our driveways, and Mercedes-AMG have spent hundreds or millions of dollars and invested countless man hours to make sure that’s the case. So, you sort of have to give the side-eye glance to tuning outfits claiming they can improve upon the product of a multi-billion-dollar multi-national corporation.
But Brabus has been at this for nearly 40 years now. Just like Mercedes-Benz’s own in-house tuning arm AMG once was, Brabus is an independent tuning company that’s become known for turning out some ridiculously powerful Mercs with sinister characters fit for a Jason Bourne antagonist. How ridiculous? The 720-horsepower CLS-based 2012 Brabus Rocket still holds the title as the world’s fastest street-legal sedan at 227 mph.
Now Brabus has turned its attention to the new Mercedes-AMG GT S, and while it’s not quite as off the wall as the Rocket, it does look like a pretty complete package. The Brabus AMG GT S boasts several performance enhancements over the stock GT, including a significant boost in power, and a few visual and aerodynamic updates that add a bit of aggression without coming off as too over the top. Let’s take a closer look.

It’s rare, but it’s always nice when body kits are functional, and that certainly seems to be the case with the Brabus AMG GT S.
As shown here, the components are finished with a gloss clear-coat, but Brabus also offers them with a matte finish or in matching or contrasting body colors.
The additional bodywork has been sculpted from carbon fiber using a wind tunnel, which Brabus says has optimized aerodynamics. As shown here, the components are finished with a gloss clear-coat, but Brabus also offers them with a matte finish or in matching or contrasting body colors.
Around the front, Brabus says the new lip spoiler reduces lift at the front axle, and the air intakes on either side of the front fascia get carbon fiber inserts with integrated LED strips.
The front fenders get new carbon-fiber air outlets that extent to the door seams and include illuminated blue Brabus logos. The new side skirts accentuate the car’s lowered stance and help manage air flow around the sides. The rear gets a small wing and new lower bodywork that houses the quad exhaust and a diffuser.
It all sits on ultra-light, forged Brabus wheels (20 inches at the front and 21 at the rear) and a suspension system that lowers the car by about half an inch. The wheels are available in mirror finish (seen here) or brushed titanium finish. Brabus says all the modifications add up to improved handling at low speeds and better stability at high speeds.Interior
When entering the interior, drivers are greeted with illuminated Brabus-branded carbon-fiber door sills, which can be switched between red and white (real Pep Boys stuff if you ask me). The pedals can be switched out for matte-anodized or chrome plated items and the wheel-mounted paddle shifters have been reshaped in aluminum for improved ergonomics. The car shown here has an otherwise standard interior, but the Brabus upholstery shop offers a nearly limitless range of leather and color combinations to suit owner preferences. Custom carbon-fiber and wood surface inlays are also offered.Drivetrain
Thanks to a new engine management system that remaps injection and ignition and bumps up boost pressure, the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 now produces a nice round 600 horsepower at 6,400 rpm and 553 pound-feet of torque at 4,800 rpm, which are 97-horsepower and 74-pound-feet improvements over the stock AMG GT S. Brabus claims a 0-60 time of 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 201 mph — 0.1 second quicker to 60 mph and 8 mph faster at the top end.
The Brabus titanium exhaust system adds both bark and bite and weighs 40 percent less than the stock exhaust system. The system also features a cockpit-controlled butterfly valve that takes the stock GT’s exhaust management to a new level. Its even louder than the standard exhaust in its default setting, but can be switched to what Brabus calls a “coming home” mode to make it quieter than the standard car. Other than that, the rest of the AMG GT’s drivetrain is carried over, including the seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle and optional carbon-ceramic brakes.Prices
Brabus hasn’t announced pricing, but we wouldn’t expect much change back from a donor AMG GT S and about $50,000.Competition2016 Porsche 911 Turbo We don’t have many solid details on the newly face-lifted 2016 Porsche 911 Turbo yet, but if past examples are anything to go by, then it should be extremely fast and very competent. We’re expecting it to receive updated looks, with new lights and a slightly more aggressive front fascia.
Even though just about every 911 model (baring the GT3 ) will be turbocharged moving forward, the 911 Turbo will still be at the top of the heap in terms of power and pace. The base 911 Turbo should get a power bump from its current 520 horsepower, while the Turbo S could have a figure approaching 600 horsepower. Power will still be sent to all four wheels, which should make for neck-snapping acceleration.
You can read our speculative review here .2016 McLaren 570S Coupe The 570S Coupe represents McLaren’s first foray into the sub-$200,000 sports car territory currently occupied by the Mercedes-AMG GT and Porsche 911 Turbo. With a detuned version McLaren’s twin-turbo 3.8-liter V-8 mounted behind the seats, the 570S sends 562 horsepower to the rear wheels, which translates to a 0-60 time of 3.2 seconds.
With a curb weight of just 2,895 pounds, it’s also by far the lightest car in this segment, which should make it extraordinary agile. Variants including a drop-top Spider and a unique grand touring model with panoramic glass roof are also rumored to be on the way.
You can read our full review here .Conclusion
I like what Brabus has done here, but car customization by its very nature is a very personal thing, and when I ask myself if I would take a Brabus AMG GT S over a standard AMG GT S, the answer would have to be no. Personally, I prefer the cleaner, less cluttered looks of the stock GT S. The extra power would be nice, but if Mercedes-AMG thinks 503 horsepower is enough, then it’s enough for me as well. Plus, Mercedes-AMG has said there are faster in-house GT variants on the way , so I’d be content to just wait. But, as long as there are customers who want to go faster today, then there will always be a place for companies like Brabus.

Press Release
Lending an exclusive car an even more thrilling appearance has been the domain of BRABUS (Brabus-Allee, D-46240 Bottrop, phone + 49 (0) 2041 \/ 777-0, fax + 49 \/ (0) 2041 \/ 777 111, Internet www.brabus.com) for almost four decades. At the IAA 2015 in Frankfurt am Main, the exclusive sports program for the Mercedes-AMG GT and GT S models celebrates its world premiere. With an output increase to 441 kW \/ 600 HP (591 bhp) and a peak torque of 750 Nm (553 lb-ft), the two-seat car reaches a top speed of 325 km\/h (201 mph).
From the outside, the sports car with BRABUS design impresses with aerodynamic-enhancement components made from clear-coated carbon, ultra-light BRABUS Monoblock F forged wheels, a sports suspension with a multitude of selectable settings for damping and ride height, and a sports exhaust system made from especially lightweight titanium with electronically controlled sound management.
BRABUS fine leather interiors and inlays made from real carbon and precious wood upgrade the cockpit of the two-door car.
You can never have enough power, especially in a sports car. That is why the BRABUS engine specialists have developed the PowerXtra B40 – 600 performance kit for the eight-cylinder twin-turbo engine of the GT S. A plug-and-play control module is adapted to the engine electronics. It features new mapping for injection and ignition while also moderately increasing the boost pressure. After the installation, the engine puts out an extra 66 kW \/ 90 HP (88 bhp) and produces 100 Nm (74 lb-ft) of added torque. Of course, the tuned version complies with the same strict emissions standards as the production car.
After the upgrade, the GT S has a rated power output of 441 kW \/ 600 HP (591 bhp) at 6,400 rpm and a peak torque of 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) at 4,800 rpm. It sprints from rest to 100 km\/h (62 mph) in just 3.6 seconds. The top speed with BRABUS engine tuning jumps from 310 to 325 km\/h (190 to 201 mph).
Like all other BRABUS components, the performance kit for the GT S is backed by the exemplary BRABUS Tuning Warranty® of three years, up to 100,000 kilometers\/62,000 miles (see BRABUS Warranty Terms and Conditions, updated July 2013). Technology partner MOTUL supplies the high-tech lubricants for the entire powertrain.
The ideal complement to the engine tuning or an attractive upgrade for all standard GT or GT S models is the BRABUS quad sports exhaust made from extremely lightweight titanium with four tailpipes made from a combination of titanium and carbon. This exhaust system weighs about 40 percent less than the production exhaust and optimizes the power delivery of the V8 engine to boot. As a special feature, this exhaust is fitted with electronically controlled butterfly valves operated from the cockpit. The standard setting offers a “coming home” sound tuning that is quieter than the production exhaust. It further increases the appeal of the thrilling sports car for the neighbors when it returns home late at night. When the valves are open, the eight-cylinder sounds significantly sportier and more powerful than with the production exhaust.
The material of choice for the BRABUS aerodynamic-enhancement components is lightweight yet extremely strong carbon, the same material used in Formula 1 racing. The components were developed in the wind tunnel and lend the GT or GT S version of the sports car a more thrilling design while optimizing the aerodynamics. All bodywork components come with a clear-coated carbon racing-look finish. They are also available with a matte coating and can optionally be painted in vehicle or contrasting color.
The front bumper of the coupe receives a visual upgrade with the BRABUS front spoiler. What is more: at high speeds, lift on the front axle is further reduced, resulting in even more stable handling. The two BRABUS covers for the side air intakes of the bumper lend the two-seater an even more striking face while optimizing the routing of cooling air. Integrated LED side markers optimize active safety.
BRABUS also sharpens the profile of the sports car: the new design air outlets for the front fenders lend the GT S a full-blooded racing touch. They immediately catch the eye due to their integrated BRABUS logotypes that light up in blue when the keyless-entry remote or a door handle are operated. The BRABUS rocker panels give the front-engine sports car an even lower and sleeker visual stance. They also optimize the airflow between the front and rear wheel arches.
The rear receives a more athletic look with the BRABUS rear airfoil and the BRABUS diffuser with tailor-made cutouts for the four tailpipes of the BRABUS sports exhaust system. In addition, these aerodynamic-enhancement components also contribute to optimized handling stability at high speeds.
The forged wheels were custom-developed for the GT and GT S and also play an essential role in the thrilling BRABUS look. The staggered tire\/wheel combination with diameters of 20 inches on the front axle and 21 inches at the rear adds further emphasis to the wedge shape of the two-seater.
Thanks to a manufacturing process that uses state-of-the-art forging technology, the BRABUS Monoblock F “PLATINUM EDITION” cross-spoke wheels are extremely light yet especially robust. The wheels are available with a mirror-polished, brushed or titanium-colored finish and come in sizes 9.5Jx20 at the front and 11Jx21 on the rear axle. Technology partners Continental, Pirelli and YOKOHAMA supply the extremely wide high-performance tires of sizes 275\/30 ZR 20 and 305\/25 ZR 21.
The BRABUS sports springs are tailored specifically to these low profile tires. They lower the ride height of GT S by about 15 millimeters (.6 inches).
For the cockpit of the sports car, the BRABUS interior designers have developed exclusive accessories such as carbon scuff plates with stainless-steel inserts and a backlit BRABUS logo, whose color changes between red and white, and matte anodized or chrome-plated aluminum pedals. Special BRABUS aluminum paddle shifters in an even more ergonomic position on the steering wheel make even more precise gear changes possible.
The BRABUS upholstery shop creates BRABUS fine leather interiors finished with masterful workmanship for the GT and GT S as well. They can be tailored as precisely to the owner’s preferences with regard to the choice of leather, Alcantara and color as the design and the upholstery.
Individual requests can also be fulfilled when it comes to the inlays for the dashboard, center console and door panels. BRABUS manufactures carbon and precious wood trim sets in any desired color and with many different surface finishes.

They’ve just released what they call a redesign Porsche 991 911 and while we don’t see a whole lot of novelties from the looks of it, under the bonnet a whole revolution is at work.

Naturally aspirated engines are dead for the Porsche 911 range. They’ve just released what they call a redesign Porsche 991 911 and while we don’t see a whole lot of novelties from the looks of it, under the bonnet a whole revolution is at work. Let’s cut to the chase here. The Porsche 911 has been known for their naturally aspirated engines. At the beginning, they’ve integrated air cooled machines which sounded magnificently, but with the power increase, all the regulations for emissions and reliability, water cooling had to be installed. Now, the naturally aspirated engines are once again the first to be hit. 

The new Porsche 911 doesn’t have a naturally aspirated engine in its line up. Even the cheapest, most pitiful and the slowest of the lot is a Turbo and that means that the real 911 Turbo (and the Turbo S), which were the holy grails of motoring, won’t receive love and appraisal they’ve received up until now. The three liter six cylinder engine, aided by two turbochargers, is integrated at the back instead of the older, bigger naturally aspirated unit. So, the power and the torque are up, but the displacement, emissions, fuel consumption, weight and presumably the sound (as crazy as it seems) are down. 

Porsche had to do this because emission norms are rather thought to follow with naturally aspirated engines (Ferrari, McLaren and Jaguar had the same problem). Luckily, the power was increased and it was increased by quite a lot. The regular Carrera gained 20 HP and 44 lb ft of torque. Basically, 370 HP and 331 lb ft of torque are at work now here. A tiny bit lighter car with a refined turbocharged engine now accelerates to 60 mph in 4,1 seconds. That is a true achievement for an entry level Porsche 911, isn’t it? The 50 HP more powerful Carrera S does the same in less than 4 seconds and it can hit more than 190 mph. That’s huge. Only the Porsche 911 GTS could reach such a performance nirvana in the past. 

As for the other version, nothing special changed. Or we at least aren’t acquainted with the changes in the engine compartment of other units. What we do know is that Porsche made some styling tweaks like integrating a vertical rear intake mesh (as a retro throwback of some kind), the LED daily lights changed the position, front splitter was adjusted and the rear lights were changed. 

True, some science is behind all of that so the car is presumably better at cutting through air and more efficient, but we really think that it didn’t recei….

In a speech at the University of Massachusetts on Thursday, Yellen made the case for a rate hike this year, though argued that the decision would continue to rely on economic data. Yellen said that inflation would build gradually over the next few years. 
 
""Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter,"" Yellen said. 
 
Markets have been erratic since the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged at their meeting last week with investors interpreting that as another sign of uncertainty. 
 
""The reason why the stock market traded off after [the Fed's decision to hold rates] was it created a lot of doubt in the minds of investors about the health of the U.S. economy,"" Don Ellenberger, senior vice president at Federated Investors, told TheStreet . Yellen ""created a lot of uncertainty about what the Fed's strategy was for when they would begin raising rates.""

    next   last ». 2017 Porsche 911 Makes World Debut at IAA 2015 in Frankfurt. Porsche revealed the 911 & 911S models with downsized engines at the Frankfurt international motor show. Porsche has finally changed its engines after 50 years. The automaker has finally downsized the engines in its latest models. The downsizing of engines by Porsche has occurred to meet fuel and emission standards.
Porsche unveiled its latest models the 911 and 911S at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The new models showed Porsche has removed its aspirated high-revving flat sixes. The engines of the new models have been turbocharged instead to control emissions and fuel economy.
In both the 2017 911 & 911S engines the flat six 3.0 liter 9A2 motor is used. But the turbocharging of the engines has changed the torque. The torque is now 420 hp\/ 368 lb-ft torques on the 911S. While the 911 model has a torque of 370 hp\/ 331 lb-ft. 
The 3.8 liter 9A1 motor has been completely removed from the 911 line of Porsche. The engine can only be found in the sold out 2016 Cayman GT4 now. The Porsche 911 line was introduced in 2012. Right now the 911 is in its 6th generation.
The internal code of the line is 991. Porsche has brought the changes in its 911 models for the year 2016. There have also been subtle changes in the 911 body. The most obvious design changes are in the front and rear bumpers.
Only die hard Porsche fans will be able to notice the changes. The most significant change in the 911 is its speed. The new turbocharged 911 cars will be faster and more environmentally friendly.  Porsche claims the fuel economy of the cars has been increased by 10%, reported BMWBlog. . Porsche head Mueller named as new CEO of Volkswagen. Porsche head Matthias Mueller was named as the new CEO of Volkswagen, the company said on Friday. 

Mueller replaced Martin Winterkorn, who resigned two days ago amid an escalating emissions cheating scandal, Xinhua reported.. Volkswagen to name Porsche boss as new CEO: Source. BERLIN - Volkswagen will name the head of sports car maker Porsche as its group chief executive on Friday to succeed Martin Winterkorn who quit over the diesel emissions scandal, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
 
Matthias Mueller, VW's former head product strategist who joined the group's top management board in March, is favoured by a majority on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as new CEO at a meeting on Friday, the source said. 
 
Winterkorn, an engineer by training who spent almost nine years at the helm of Europe's largest automaker, resigned on Wednesday, taking responsibility for the biggest business scandal in VW's 78-year history. 
 
Mueller, 62, who held various positions at VW's luxury flagship Audi before taking charge of Porsche in 2010, was also the favourite candidate for VW's top job by long-time chairman Ferdinand Piech, who quit in April after a power struggle with Winterkorn. 
 
Labour representatives, occupying half of the 20 board seats, would ""only accept a personality with great technical and entrepreneurial expertise as well as great social competence,"" VW works council chief Bernd Osterloh said in a letter to employees published on Thursday. 
 
VW declined to comment. 
 
Mueller's appointment will be part of a raft of personnel decisions and dismissals by the board including the firing of R&D chiefs at Audi and Porsche, Ulrich Hackenberg and Wolfgang Hatz, as well as VW's top U.S. executive Michael Horn, a source told Reuters earlier on Thursday.. UK ministers 'must come clean' over when they knew of VW scandal. UK ministers have been told to ""come clean"" on when they were first told about the Volkswagen scandal.

Meanwhile the car company announced Matthias Mueller as its new chief executive.  The former Porsche boss replaces Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down in the wake of the scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. 
 
Environmental group Greenpeace wrote to the Government to ask if it knew about the cheating of emissions tests before this month. 
 
The action against Volkswagen in the US began with diesel emissions research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in 2013 and 2014 which found a huge discrepancy in real-world performance and official laboratory tests. 
 
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced yesterday that diesel cars would be re-tested in the UK. 
 
Ms Greenwood said: ""Ministers must come clean and admit when they were first told about the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
""The International Council on Clean Transportation, the body which helped to expose the problem, warned a year ago that dangerously high levels of nitrogen oxide emissions were not confined to America. 
   Promoted stories   
""It is unacceptable that the Government waited this long to take action."" 
 
Greenpeace published figures which it claimed show manufacturers of diesel vehicles built to comply with European emissions standards spent up to £13.6 million lobbying EU politicians last year. 
 
Its UK executive director, John Sauven, said: ""It's time for our ministers to be completely transparent on what they knew and when about the pollution fix scandal. 
 
""Many people will want to know which matters more to our Government - the polluters' profits or the health of their citizens."" 
 
A DfT spokesman said the UK Government has been ""at the forefront of action at a European level"" to introduce updated emissions testing. 
 
He added that the ICCT report published in October last year ""did not identify the vehicles tested"". 
 
VW has admitted that 11 million vehicles worldwide were fitted with sophisticated software which conned testers in the US into believing their vehicles met environmental standards. 
 
The Environmental Protection Agency said 482,000 of the German car-maker's 2009-15 models in the US were fitted with the defeat device to switch engines to a cleaner mode when they are undergoing official emissions testing. 
 
Once on the road, the cars produced nitrogen oxide pollutants at up to 40 times the legal standard. 
 
VW has not revealed whether cars in the UK are affected but Germany's transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said 2.8 million vehicles in his country have the software. 
 
He added that VW vans as well as cars are caught up in the scandal. 
 
Mr McLoughlin said on Thursday that the Government was taking the ''unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously''. 
 
He announced that the UK regulator would investigate and re-run laboratory tests and called on the EU to conduct a Europe-wide investigation to find out if cars have been fitted with defeat devices on the continent. 
 
The British Lung Foundation urged the Government to commit to ""routine, independent real-world testing on all cars"". 
 
Mr Winterkorn resigned over the scandal but insisted he was not aware of ""any wrongdoing on my part''. 
 
According to reports the 68-year-old could receive a severance package of up to two years of his annual salary, which would be worth over £22 million. 
 
Mr Mueller's appointment as his replacement was announced after the stock markets had closed so it is not possible to say exactly how investors will take the news, though it is fair to say his appointment was widely expected. 
 
Volkswagen shares fell 4.3% to 108 euros (£80) today, meaning the carmaker has lost about a third of its value, or 26 billion euros (£19 billion), since the start of the crisis. 
 
The Volkswagen board is also expected to dismiss high-level engineers and designers, though no further details have been released yet. 
 
Mr Mueller, 62, formerly worked as VW's head product strategist, and is understood to have substantial backing among the company's 20-member supervisory board. 
 
Analysts said his first tasks at VW will be to clean out its senior management team, restructure costs and drive sales. 
 
Mr Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying IT has worked for various parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors for the top job. 
 
Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW.

He has until recently joked that he was too old to run VW, which is the largest carmaker in the world by sales. 
 
Under his leadership, Porsche has successfully added new models and is expected to boost sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early.. ‘Imperturbable’ Porsche chief takes wheel at Volkswagen. by Simon Morgan

Frankfurt (AFP) | 25 September 2015 19:17 

That quality might serve the 62-year-old well as he takes charge of the carmaker now mired in its deepest crisis ever over a massive emissions test scam. 

“We will overcome this crisis,” vowed the white-haired and blue-eyed manager, a trained tool maker and IT expert, pledging to “restore confidence… through an unsparing investigation and maximum transparency.”

Mueller, born in the former communist East Germany, had already been tipped to take over VW during a bitter leadership struggle earlier this year between outgoing CEO Martin Winterkorn and his one-time mentor and former supervisory board chief Ferdinand Piech.

It was Winterkorn who eventually won that battle, only to fall this week over the pollution cheating revelations, the biggest scandal ever to hit VW.

The careers of Mueller and Winterkorn are closely interlinked.

They already worked together at VW’s top-line brand, Audi, in Ingolstadt in Bavaria, where Mueller began his career; Winterkorn was appointed chief in 2002.

At roughly the same time Winterkorn was appointed CEO of the entire VW group in 2007, meantime, Mueller went to Wolfsburg, too, where he took charge of the projects department. He was subsequently made a general representative of the group. 

– Football fan –

Born on June 9, 1953, in Limbach-Oberfrohna in what is now the eastern part of reunited Germany, Mueller fled communism to the neighbouring West German regional state of Bavaria with his parents. 

He has told the daily Die Welt that he originally wanted to become a professional football player.

He is still a keen soccer fan and supporter of FC Bayern and Stuttgarter Kickers, according to the mass-circulation daily Bild.

But in the end, Mueller trained as a tool maker at Audi and went on to study information technology in Munich. 

According to Die Welt, Mueller is a man “who loves cars and who loves people who love cars.” 

His first car was a VW Beetle and he now owns an Audi TT and Porsche 911, according to Bild. He also occasionally likes to go for a jaunt in the legendary Porsche 550 Spyder sports car that he borrows from Porsche’s own museum.

Die Welt dubbed him “The Imperturbable,” saying he was someone who knows how to use his elbows. 

“But I don’t see it as playing foul, rather as a sign of perseverance and mettle,” the newspaper quoted Mueller as saying. 

Uwe Hueck, head of Porsche’s works committee, said Mueller “has the whiff of Porsche about him. His engine is seated lower and he has wide tyres.”

Mueller — who tends to lapse into a strong Bavarian dialect when not on duty — was appointed CEO at Porsche in 2010, not long after VW had emerged victorious in its tortuous takeover battle with Porsche.

As far back as 2005, Porsche hatched an audacious plan to take control of VW, which was 15 times larger than Porsche.

But the plan ran out of steam a result of the financial crisis and failed to win enough support from VW’s shareholders. This led to VW turning the tables on Porsche and taking over the sports car maker.

As Porsche CEO, Mueller also sits on Volkswagen’s management board. 

In March this year, he was able to present record annual sales, turnover and profit for the sports car maker. 

“Porsche has come along very successfully and is now in better shape than ever before,” he beamed. 

– Management style –

In a recent interview with the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Mueller noted the difference in the corporate cultures of both companies. 

Porsche was “almost like a family company with 20,000 employees,” while VW in Wolfsburg “was in charge of 600,000 people around the world,” he said.

Different management styles were therefore needed. 

“Just because something works here with us in Stuttgart, that doesn’t mean to say it will function in Wolfsburg,” Mueller said.

He saw himself as an “approachable team-player,” who tried “to push through his decisions in a collegial and harmonious way.” 

But Mueller added that he could also be “pretty forceful. I don’t like it when things are talked to death.”

In the public debate about the massive influx of refugees into Germany, Mueller takes a very clear stance. 

“We have to oppose and stand up to extremism,” he told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 

“People from 56 different countries work at Porsche. I don’t think I need to say any more.” 

It was high time that “industry bosses made their opinions known about certain issues,” he said.

Now that Mueller has taken over from Winterkorn at the helm of VW, one of Germany’s biggest companies, his words are likely to carry even more clout.

© 2015 AFP. New Volkswagen CEO Vows To Win Back Trust. Volkswagen has named Porsche chief Matthias Mueller as its new boss as the German car-maker deals with an emissions scandal.

Mr Mueller replaces Martin Winterkorn, who resigned this week after it was revealed VW had fitted millions of cars and vans with software which allowed them to falsely pass emissions tests.

The new CEO said that his priority is win back the trust that has been lost in the company after the scandal.

""Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do all it can to develop and implement the strictest compliance and governance standards in the whole industry,"" he vowed.

Mr Mueller said the company had a chance to emerge stronger from the crisis.

Porsche is owned by VW, and Mr Mueller, 62, has worked for parts of the group for almost four decades.

More follows.... TechArt Upgrades Porsche Cayenne Turbo to 700hp. Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter German tuning specialist TechArt has showcased its new powerkit for the Porsche Cayenne Turbo. Combining both performance and endurance, it will increase the power of the vehicle’s 4.8-liter turbocharged engine to 700 hp and torque to 920 Nm. The stock Cayenne Turbo generates 520 hp and 750 Nm of torque. Furthermore, the top speed will now be electronically limited to 300 km\/h in combination with 21-inch standard wheels and tyres. TechArt’s Techtronic system interacts with the engine to intelligently activate additional power resources. The system ensures optimum performance at all speeds and provides a well-balanced torque curve. In the Cayenne Turbo, the Techtronic coordinates the interaction between the standard engine control unit and the new TechArt components, which include exhaust manifolds and turbochargers. There are also the TechArt oil and water pipes and the sport air filters. That said, power delivery is regulated in two stages. During normal operation, 640 hp is available, but if one activates the Sport mode 700 hp becomes accessible between 5400 and 6000 rpm. The performance tweak means that the TechArt-tuned Cayenne Turbo covers 0 to 100 km\/h in 3.9 seconds, 0.5 seconds faster than the production model. The 200 km\/h barrier is crossed in 13.8 seconds. Despite these figures, the company claims that there’s been an increase in fuel consumption of less than 1 per cent and the CO2 emissions are only 0.8 per cent higher than the values of the measured series model. The powerkit, TA058\/T2, costs €29,155 and will be an option on the TechArt Magnum bodykit for the current generation Cayenne Turbo.

Volkswagen diesel scandal: Why it's so much worse than it looks for VW. The headlines look bad for VW. But the numbers look a whole lot worse. 

VW names Matthias Mueller as CEO Pretend you are a director of VW at yet another emergency board meeting. Over the weekend, Switzerland has announced a ban on the sale of all VW's, affecting 180,000 unsold cars and trucks.

That doesn't really even seem to matter, since your company has already suspended US and European sales of the mainstay of its range, the 2.0 litre TDI diesel. Last year VW sold 2.44 million diesel cars, or 25 per cent of its total output (including petrol and electric).

But as serious as the diesel problem is, the main game here is so much larger, for two reasons.

First, it's not just a question about VW's diesel, but whether the diesel engine itself has a commercial future. Or is this the moment the global auto industry uses to do a hard reboot and shift to electric, greenlighting the electric car for the mainstream? We'll get to that in a minute.

First, the board meeting. VW is a family of brands – Skoda, Audi, SEAT, Bentley (the 4WD turbo diesel Bentley Bentayga is already set for release this year) and even Porsche. (Yes, Porsche. It sells a diesel 4WD the engine for which may have come from VW.)

Did I mention that Porsche also owns 30 per cent of the voting equity of VW? In fact, there are two Porsche family representatives just across the VW board table. They look very uncomfortable. What now?

Forget the recriminations, and who knew what when, and assume the sackings, fines and custodial sentences are a given. The central question you are gathered around to answer is: what now?

As a board member, you will hear argument that the company must continue with the diesel, because the shareholders (including the director, seated to your left, representing the government of the German state of Lower Saxony, which has a 20 per cent voting interest) are demanding their dividend, which they use for public works including schools and hospitals. The Porsche family may be agreeing, although it could just be the light.

At the same time you will be aware of tens of thousands of workers and their families who are facing financial losses in part from possibility of job cuts, and second from the fall in the value of VW stock.

You all agree that pressing on with diesel is the best course of action. The question is how?

The balance sheet shows VW has around €351 billion ($560 billion) in total assets deployed around the world, manufacturing, assembling, distributing, maintaining and financing cars.

Of that, VW has €44 billion ($70.1 billion) in property plant and equipment. You will have to decide how much of this to write off and then put a number to what will be a multi-billion Euro amount to re-tool the asset base to bring diesel up to the lied-about specification, or at least to that of other diesel car makers. Sales slump

For the next couple of years, you will have to get used to sales which could be 75 per cent of what they were. Profit structures being what they are, this could cut earnings by more than half, before the write-offs, which will run for years.

One very important issue will be whether the other makers have been cheating as well. If they haven't then VW could copy their technology and compete head to head.

But if the others manufacturers have been cheating – and remember this is a distinct possibility given that the problem has been going on for ten years – then the cheating could be industry wide.

It is here the current thinking on diesel needs to be factored in.

There have been a rash of serious complaints in Europe and the US about diesel in the past few years – for example Kings College London is claiming 5800 premature deaths from emissions, while the US is claiming 10 times that figure.

All this time the electric car will be gaining traction. By which is meant charging stations, the global re-think about what a car needs to be (who needs 500 kilometre range when most trips are to the shops?) carbon pricing and of course China, the car industry for which is going global and electric as fast as it can.

Meanwhile the value of Tesla, at $US33 billion ($47 billion), is already more than half that of VW and it only sells 1 per cent of the cars. Why bother retooling for diesel to arrive at the same time the electric car has gone mainstream, either by government degree (because of emissions) or consumer taste. Significant liability

And now we get to the second issue. Buried in the VW accounts is a finance book with €135 billion in liabilities. The assets backing these liabilities will be pretty much entirely vehicles, the value of which has just fallen very significantly. (If you bought a VW diesel yesterday, you are already looking at a much larger drop to resale value than you bargained for. Multiply that out and it's a hefty class action).

So as well as a car maker, VW is also virtually a bank, requiring a portion of its book to be written off too. There may be questions about bail-outs. It is a dead certainty that Angela Merkel will soon be addressing the board in her official capacity. This just keeps getting worse.

Alex Pollak is CEO of Loftus Peak, a fund manager that specialises in building listed global portfolios for self-managed super funds. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.. Tesla Struggles in Germany With Buyers Unswayed by Model S Cult. Tesla Motors Inc. has built a cult following in the U.S. for its high-powered electric sports cars. In Europe’s biggest car market, consumers are proving harder to convince. 

Just 958 of Tesla’s 81,800-euro ($92,000) Model S, its only vehicle, sold in Germany in the eight months through August, according to data from motor vehicle office KBA. That’s a fraction of the 5,149 deliveries for the comparatively expensive Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan. German e-mobility pioneer BMW’s i3 electric city car also outsold the Model S by more than 30 percent. 

Tesla’s competition is clear at this week’s International Motor Show in Frankfurt, where its upcoming Model X sport utility vehicle is notably absent. Audi presented its zero-emission E-tron Quattro concept SUV, Porsche promised an electric sports car within five years and BMW AG said more green “i” models are on the way. After individual successes in the Netherlands and Norway, Tesla and its celebrity chief executive officer, billionaire  Elon Musk, must challenge all three German brands to cement its position in Europe as a whole. 

“It’s not enough to be successful in Norway; you have to be successful in the big markets,” said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. “If you make it in Germany, you can make it everywhere.” 
Long-Term Goal 
On Tuesday, Tesla’s booth was quiet compared to the pumping music and chattering crowds at the German carmakers’ pavilions. A few visitors circulated among three Model S cars in red, white and blue. (For more news on the Frankfurt show, see SHOW.) 

The U.S. automaker said the moves by its rivals will help it in the long run. 

“For us to achieve our long-term goal, which is to get people driving 
electric vehicles, we need the cooperation of traditional carmakers,” said Ricardo Reyes, Tesla’s spokesman. “When you hear companies like Porsche or BMW make very public commitments to this, it’s a vindication of what we’re trying to do.” 

Still, those efforts face challenges as German consumers tend to be slow to adopt new products and may be more willing to trust domestic brands. In addition to that, Tesla hasn’t filled the vacant position of European sales chief, Reyes said. The company also has no plans to expand its German network of fast battery-charging stations. 
Small Niche 
Tesla delivered about 7,100 vehicles in Europe and 11,700 in the U.S. in the first half of this year, according to estimates from market researcher IHS Automotive. The company doesn’t release regional sales figures. Its home state of California accounted for nearly half the U.S. total, according to the California New Car Dealers Association . 

“This is a product and a kind of marketing that best fits the United States,” said Bernard Jullien, director at the Paris-based automotive think tank Gerpisa. “The niche is even smaller for Tesla on the continent.” 

It may take years before Tesla gains a strong foothold in Europe, said Carlos da Silva, an analyst for IHS. The Model X, which will start deliveries this fall, won’t change that, he said, because the SUV will still be too big and expensive to appeal to a broad range of customers. The Signature series, a limited-edition version that hundreds have reserved, starts at $132,000. 

The real growth for Tesla may come with the Model 3, a smaller car that Musk has said will cost about $30,000 to $35,000, Da Silva said. 
Norwegian Boom 
Tesla said in August that its first-half European sales increased by more than 50 percent. Much of that boost comes from Norway, where generous subsidies and perks including free parking, charging and driving on bus lanes have almost tripled the number of electric passenger cars on the road since 2013 to some 50,000. 

The Model S was the country’s second-best-selling electric car after Volkswagen AG’s e-Golf in the first half, with 2,674 deliveries, according to website EV Obsession . 

The Norwegian boom may not last forever. The government has said it will gradually start cutting incentives in 2018. No other European country offers such generous bonuses . 

To succeed across the region, Tesla will have to persuade more buyers like Jerome Benoit, the 32-year-old CEO of French manufacturer Delta Plus. Benoit traded in a BMW 3-Series for a Tesla S 85 in 2013, partly because the electric car gave him the feeling of being at the forefront of the auto industry, a position the German brands have traditionally claimed. 

“I’m pretty sure my father wouldn’t have chosen it, as it’s so high-tech and different from the usual luxury sedans,” Benoit said..

Cost of deceiving customers mounts for VW. The Volkswagon emissions manipulation scandal is being called the auto industry's LIBOR moment – when a series of banks systemically manipulated interest rates.

It could also be likened to BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill – given it has environmental implications.

All have cost the balance sheets of the companies involved billions, and all have long tails.

So potentially serious are the financial implications for VW that there are now concerns that it could even provide a big hit to the German economy. 

The parallels with LIBOR are more evident because they both involve rigging and for a lengthy period.

These were not victimless crimes just well hidden by the perpetrators. For example, the actions of the banks involved in the manipulation of the LIBOR interest rate ultimately added to the cost of borrowing for unsuspecting consumers.

Only last month nine banks paid a total of $US9 billion to investors in the United States over claims they rigged foreign exchange markets, and their lawyers hope to launch similar lawsuits in London. This is in addition to billions already paid in fines.

Unlike the horde of marketing experts that suggests the potential for VW's financial disaster could ultimately come from the damage to its brand, it is more likely to result from relentless and costly class actions that drain more cash than regulatory fines, which some have estimated could be as high as $US18 billion from the US alone.

Brand damage will play into the ultimate cost but at this stage it is near impossible to assess.

At this stage the sharemarket, which has seen the company's share price fall by a third, is not factoring in that fines will reach the $US18 billion mark.

But where this number lands depends on how geographically widespread the deceit extends.

For the time being VW has set aside €6.5 billion to cover the financial fallout that will include fines and recalls, but history shows this will probably fall well short of the mark.

In the litigation-hungry US market, investors in VW will be itching to recover some the $US30 billion fall in value the stock has suffered when the scandal broke.

In the meantime, VW seemed to be following the damage control public relations rule book by having the chairman and the chief executive fall on their swords – after a full mea culpa.

""The board of management at Volkswagen AG takes these findings very seriously. I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,"" said chief executive Martin Winterkorn.

But this show of repentance took a nasty turn on Thursday when it was revealed that Winterkorn would be eligible for his $US32 million pension and potentially millions more in benefits. Last year he was Germany's highest-paid chief executive.

It certainly doesn't suggest that top management it being punished for the company's deplorable behaviour.

It is an attitude that reflects complete disdain for corporate governance – but one that doesn't come as a complete surprise given its form in this regard has previously been called out.

Ratings agency Fitch noted in a report this week on VW that it considers ""VW's corporate governance as weaker than that of its main peers"".

Key areas of weakness include the 20 per cent blocking minority in voting resolutions, conflicts of interest on the part of some board members including between Porsche and Volkswagen, and lack of independence and diversity at the supervisory board level.

The latest emission test crisis is another illustration of inconsistent management control in some areas.

These sentiments were clearly not echoed by the company's board, which stated in its latest annual report (which predates the emissions scandal) that ""transparent and responsible corporate governance takes the highest priority in our daily work. We regard it as one of the key conditions for strengthening the trust of our customers and investors, continually increasing the company's value and securing the future of the Volkswagen Group"".

However, VW does note (albeit in smaller print) that, based on the wording of the German Corporate Governance Code, it is unclear whether the Audit Committee chairman is ""independent"".

Corporate advisory groups have declared VW as having the worst corporate governance among its German peers, and it has been under attack by various shareholder groups over lack of board independence.

This brings into question what more might be uncovered when investigators trawl through the company.

This makes investing in VW something of a crapshoot. The fall in the share price and thus the value of the company might be enough to cover all financial contingencies. But it is much too early in the game to make that call.

If the brand is sufficiently knocked around and sales take a beating, there is no telling how costly the long-term damage could be.

At this point VW has a solid balance sheet.

Fitch has placed the company's rating on a negative watch in response to the events of the past week. ""Fitch expects profitability to be hit by the emission test crisis,"" it said. ""Fitch previously expected operating margins to rebound to approximately 6.5 per cent in 2016 but we will reassess our assumptions as events unfold."".

Yellen said she expects inflation will return to 2% over the next few years as temporary factors currently holding it down will wane. Signs of weak growth overseas won’t prove large enough to have a significant impact on policy. Yellen said: “Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate…an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter.” 
 
Near the end of her speech, Yellen kind of froze up; she went silent for a while, stumbled over her words, and seemed to be having a hard time. After the speech paramedics checked her out and gave her a clean bill of health. Later attributed the incident to dehydration. She was back at work today. 
 
Friday morning we heard reports House Speaker John Boehner would resign his position as Speaker of the House and his seat in Congress at the end of October. Boehner held a press conference to confirm. The abrupt decision comes after he faced heavy pressure from conservatives in his party to take a harder line on their causes. Boehner also told the lawmakers that Pope Francis ’ visit to Congress the day before was a crystallizing moment. 
 
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 House Republican, quickly became the leading contender to replace Boehner as speaker. McCarthy has been loyal to Boehner during his frequent tussles with conservatives, but is also close to Tea Party conservatives and in recent months has tacked to the right. Boehner declined to endorse anyone as his successor, but told reporters McCarthy “would make an excellent speaker.” 
 
Boehner told reporters he was stepping aside to avoid another brewing House battle over his leadership, but before he leaves, Boehner will have at least one big battle. With only a few days left until a possible government shutdown , Congress is in overdrive to keep federal funds flowing despite partisan divisions over Planned Parenthood. The issue has ignited the latest crisis in U.S. budget wars and has forced the Obama administration to prepare for a potential repeat of the 2013 shutdown, which lasted 16 days and suspended the salaries of 800,000 federal employees. Boehner’s resignation appeared to ease the threat of a government shutdown next week. Many Republicans said it would free him to forge ahead with a “clean” spending bill. At least that’s one theory; the other line of thought is that Boehner will find it increasingly difficult to herd cats as a lame duck. I’m sure he’ll make a fine lobbyist. 
 
Next on the news docket:  Chinese president Xi Jingping is in Washington for an official state dinner at the White House. President Xi announced that China will start a national pollution-trading system to cut global-warming emissions for its most polluting industries. That’s in addition to previous Chinese commitments to bring its emissions to a peak by 2030 and radically scale up solar and wind power. China even promised $3.1 billion to help poorer countries move away from fossil fuels. The move should also add pressure for a global climate change accord in Paris this December. At a joint news conference with President Obama, Xi said there was no reason to expect China’s yuan currency to depreciate against the U.S. dollar over the long run, saying the exchange rate was “moving toward stability.” 
 
Pope Francis was in New York on Friday . He started the day with a speech before the United Nations General Assembly. Pope Francis strongly condemned the craving for material gains and power, telling world leaders gathered at the United Nations that greed is destroying the Earth’s resources and aggravating poverty. The spiritual leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics condemned the “grave offense” of economic and social exclusion. An attack on the environment was an assault on the rights and living conditions of the most vulnerable, he said, warning that at its most extreme, environmental degradation threatened humanity’s survival. Then he led multi-religious prayer services at the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum site, followed by a ride through Central Park in the Popemobile, a visit to a school in Harlem, and then a mass at Madison Square Garden. And you thought you had a busy Friday. 
 
Gross domestic product — the value of everything a nation produces — rose at a 3.9% annual rate from April to June, according to the government’s second update of how fast the nation’s economy expanded during the spring. Previously the Commerce Department had said GDP increased 3.7%. The figures get revised as the government gets more data on how the economy performed. Consumer purchases jumped 3.6%, up from a prior estimate of 3.1%. Americans spent more on services such as health care and transportation. Businesses also invested more in structures such as office buildings and plants than the government initially reported. Investment on structures rose 6.2%, double the earlier estimate. Outlays on equipment also rose slightly instead of declining. And spending for home construction climbed 9.3% instead of 7.8%. After-tax corporate profits jumped 2.6 percent to double BEA’s estimate of 1.3 percent. 
 
S&P 500 companies , excluding financial companies, collectively had $1.43 trillion in cash reserves sitting on the sidelines in the second quarter (April to June) of this year. That’s the second highest level in 10 years, and just a tad lower than the 1.45 trillion high set in the fourth quarter last year. Tech companies especially have much more cash than they did during the dot-com bubble era. Tech leads all sectors in its cash holdings by a long mile. 
 
Some cash numbers are remarkable. Microsoft ( MSFT ) has $96 billion in cash, Google ( GOOG ) holds $70 billion and Cisco ( CSCO ) has $60 billion. The good news is that it reflects very healthy balance sheets. The bad news is that it shows a reluctance to spend by corporate executives, which signals pessimism and that they aren’t seeing enough growth opportunities to invest in.

The Brazilian real enjoyed a massive rally on Thursday after the governor of Brazil’s central bank vowed to use “all instruments” available to policymakers to stem the currency’s recent slide. Busting a five-day losing streak, the real rallied as much as 7% intraday, its biggest gain since November 2008. On Wednesday, the bank announced plans to auction $2 billion worth of currency swaps over two days – restarting a program that was scrapped earlier this year. for the first time since April 2013 in a symbolic setback to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic stimulus. Core inflation, excluding fresh food, was down by 0.1% compared with a year ago in August, as slumping global energy prices outweighed headline prices. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda continues to insist Japan can reach a 2% inflation target by the middle of next year, but most analysts think that goal is now out of reach. 
 
Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) has a new CEO, Matthias Mueller, head of the company’s Porsche brand. Volkswagen has blamed its emissions scandal on a “small group” of people and said suspended a number of staff. Müller pledged to leave “no stone unturned” and “maximum transparency” in an investigation into how the company cheated emissions tests on diesel cars. However, the new VW boss did not reveal how many staff have been suspended or who they are. Bloomberg reported that key parts of the faked emissions tests had been overseen by VW executives based in the company’s headquarters in Wolfsburg.

Shoppers who purchase the devices in an Apple ( AAPL ) store can opt in to the new iPhone Upgrade Program, which includes Apple’s warranty plan and the option to upgrade to a new handset every year. Analysts expect 12 million to 13 million phones to fly off the shelves over the weekend, up from more than 10 million last year – when the iPhone 6’s launch was delayed in China. 
 
Google is back under U.S. antitrust scrutiny as officials ask whether the tech giant stifled competitors’ access to its Android mobile-operating system. The Federal Trade Commission reached an agreement with the Justice Department to spearhead an investigation of Google’s Android business.

The new device is 22% lighter and will work with all of Samsung’s 2015 line of smartphones, in contrast to the highly anticipated Oculus Rift, which will need to be wired to an expensive gaming computer. Users will additionally be able to cast 360-degree videos from Facebook’s ( FB ) newsfeed into the Gear VR, and Netflix, Vimeo and Hulu support is also on the way. 
 
A rare astronomical phenomenon Sunday night will produce a moon that will appear slightly bigger than usual and have a reddish hue, an event known as a super blood moon. It hasn’t happened since 1982, and won’t happen again until 2033. A so-called supermoon , which occurs when the moon is closest to earth in its orbit, will coincide with a lunar eclipse, leaving the moon in Earth’s shadow. Individually, the two phenomena are not uncommon, but they do not align often. The moon may appear 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter, but the difference is subtle to the plain eye. But the reddish tint from the lunar eclipse is likely to be visible throughout much of North America. You’re basically seeing all of the sunrises and sunsets across the world, all at once, being reflected off the surface of the moon.. Porsche 918 Spyder Rendered With RWB Bodykit. Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Rauh-Welt Begriff (RWB) tuned Porsche 911s are amongst the most outlandish and ridiculous cars anywhere in the world. The tuning firm’s widebody kits for the 911 are world-famous and can be found on all corners of the globe. While RWB only offers its widebody package for old Porsche 911 models, rendering artist Khyzyl Saleem has rendered how a potential Porsche 918 Spyder outfitted with a bodykit from the company could look. As you’d expect, it features massively flared rear wheel arches supporting exceptionally wide wheels and tyres. It also includes extended side skirts as well as a completely redesigned front fascia. The new front-end includes aggressive canards, matte black headlights as well as a new lip spoiler extending down towards the ground. While RWB offers truly insane rear wings for the 911, Saleem hasn’t rendered the following 918 with such a wing. Even without that feature, it looks out-of-this-world.

VW has named a new CEO. Volkswagen has named Matthias Müller as its new CEO. 
 
The 62-year-old Müller was CEO of Porsche, which is among VW Group’s brands. Müller’s appointment comes as VW reels from an emissions-cheating scandal that has affected 11 million vehicles worldwide. 
 
The VW supervisory board met Friday to vote on Müller’s candidacy. Made up of members of VW Group management, labour leaders, representatives of the Porsche family, and the government of Lower Saxony, where VW is headquartered, the supervisory board has moved swiftly to deal with the scandal since the news broke last week. 
 
Former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who has survived a management crisis earlier this year, resigned on Tuesday. 
 
Müller has been with the VW Group for decades. He began his career in the German auto industry in the 1970s, as an apprentice before going to college, and then rose through the ranks. He has presided over Porsche transformation from a maker of expensive sports cars to a company that sells luxury SUV and sedans in both the developed and developing world. 
 
Müller also has the support of former VW chairman Ferdinand Piëch, who was ousted from the VW board earlier this year, but continues to exert influence. During VW’s management crisis, Müller was suggested as a CEO to replace Winterkorn, who was under fire for VW’s weak performance in the US and its sprawling worldwide growth. 
 
Various media reports has also noted that Müller was supported by both the Porsche family (of which Piëch is a member) and VW’s powerful labour unions. 
 
Follow Business Insider Australia on. VW scandal: German prosecutors launch inquiry into former boss. The crisis enveloping Volkswagen has intensified as German prosecutors opened an investigation of the former boss of the world’s biggest carmaker, Martin Winterkorn, over the emissions scandal. 
 
As a senior German politician expressed concerns about the effects on the wider economy, Winterkorn became the subject of a preliminary inquiry by prosecutors in Braunschweig into possible fraud relating to the sale of vehicles with manipulated emissions data. 
 
Braunschweig is a town close to Wolfsburg, the home of VW. The carmaker has been rocked by the scandal , which erupted 10 days ago when a US government agency revealed that it had discovered VW had been using sophisticated software to cheat emissions tests. 

 
Since then shares in VW, a lynchpin of the Germany economy, have been in freefall. They are now down 40% since the US Environmental Protection Agency accused the carmaker of installing a “defeat device”, which reduced nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions under test conditions. 
 
 Related: If this scandal goes beyond VW, the wheels will come off an entire industry  
 
The latest slump in the shares – they lost 7.5% on Monday – came after VW provided more detail about the 11m cars caught up in dodging the emission tests. Some 2.1m are Audis – A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models – and 1.2m are Skodas. 
 
Car owners in the UK are still awaiting information about how many of the affected vehicles were sold here. Lawyers in the UK and other countries said there was likely to be an avalanche of claims when it becomes clear where the cars fitted with the defeat devices were sold. 
 
The company refused to comment on reports that three senior executives – Heinz-Jakob Neusser, head of brand development at VW, Ulrich Hackenberg, head of research and development at Audi, and Wolfgang Hatz, R&D chief at Porsche – had been suspended. It also refused to confirm reports that one of the biggest US law firms, Jones Day, was being lined up to lead an internal investigation. 
 
Reuters has reported that Hackenberg is taking legal action. 

 
Winterkorn was named in a statement issued by the German prosecutors, who said he was being investigated over “allegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data”. The prosecutors said they were trying to establish who was responsible for the installation of the defeat devices. In Germany prosecutors are obliged to investigate allegations and in this case it is understood charges have been filed by about 10 individuals. 
 
Winterkorn, one of the highest paid bosses in Germany, could not be reached for further comment. But when he quit last Wednesday – just 48 hours before he had been expected to be confirmed in the top job for another five years – he insisted that he was not responsible for the scandal gripping the business he has run since 2007. 
 
“Above all, I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group. I am doing this [resigning] in the interests of the company even though I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part,” he said last week.

His r eplacement, Matthias Müller, who was head of Porsche, which is owned by VW – is now scrambling to repair the company’s reputation. According to a letter seen by Reuters, he told staff: “VW is in a dramatic situation. It will be far from easy to restore the reputation of the company and win back trust from customers.” 
 
The company has set aside €6.5bn (£4.8bn) to cover the costs of the scandal, but analysts expect the final total to be much higher given that fines levied in the US alone could reach $18bn (£12bn). 
 
Germany’s deputy finance minister, Jens Spahn, said the wider Germany economy could also be hit by the scandal. “The car industry is crucial for the German economy,” he told a conference. “ It [the scandal] can have a big impact on the German economy. This should worry us a little.” 
 
Vehicle products make up 17% of German industrial output, according to economists at Capital Economics, while the automotive industry accounts for almost 5% of overall economic output. Economists calculate that if industries with ties to vehicle manufacturing are included, as many as 15% of German jobs may be reliant on the industry in some way. However, they have played down the long-term impact of the scandal on the economy. 
 
The company is also facing protests from investors at its annual meeting next month. Hans-Christoph Hirt, a director at the advisers Hermes EOS, which represents about 40 investors, intends to raise questions about the make-up of the board and call for changes to corporate culture. 
 
“ The supervisory board’s choice of corporate insiders as CEO and chair-elect also raises some real doubts whether the key shareholders have recognised the need for fundamental reform and a real new beginning,” said Hirt. 

 
Hirt said he had been in contact with about six other major carmakers to seek clarity on whether they were being drawn into the emissions scandal. 



 
 . Paul Walker’s Daughter Suing Porsche For Wrongful Death in Tragic Car Crash. Meadow Walker, the 16-year-old daughter of Fast & Furious star Paul Walker, is suing automaker Porsche for wrongful death in the tragic accident that killed her father two years ago. 
 
The wrongful death lawsuit alleges that “multiple design flaws” in the Porsche Carrera GT caused the crash that claimed the life of Walker and his friend, Roger Rodas. In particular, the lawsuit claims “the vehicle lacked safety features that are found on well-designed racing cars or even Porsche’s least expensive road cars — features that could have prevented the accident or, at a minimum, allowed Paul Walker to survive the crash.” Furthermore, the lawsuit goes on to state that Porsche used “side door reinforcement bars that lacked adequate welds and consisted of material weaker in strength than what is used in popular mass-market cars… designed and built to be operated at speeds much slower than the Carrera GT.” 
 
Of course, a savvy defense lawyer might argue that Walker and Rodas driving 90 mph in a 45 mph zone had more to do with the tragic crash than design flaws. Hell, that’s exactly what a spokesperson for Porsche is arguing, releasing a statement that basically amounts to, Well…but it’s not our fault though. 
 
“We believe the authorities’ reports in this case clearly established that this tragic crash resulted from reckless driving and excessive speed.” 
  
Credit: Universal 
  
But not everyone believes it’s such a cut-and-dry case. 
 
“The bottom line is that the Porsche Carrera GT is a dangerous car. It doesn’t belong on the street,” said Meadow Walker’s attorney, Jeff Milam, in a statement. “And we shouldn’t be without Paul Walker or his friend, Roger Rodas.” 
 
Both sides have a case, particularly Porsche, in arguing that reckless driving caused the tragedy and not their car specifically. However, should it be proven that technical shortcomings of the car contributed in any way to the fiery crash, Porsche might find themselves out of a lot of money. No specifics have been revealed concerning how much, exactly, Meadow Walker is seeking in damages, but it’s not going to be chump change. 
 
What do you think? Is Porsche at fault? Is it even anybody’s fault? Or was this just a tragic accident? Sound off in the comments! 
 
And for more automotive news, read up about Audi and Volkswagen’s insane scandal, as the company admitted cheating on emissions tests!. VW needs more than just a new CEO. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own. 
 
Martin Winterkorn should no longer be chief executive at Volkswagen. The boss of the German carmaker has presided over an emissions-cheating scandal that wiped a third off the German carmaker’s market value in just two days. But even his removal – which VW denied was imminent on Sept. 22 – would only be the start of a fundamental makeover. The group’s structure is too complex, and its corporate governance dysfunctional. 
 
VW’s systematic hoodwinking of U.S. authorities, selling cars equipped with devices that mask emissions during regulatory tests since 2009, is not the company’s only problem. The provision VW has announced of 6.5 billion euros will erode earnings already suppressed by troubles at VW’s key passenger car brand, persistent underperformance in the U.S. car market and growing headaches in China, where VW lacks the affordable SUV’s customers want. 
 
It isn’t yet clear whether Winterkorn knew about the “defeat devices” in certain U.S. cars. Still, his handling of the situation is indefensible. U.S. regulators had started to investigate unusual emissions of certain models back in 2014. But it took Volkswagen until Sept. 3, 2015 to admit it had used the devices. The company stayed mum until after U.S. authorities made the misbehaviour public on Sept. 18 – even issuing a press release naming it the world’s most sustainable carmaker. Winterkorn either didn’t know about the scandal that would destroy 25 billion euros of market capitalisation in two days, or thought shareholders wouldn’t want to know sooner. 
 
Even without Winterkorn, VW has a deep-running problem: the sheer complexity of an empire spanning across 12 brands from Ducati motor bikes to Golf family sedans, Porsche roadsters, Scania trucks and MAN ship engines. With over 592,000 employees and 119 factories in 31 countries, the giant looks ungovernable. Moreover, VW’s supervisory board is dominated by the Porsche-Piech family, regional politicians and German trade unions, making it too political to function effectively. 
 
The Wolfsburg-based carmaker ought to radically simplify itself. It could carve out its truck division and Porsche into independent businesses, since synergies with other activities are minimal. What’s left could be grouped into a premium division under Audi and a volume division around VW. More broadly, Wolfsburg basically needs to scrap Winterkorn’s grandiose vision of becoming the world’s “number one mobility enabler.” And executing this turnaround needs someone else at the top.. VW diesel scandal: the company has a new chief executive officer. The diesel emissions rigging disaster has seen a hard week for the world’s largest (interim) automaker by sales, Volkswagen AG, which saw its CEO Martin Winterkorn leave his post for Matthias Mueller to occupy.

…  
Mueller is a VW AG insider and company veteran, previously charged with leading the successful Porsche division – the sports car manufacturer has the best earnings margin in the industry – and has now come to helm the group that spans everything from motorcycles to big trucks amid a scandal described by the chairman as a “moral and political disaster”. The 62-year-old Mueller was presented as the new chief executive officer during a news conference at company headquarters in Wolfsburg on Friday, commenting that his first order of business is to endure the fallout from the emissions cheating – which led to long-time CEO Martin Winterkorn resigning earlier last week and the stock taking a massive dive. 

Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do all it can to develop and implement the strictest compliance and governance standards in the whole industry,” commented Mueller. 

Acting chairman Berthold Huber also took the time to apologize to “our customers, the public, authorities and investors” and called the time …. UK ministers 'must come clean' over when they knew of VW scandal. UK ministers have been told to ""come clean"" on when they were first told about the Volkswagen scandal. 
 
Labour's shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood claimed the response of the Department for Transport (DfT) was ""unacceptable"". 
 
Meanwhile the car company announced Matthias Mueller as its new chief executive.  The former Porsche boss replaces Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down in the wake of the scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. 
 
Environmental group Greenpeace wrote to the Government to ask if it knew about the cheating of emissions tests before this month. 
 
The action against Volkswagen in the US began with diesel emissions research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in 2013 and 2014 which found a huge discrepancy in real-world performance and official laboratory tests. 
 
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced yesterday that diesel cars would be re-tested in the UK. 
 
Ms Greenwood said: ""Ministers must come clean and admit when they were first told about the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
""The International Council on Clean Transportation, the body which helped to expose the problem, warned a year ago that dangerously high levels of nitrogen oxide emissions were not confined to America. 
 
""It is unacceptable that the Government waited this long to take action."" 
 
Greenpeace published figures which it claimed show manufacturers of diesel vehicles built to comply with European emissions standards spent up to £13.6 million lobbying EU politicians last year. 
 
Its UK executive director, John Sauven, said: ""It's time for our ministers to be completely transparent on what they knew and when about the pollution fix scandal. 
 
""Many people will want to know which matters more to our Government - the polluters' profits or the health of their citizens."" 
 
A DfT spokesman said the UK Government has been ""at the forefront of action at a European level"" to introduce updated emissions testing. 
 
He added that the ICCT report published in October last year ""did not identify the vehicles tested"". 
 
VW has admitted that 11 million vehicles worldwide were fitted with sophisticated software which conned testers in the US into believing their vehicles met environmental standards. 
 
The Environmental Protection Agency said 482,000 of the German car-maker's 2009-15 models in the US were fitted with the defeat device to switch engines to a cleaner mode when they are undergoing official emissions testing. 
 
Once on the road, the cars produced nitrogen oxide pollutants at up to 40 times the legal standard. 
 
VW has not revealed whether cars in the UK are affected but Germany's transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said 2.8 million vehicles in his country have the software. 
 
He added that VW vans as well as cars are caught up in the scandal. 
 
Mr McLoughlin said on Thursday that the Government was taking the ''unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously''. 
 
He announced that the UK regulator would investigate and re-run laboratory tests and called on the EU to conduct a Europe-wide investigation to find out if cars have been fitted with defeat devices on the continent. 
 
The British Lung Foundation urged the Government to commit to ""routine, independent real-world testing on all cars"". 
 
Mr Winterkorn resigned over the scandal but insisted he was not aware of ""any wrongdoing on my part''. 
 
According to reports the 68-year-old could receive a severance package of up to two years of his annual salary, which would be worth over £22 million. 
 
Mr Mueller's appointment as his replacement was announced after the stock markets had closed so it is not possible to say exactly how investors will take the news, though it is fair to say his appointment was widely expected. 
 
Volkswagen shares fell 4.3% to 108 euros (£80) today, meaning the carmaker has lost about a third of its value, or 26 billion euros (£19 billion), since the start of the crisis. 
 
The Volkswagen board is also expected to dismiss high-level engineers and designers, though no further details have been released yet. 
 
Mr Mueller, 62, formerly worked as VW's head product strategist, and is understood to have substantial backing among the company's 20-member supervisory board. 
 
Analysts said his first tasks at VW will be to clean out its senior management team, restructure costs and drive sales. 
 
Mr Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying IT has worked for various parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors for the top job. 
 
Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW. 
 
He  is known for his laid-back style, often appearing at car shows in a casual jumper rather than the expensively-tailored suits favoured by fellow executives. 
 
He has until recently joked that he was too old to run VW, which is the largest carmaker in the world by sales. 
 
Under his leadership, Porsche has successfully added new models and is expected to boost sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early.. Stocks Near Session Lows as Investors Seek Fed 'Clarity'. NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Stocks bottomed out at session lows by midday Thursday as investors eagerly awaited a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen after markets close.

Yellen will cap off the day with a speech at the University of Massachusetts at 5 p.m. Her comments will focus on ""inflation dynamics and monetary policy,"" both of which investors will be keen to scrutinize for clues as to when the first rate hike in nearly a decade might occur. 
 
""What I'm seeing is more skittishness about Fed action,"" Tim Dreiling, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve, told TheStreet on the day's big losses. Dreiling added that investors need more ""clarity"" on what the Fed intends to do before markets calm down from big swings.

Fred Upton of Michigan: ""It seems Volkswagen had a dirty little secret, and it's not just consumers who are feeling betrayed.""September 29, 2015 - 4:23 pm ET WASHINGTON (Bloomberg) -- U.S. lawmakers are demanding documents and a briefing from Volkswagen AG and the EPA as part of an investigation into the automaker’s admission that it cheated on emissions tests.The request by the House Energy and Commerce Committee follows an announcement last week that the panel will convene a hearing on revelations that VW rigged its 11 million diesel vehicles over seven years to evade emissions testing.The incident, which forced the resignation of the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker’s chief executive officer last week, is also being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department, the attorneys general of at least 27 states and German prosecutors.The House committee sent letters Tuesday asking the agency and carmaker for a timeline of events related to the company’s violations as well as communications between the two. The letters, signed by the top-ranking committee members of both parties, gave VW an Oct. 13 deadline to turn over the material and asked both entities to brief the committees staff by Friday.Committee Chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, said in a statement that “it seems Volkswagen had a dirty little secret, and it’s not just consumers who are feeling betrayed.”The letters ask for all “documents, including communications, relating to compliance with the Clean Air Act, EPA emissions standards and regulations, or testing of diesel emissions for all make and model year vehicles associated with the alleged violations.”“We must be sure that the EPA has the tools necessary to enforce these policies and also detect any fraud that may be occurring,” New Jersey Representative Frank Pallone Jr., the ranking Democrat, said in the committee’s press release.Contact Automotive News

Futures Surge On Renewed “Hopes” Of Fed Rate Hike, Sliding Yen. (Before It's News)  

Just one week after the Fed overwhelmingly voted to keep rates unchanged, in a move that was seen as a painfully dovish admission that neither the global nor the US economy are growing at anything close to a satisfactory pace, last night, in a very macabre speech which ended prematurely when a clearly unwell Yellen called it a day, the Fed Chair tried to once again lay out the case for a rate hike before year end. 
 
The market, which clearly ignored the glaring contradictions in Yellen’s speech which said that overseas events should not affect the Fed’s policy path just a week after the Fed statement admitted it is “monitoring developments abroad”, and also ignored Yellen explicit hint that NIRP is coming (only the size is unclear), and focused on the one thing it wanted to hear: a call to buy the all-critical USDJPY carry pair – because more dollar strength apparently is what the revenue and earnings recessioning S&P500 needs – which after trading around 120 in the past few days, had a 100 pip breakout overnight, hitting 121 just around 5am, in the process pushing US equity futures some 25 points higher at last check. 
 

 
So is that it? Has the confused market, after a 7-year liquidity addiction driven by an overly generous liquidity dealing Fed, decided to go cold turkey and accept that rate hikes are positive for risk? Hardly. But it will take the confused market the usual period of time before it realizes that Yellen’s deathwish on Emerging Market currencies is about to unleash havoc on global risk flows as we showed earlier this week . 
 

 
And if rate hikes are bullish, then why flirt with 25 bps – why not just do 2.5% or better yet, 5%, and send the E-mini limit up. 
 
Joking aside, another catalyst for the overnight surge in the S&P500 carry trade, the USDJPY, was Japan’s previously reported relapse into deflation for the first time since 2013, a clear indication that Abenomics is no longer working so, drumroll, more Abenomics is needed (i.e., more QE)! 
 
The CPI announcement was followed by a meeting between Kuroda and Abe earlier this morning. Some, like the Nikkei, suggested the meeting was to discuss future monetary policy and further easing, something we have said is in the cards now that the ECB is off the table indefinitely and leaves the BOJ as the only source of incremental “outside money” flows into risk… Even if such a QE boost means the BOJ monetizes outstanding Treasurys that much faster and is forced to taper QE prematurely. That doesn’t matter: what matters is preserving the status quo in a regime in which central bank credibility is suddenly crashing every single day. 
 
But back to markets, and where the aforementioned USDJPY did not take place until just before the European open, Asian equity markets traded mostly lower following Fed Chair Yellen’s less dovish than expected comments where she said she expects rate lift-off this year. Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) led the declines on continuation of Chinese growth concerns, while the ASX 200 (-0.6%) conformed to the negative tone led lower by energy and large banking names. 
 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 (+1.8%) fluctuated between gains and losses as strength in health care was offset by weakness in tech names, while Sharp (-8%) fell to record lows after it confirmed that it will miss its H1 profit forecast. JGBs initially tracked the losses in T notes post-Yellen comments but the better than prior enhanced liquidity auction added support. 
 
But if Asia limped along, European equity markets positive blasted off (Euro Stoxx: +3.0%) heading into the North American crossover, bolstered not only by the global Yen carry but also by stock specific news as German automakers see a rebound from recent losses after German press reported that there has been no suggestion of BMW exhaust manipulation despite contradictory reports yesterday. However it is worth noting that Euro Stoxx remains lower by around 1.5% for the week on the back of the ongoing emissions scandal. 
 
In FX, the final session of the week starts with USD dominating proceedings, with the greenback bolstered by comments last night from Fed’s Yellen (USD-index: +0.3%). Yellen’s comments yesterday were seen as less dovish than expected, whereby she said she expects rate lift-off this year – of course the Fed has been saying that for the past year. The real question is not if the Fed will hike rates in 2015 – it is when in 2016 Goldman will give the greenlight for a 2016 hike, if ever. 
 
For now, however, USD has continued to strengthen throughout the morning to weigh on major pairs, with EUR\/USD breaking below its 50 and 100 DMAs. USD strength also saw downside in fixed income markets, with T-notes heading into the North American crossover lower by round 11 ticks and Bunds Dec’15 futures trading below 155.50. 
 
On today’s US event calendar we will get the third and final reading for Q2 GDP where the consensus expectation is for no change to the 3.7% print. We’ll also get the flash services and composite PMI readings along with the final September print for University of Michigan consumer sentiment. Fedspeak wise it’s the turn of Bullard and George today. Hopefully they will be better “hydrated” than Yellen.

DB concludes the key event wrap of the previous day 
 
So after another volatile and ultimately weak day for risk assets once again yesterday, Fed Chair Yellen, speaking after markets closed, underlined her case that raising rates will be appropriate later this year but also sought to add some soothing words around the outlook for the US economy. Yellen said that ‘it will be likely appropriate to raise the target range of the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue boosting short term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labour market improves further and inflation moves back to our 2% objective’. Yellen suggested that this was the view of most FOMC participants and that the more prudent strategy would be to begin tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace. Unsurprisingly, the Fed Chair highlighted the well versed transitory factors holding back inflation, namely lower energy prices and the stronger Dollar but made mention once again that these factors are expected to wane. The labour market was highlighted as ‘not being far away from full employment’, while her view on US economic prospects was that they ‘generally appear solid’. 
 
While the overall tone felt certainly more upbeat relative to last week, warning signs were still signaled which should keep the market guessing. Yellen noted that ‘we cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the domestic economy will continue to fade’ and that ‘recent global economic and financial developments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain US economic activity somewhat further’. While she was of the view that the Fed will be ready to move later this year, it was noted that ‘if the economy surprises us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change’. December liftoff expectations have been given a boost following the speech with a move now priced at 49%, up from 43% this time yesterday. Markets are pricing in little chance of a rate rise next month however, still hovering around 18%. 
 
Overnight in Asia the only major data point has been Japan’s August inflation print. Looking at the numbers and it was something of a mixed report with the CPI excluding fresh food figure slipping into negative territory for the first time since April 2013 at -0.1% YoY, although the number excluding food and energy rose to +0.8% YoY. The report and the potential implications of it for the BoJ’s purchase program has helped Japanese markets buck the trend in overnight action with the Nikkei up +0.7% whilst the Hang Seng fell -0.5%, the Shanghai composite fell -1.8% and the broad S&P Asia 50 was down -0.7%. Debate as to whether the BoJ will adjust their policy at their next meeting on October 7th will certainly continue after these latest reads. 
 
Back to yesterday. Sentiment continues to be rocked in markets at the moment and yesterday’s news out of Caterpillar that the company is set to cut up to 10,000 jobs as well cutting its full year revenue forecast set a ripple effect through the industrials sector. Much like Wednesday, the S&P 500 did stage a +1% rebound off the intraday lows but it was too little too late once again as it finished the session down -0.34%. The index is in fact down 4.4% now from the highs shortly following the FOMC decision last week after the fifth daily decline in the last six days. The losses were steeper in the European session as the fallout from the emissions scandal spread to other carmakers with BMW now the latest to come under scrutiny. That saw the DAX (-1.92%) plummet to the lowest level this year while the Stoxx 600 sold-off -2.12% with YTD returns dipping into the negative territory for the first time this year. It’s amazing to think that the index at one stage in April had seen YTD gains as high as +21%. European credit markets were also weak yesterday with Crossover and Main widening 18bps and 5bps respectively. The commodity complex was actually relatively well behaved. WTI and Brent finished up just shy of a percent, while Aluminum (+0.13%) and Copper (-0.12%) were little moved. Gold was the outlier however after surging over 2% yesterday to the highest level in a month. 
 
Meanwhile, it was a big day for Central Bank moves yesterday as we saw Norway, Taiwan and Ukraine all ease. The big surprise was in Norway where the Norges Bank cut the overnight deposit rate by 25bps to 0.75% and to an all-time low while at the same time hinted at further cuts ahead. The first cut by Taiwan since 2009 was also a surprise to the majority, while in the Ukraine borrowing costs were lowered for the second consecutive month. Refreshing our numbers and assuming the ECB as representing 19 CB’s, we make that 56 different Central Banks to have eased monetary policy this year, of which 13 by our count were a surprise relative to market expectations. 
 
There was plenty of economic data for markets to absorb yesterday too. In the US August headline durable goods declined -2.0% mom, although slightly better than the -2.3% decline expected with the fall attributed to the volatile aircraft and defense components. Excluding transportation, the print was a smidgen behind consensus (0.0% mom vs. +0.1% expected). Core capex orders (-0.2% mom) fell as expected having risen 2.1% in July. Meanwhile, there was further weakness in the Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity index which printed at -8 (vs. -6 expected) for September. There was weakness also in the Chicago Fed national activity index (-0.41 vs. +0.24 expected) however better news was to be had in the housing sector. New home sales rose +5.7% mom in August (vs. +1.6% expected) with a decent upward revision to July also. That saw the annualized rate of new home sales rise 30k to 552k and the highest in seven years. Finally, initial jobless claims printed at 267k last week, nudging the four week average down to 272k and the lowest in more than a month. 
 
Before this in Europe, headlines dominated by the emissions scandal overshadowed what was actually a relatively upbeat German IFO reading. The September business climate headline reading rose a modest 0.1pts to 108.5 (vs. 107.9 expected). This was given a lift by the expectations index which rose 1.1pts to 103.3 (vs. 101.4 expected) and the highest since April which offset a slight decline in the current assessment index to 114 (vs. 114.7 expected), a fall of 0.8pts. Our colleagues in Germany believe that the latest data supports their case of 0.5% quarterly growth in Q3, in line with what the composite PMI suggested. 
 
Before we take a look at today’s calendar, one event which will be worth keeping an eye on this Sunday will be the election in Catalonia. Yesterday, DB’s Marco Stringa and Abhishek Singhania published a note updating the current situation and looking ahead to what the elections may mean further down the line. They note that the recent polls have suggested pro-independence Junts pel Si and CUP are set to win the majority of seats and are creeping close to the majority of votes as well. Junts pel Si has argued that an absolute majority would be sufficient to declare victory in the de-factor referendum for independence regardless of the share of votes in any case. It pledges to declare unilaterally the independence of Catalonia in about 18 months unless the central government allows a binding referendum on independence. Our colleagues are of the view that given there is little else keeping such a heterogeneous coalition together, the pair will continue on the pro-independence path. However, what makes this more difficult is that any changing in the Constitution to allow Catalonia’s independence appears to be an extremely demanding scenario from both a legal and political perspective. The team also think that from an economic and financial perspective, a unilateral declaration of independence by Catalonia would likely be a lose-lose outcome for both Catalonia and Spain. There is also the risk that the election will leave a deeply divided Catalonia and deep division between Catalonia and the central government, so a negative outcome can’t be ruled out. Marco and Abhishek ultimately believe that a compromise in 2016 seems the most reasonable scenario, but it won’t be easy. 
 
Turning over to today’s calendar now then. It’s a fairly quiet end to the week in Europe this morning with just French consumer confidence and Euro area money supply data due. Over in the US this afternoon we will get the third and final reading for Q2 GDP where the consensus expectation is for no change to the 3.7% print. We’ll also get the flash services and composite PMI readings along with the final September print for University of Michigan consumer sentiment. Fedspeak wise it’s the turn of Bullard and George today.. UPDATE 1-Volkswagen to name Porsche boss as new CEO - source. * Porsche CEO Mueller has majority board support - source 

* Mueller held top posts at Audi, VW before running Porsche 

* VW declines to comment

 (Adds comment from VW labour boss, detail and background) 

BERLIN, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Volkswagen will name
the head of sports car maker Porsche as its group chief
executive on Friday to succeed Martin Winterkorn who quit over
the diesel emissions scandal, a source familiar with the matter
told Reuters. 
 
Mueller, VW's former head product strategist who joined the
group's top management board in March, is favoured by a majority
on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as
new CEO at a meeting on Friday, the source said. 

Winterkorn, an engineer by training who spent almost nine
years at the helm of Europe's largest automaker, resigned on
Wednesday, taking responsibility for the biggest business
scandal in VW's 78-year history. 
 
Mueller, 62, who held various positions at VW's luxury
flagship Audi before taking charge of Porsche in 2010, was also
the favourite candidate for VW's top job by long-time chairman
Ferdinand Piech, who quit in April after a power struggle with
Winterkorn. 
 
Labour representatives, occupying half of the 20 board
seats, would ""only accept a personality with great technical and
entrepreneurial expertise as well as great social competence,""
VW works council chief Bernd Osterloh said in a letter to
employees published on Thursday. 

VW declined to comment. 

Mueller's appointment will be part of a raft of personnel
decisions and dismissals by the board including the firing of
R&D chiefs at Audi and Porsche, Ulrich Hackenberg and Wolfgang
Hatz, as well as VW's top U.S. executive Michael Horn, a source
told Reuters earlier on Thursday. 

 (Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Kirsti Knolle and Mark
Potter). Porsche's Mueller called in to steer VW through crisis. BERLIN (Reuters) - Porsche boss Matthias Mueller once joked that he was too old to run Volkswagen but the 62-year-old now looks certain to be given the task of steering the German car maker through the worst business crisis in its history. 
 
Mueller, VW's former head product strategist, is backed by a majority on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as new CEO at a meeting on Friday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
 
The top job at VW suddenly became available this week when chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigned after the company admitted that it deceived U.S. regulators about how much its diesel cars pollute. 
 
Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying information technology, has worked for parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors in getting the job. 
 
Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW. 
 
Mueller, promoted to VW's executive board in March, had been viewed as a favourite of family patriarch Ferdinand Piech who  reportedly sought to install him as VW CEO in place of Winterkorn earlier this year. 
 
    Winterkorn survived a power struggle that saw Piech himself forced to step down as company chairman and his job looked secure until the emissions scandal broke last week. 
 
Mueller, Rupert Stadler, who runs VW's Audi brand, and VW brand head Herbert Diess had been seen as the front-runners to replace Winterkorn as VW hastily sought a successor. 
 
""He is a good choice even though he may be seen as a transitory CEO until another internal candidate such as VW brand CEO Diess has earned their stripes,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. 
 
Mueller is known for a laid-back style, often appearing at car shows in a casual jumper rather than the expensively tailored suits favoured by fellow executives. 
 
But he does not lack ambition. 
 
Mueller used the Frankfurt auto show this month to toss his hat into the ring to lead VW's sports-car operations as VW  adopted a new structure to boost foreign sales and profits. 
 
Those goals will have to take second place to a more basic need to rescue the Volkswagen group from a crisis that threatens to destroy its reputation for reliability and engineering excellence. 
 
Mueller made his name as product manager for Audi's successful A3 model in the 1990s. He then worked as VW's head product strategist until 2010 when he was asked to lead Porsche. 
 
Under his leadership, Porsche has expanded and expects to increase sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early. 
 
(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach in Stuttgart and Andreas Cremer in Berlin; Writing by Keith Weir; Editing by Giles Elgood). Volkswagen diesel scandal: Why it's so much worse than it looks for VW. The headlines look bad for VW. But the numbers look a whole lot worse. 

VW names Matthias Mueller as CEO Pretend you are a director of VW at yet another emergency board meeting. Over the weekend, Switzerland has announced a ban on the sale of all VW's, affecting 180,000 unsold cars and trucks.

That doesn't really even seem to matter, since your company has already suspended US and European sales of the mainstay of its range, the 2.0 litre TDI diesel. Last year VW sold 2.44 million diesel cars, or 25 per cent of its total output (including petrol and electric).

But as serious as the diesel problem is, the main game here is so much larger, for two reasons.

First, it's not just a question about VW's diesel, but whether the diesel engine itself has a commercial future. Or is this the moment the global auto industry uses to do a hard reboot and shift to electric, greenlighting the electric car for the mainstream? We'll get to that in a minute.

First, the board meeting. VW is a family of brands – Skoda, Audi, SEAT, Bentley (the 4WD turbo diesel Bentley Bentayga is already set for release this year) and even Porsche. (Yes, Porsche. It sells a diesel 4WD the engine for which may have come from VW.)

Did I mention that Porsche also owns 30 per cent of the voting equity of VW? In fact, there are two Porsche family representatives just across the VW board table. They look very uncomfortable. What now?

Forget the recriminations, and who knew what when, and assume the sackings, fines and custodial sentences are a given. The central question you are gathered around to answer is: what now?

As a board member, you will hear argument that the company must continue with the diesel, because the shareholders (including the director, seated to your left, representing the government of the German state of Lower Saxony, which has a 20 per cent voting interest) are demanding their dividend, which they use for public works including schools and hospitals. The Porsche family may be agreeing, although it could just be the light.

At the same time you will be aware of tens of thousands of workers and their families who are facing financial losses in part from possibility of job cuts, and second from the fall in the value of VW stock.

You all agree that pressing on with diesel is the best course of action. The question is how?

The balance sheet shows VW has around €351 billion ($560 billion) in total assets deployed around the world, manufacturing, assembling, distributing, maintaining and financing cars.

Of that, VW has €44 billion ($70.1 billion) in property plant and equipment. You will have to decide how much of this to write off and then put a number to what will be a multi-billion Euro amount to re-tool the asset base to bring diesel up to the lied-about specification, or at least to that of other diesel car makers. Sales slump

For the next couple of years, you will have to get used to sales which could be 75 per cent of what they were. Profit structures being what they are, this could cut earnings by more than half, before the write-offs, which will run for years.

One very important issue will be whether the other makers have been cheating as well. If they haven't then VW could copy their technology and compete head to head.

But if the others manufacturers have been cheating – and remember this is a distinct possibility given that the problem has been going on for ten years – then the cheating could be industry wide.

It is here the current thinking on diesel needs to be factored in.

There have been a rash of serious complaints in Europe and the US about diesel in the past few years – for example Kings College London is claiming 5800 premature deaths from emissions, while the US is claiming 10 times that figure.

All this time the electric car will be gaining traction. By which is meant charging stations, the global re-think about what a car needs to be (who needs 500 kilometre range when most trips are to the shops?) carbon pricing and of course China, the car industry for which is going global and electric as fast as it can.

Meanwhile the value of Tesla, at $US33 billion ($47 billion), is already more than half that of VW and it only sells 1 per cent of the cars. Why bother retooling for diesel to arrive at the same time the electric car has gone mainstream, either by government degree (because of emissions) or consumer taste. Significant liability

The assets backing these liabilities will be pretty much entirely vehicles, the value of which has just fallen very significantly.

Volkswagen diesel scandal: Why it's so much worse than it looks for VW. Pretend you are a director of VW at yet another emergency board meeting. Over the weekend, Switzerland has announced a ban on the sale of all VW's, affecting 180,000 unsold cars and trucks. 

That doesn't really even seem to matter, since your company has already suspended US and European sales of the mainstay of its range, the 2.0 litre TDI diesel. Last year VW sold 2.44 million diesel cars, or 25 per cent of its total output (including petrol and electric). 

But as serious as the diesel problem is, the main game here is so much larger, for two reasons. 

First, it's not just a question about VW's diesel, but whether the diesel engine itself has a commercial future. Or is this the moment the global auto industry uses to do a hard reboot and shift to electric, greenlighting the electric car for the mainstream?  We'll get to that in a minute. 

First, the board meeting. VW is a family of brands – Skoda, Audi, SEAT, Bentley (the 4WD turbo diesel Bentley Bentayga is already set for release this year) and even Porsche. (Yes, Porsche. It sells a diesel 4WD the engine for which may have come from VW.) 

Did I mention that Porsche also owns 30 per cent of the voting equity of VW? In fact, there are two Porsche family representatives just across the VW board table. They look very uncomfortable. 
What now? 
Forget the recriminations, and who knew what when, and assume the sackings, fines and custodial sentences are a given. The central question you are gathered around to answer is: what now? 

As a board member, you will hear argument that the company must continue with the diesel, because the shareholders (including the director, seated to your left, representing the government of the German state of Lower Saxony, which has a 20 per cent voting interest) are demanding their dividend, which they use for public works including schools and hospitals. The Porsche family may be agreeing, although it could just be the light. 

At the same time you will be aware of tens of thousands of workers and their families who are facing financial losses in part from possibility of job cuts, and second from the fall in the value of VW stock. 

You all agree that pressing on with diesel is the best course of action. The question is how? 

The balance sheet shows VW has around €351 billion ($560 billion) in total assets deployed around the world, manufacturing, assembling, distributing, maintaining and financing cars. 

Of that, VW has €44 billion ($70.1 billion) in property plant and equipment. You will have to decide how much of this to write off and then put a number to what will be a multi-billion Euro amount to re-tool the asset base to bring diesel up to the lied-about specification, or at least to that of other diesel car makers. 
Sales slump 
For the next couple of years, you will have to get used to sales which could be 75 per cent of what they were. Profit structures being what they are, this could cut earnings by more than half, before the write-offs, which will run for years. 

One very important issue will be whether the other makers have been cheating as well. If they haven't then VW could copy their technology and compete head to head. 

But if the others manufacturers have been cheating – and remember this is a distinct possibility given that the problem has been going on for ten years – then the cheating could be industry wide. 

It is here the current thinking on diesel needs to be factored in. 

There have been a rash of serious complaints in Europe and the US about diesel in the past few years – for example Kings College London is claiming 5800 premature deaths from emissions, while the US is claiming 10 times that figure. 

All this time the electric car will be gaining traction. By which is meant charging stations, the global re-think about what a car needs to be (who needs 500 kilometre range when most trips are to the shops?) carbon pricing and of course China, the car industry for which is going global and electric as fast as it can. 

Meanwhile the value of Tesla, at $US33 billion ($47 billion), is already more than half that of VW and it only sells 1 per cent of the cars. Why bother retooling for diesel to arrive at the same time the electric car has gone mainstream, either by government degree (because of emissions) or consumer taste. 
Significant liability 
And now we get to the second issue. Buried in the VW accounts is a finance book with €135 billion in liabilities. The assets backing these liabilities will be pretty much entirely vehicles, the value of which has just fallen very significantly. (If you bought a VW diesel yesterday, you are already looking at a much larger drop to resale value than you bargained for. Multiply that out and it's a hefty class action). 

So as well as a car maker, VW is also virtually a bank, requiring a portion of its book to be written off too. There may be questions about bail-outs. It is a dead certainty that Angela Merkel will soon be addressing the board in her official capacity. This just keeps getting worse.

BERLIN\/HAMBURG (Reuters) - The supervisory board of Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Porsche business may name the sports-car maker's production chief Oliver Blume as the division's new chief executive this week, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. 
 
Blume, a former manager at VW's luxury division Audi who has overseen production at Porsche since 2013, will replace Matthias Mueller, who has taken the helm at Volkswagen, the sources said. 
 
Porsche declined to comment. 
 
The Stuttgart-based division is grappling with the loss of several executives since VW was rocked by the admission that it cheated U.S. vehicle emissions tests. 
 
Mueller replaced Martin Winterkorn, who resigned as CEO of Europe's largest automaker last Wednesday amid VW's biggest business-related scandal in its 78-year-history. 
 
The departure of Mueller, who ran Porsche for almost five years, came a day after personnel chief Thomas Edig quit Porsche to join VW's commercial-vehicles division. 
 
Porsche's development chief Wolfgang Hatz has been suspended by VW's supervisory board, together with his counterparts at Audi and the VW brand, sources told Reuters earlier on Monday.

NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Stock futures were sharply higher on Friday after  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen laid out details of her vision for monetary policy in coming months.  

S&P 500 futures were up 1.2%, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 1.3%, and Nasdaq futures gained 1%. 
 
In a speech at the University of Massachusetts on Thursday, Yellen made the case for a rate hike this year, though argued that the decision would continue to rely on economic data. Yellen said that inflation would build gradually over the next few years. Markets have been erratic since the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged at their meeting last week with investors interpreting that as another sign of uncertainty.   
 
Caterpillar   ( CAT - Get Report )  shares were moving higher in premarket trading after a sharp drop a day earlier. The industrial machinery company was the worst performer on the Dow on Thursday after it said it expects to cut 4,000 to 5,000 jobs by the end of 2016. The total number of job cuts could amount to 10,000 by the end of 2018.  
 
 
    
Volkswagen   ( VLKAY )  is expected to announce its new CEO on Friday. CEO Martin Winterkorn, who resigned on Wednesday, will reportedly be replaced by Porsche's CEO Matthias Muller in the wake of a massive emissions scandal, according to The Wall Street Journal . Earlier this week, the German automaker admitted that more than 11 million diesel vehicles had software that gamed emissions tests.

WOLFSBURG, Germany, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Volkswagen
 knows it will take much more than just new
leadership and a corporate overhaul to clear the air after it
was caught cheating in U.S. diesel emissions tests. 
    
Beyond the measures announced by the German carmaker on
Friday, VW executives, customers, investors and workers alike
are struggling to divine what lies ahead. 
    
The new chief executive, 62-year-old Matthias Mueller, until
now head of the Porsche sports-car division, faces a host of
problems that had already been looming before the diesel scandal
broke and may now be worsened by its repercussions.
  Continued.... VW has named a new CEO. AP	See Also Report: Porsche CEO will take charge at VW VW CEO is out It will be tricky for VW to name a new CEO Volkswagen has named Matthias Müller as its new CEO. The 62-year-old Müller was CEO of Porsche, which is among VW Group's brands. Müller's appointment comes as VW reels from an emissions-cheating scandal that has affected 11 million vehicles worldwide. ""My most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group – by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation,"" Müller said in a statement. ""Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do everything it can to develop and implement the most stringent compliance and governance standards in our industry. If we manage to achieve that then the Volkswagen Group with its innovative strength, its strong brands and above all its competent and highly motivated team has the opportunity to emerge from this crisis stronger than before."" The VW supervisory board met Friday to vote on Müller's candidacy. Made up of members of VW Group management, labor leaders, representatives of the Porsche family, and the government of Lower Saxony, where VW is headquartered, the supervisory board has moved swiftly to deal with the scandal since the news broke last week. Former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who had survived a management crisis earlier this year, resigned on Tuesday. Bernd Osterloh, who leads the VW Group Works Council, the automaker's union, said in a statement that ""when it comes to leadership appointments the Volkswagen Group does not need hasty decisions. He added: ""We know and value Matthias Müller for his determination and decisiveness. He does not work on his own, rather he is a team player. That is what Volkswagen needs now."" Müller has been with the VW Group for decades. He began his career in the German auto industry in the 1970s, as an apprentice before going to college, and then rose through the ranks. He has presided over Porsche's transformation from a maker of expensive sports cars to a company that sells luxury SUV and sedans in both the developed and developing world. Müller also has the support of former VW chairman Ferdinand Piëch, who was ousted from the VW board earlier this year, but continues to exert influence. During VW's management crisis, Müller was suggested as a CEO to replace Winterkorn, who was under fire for VW's weak performance in the US and its sprawling worldwide growth. Various media reports has also noted that Müller was supported by both the Porsche family (of which Piëch is a member) and VW's powerful labor unions. Müller will continue as Chairman of Porsche, the VW Group said, until a replacement is found. Additional VW executives, including its US leadership, were also slated to be dismissed.

By Nigel Stephenson

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares slid on Tuesday, with Europe led lower by mining companies as copper prices fell on worries over Chinese demand, while the dollar rose to its highest in almost two weeks after Federal Reserve officials signalled U.S. interest rates might rise this year.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index fell 2.6 percent, reversing a trend that had seen stocks rise in Asia. Wall Street was expected to open lower, according to index futures.

An index of Europe-listed mining shares dropped 5.6 percent after copper retreated 2.5 percent. 

Worries over a slowdown in the Chinese economy have weighed on markets in recent weeks, and preliminary factory activity data for September will be a focus for investors on Wednesday.

""If China manufacturing numbers come in better than expected tomorrow, we could see a rebound in mining stocks for some days, but the sector's medium-term outlook remains bearish,"" Christian Stocker, equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich.

A further fall in shares of German carmaker Volkswagen, which has admitted cheating on vehicle emission tests, also took a toll on the FTSEurofirst, as an investigation of the cheating spread to Asia. VW shares were last down 19 percent. Porsche, part of the VW group, lost 17 percent. 

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gave up earlier gains and was last down 0.3 percent.

Chinese shares rose, with the Shanghai Composite and the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen both closing up about 0.9 percent.

Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

Weakness in stock markets helped lift the yen against the dollar, though the divergence between the Fed on the one hand and the ECB and Bank of Japan on the other helped push the dollar to its highest since Sept. 10 against a basket of currencies. 

The U.S. Federal Reserve held policy steady last week, citing risks to global growth. But Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday he still expected rates to rise this year and St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard said there was a chance of a hike next month.

By contrast, European Central Bank officials have been stressing monetary policy in the euro zone will remain loose for some time. Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday ECB rates would stay low as long as growth did.

The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.1155, having hit a high of $1.1459 on Friday. The dollar eased 0.5 percent to 119.96 yen per dollar but was still above Friday lows.

Expectations of a prolonged period of low ECB rates, and the fall in stocks, pushed down yields on low-risk euro zone debt. German 10-year Bund yields hit a one-month low at 0.62 percent, down 6 basis points on the day. 

The ECB launched a trillion-euro bond buying programme in March, but has failed to raise the market's long-term inflation expectations.

""I'm not too convinced that they are signalling they are ready to do something in October, but it does support our view that if nothing changes between now and December, the ECB may have to add more stimulus,"" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank.

Oil prices fell as concern over global growth weakened the outlook for demand and as traders took profits from a rise of 3 to 4 percent on Monday.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 79 cents a barrel at $48.13. Gold eased with stocks and commodities. It last traded at $1,128.40 an ounce.

Launched in 1990, 25 years ago, the Mercedes-Benz 500 E with V8 engine and subtly muscular body is the top-of-the-range model in the 124 model series 

| 

Launched in 1990, 25 years ago, the Mercedes-Benz 500 E with V8 engine and subtly muscular body is the top-of-the-range model in the 124 model series – and has long been one of the brand’s most desirable ‘young classic’ models. 

A modest appearance, at first glance – this is one side of the Mercedes-Benz 500 E. Only the somewhat more voluminous wings, the slightly lower body and a modified front apron with inset fog lamps differentiate it from the other models in the 124 series. But then there’s the engine: eight cylinders in a ‘V’ configuration, a displacement of 5 litres, 326 hp (240 kW) of power. All of which makes this saloon something of a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It takes just 6.1 seconds for the sprint from 0 to 100 km\/h, while the top speed is electronically limited to 250 km\/h – performance figures worthy of a sports car. 

The combination of all these ingredients and characteristics creates the allure that the 500 E has exuded since the moment of its first appearance at the Paris motor show in October 1990. You can still feel it today. Indeed, this powerful saloon has long been one of the most highly sought-after young classic cars bearing the three-pointed star. Just 10,479 units were built in the years until 1995 – a figure that also includes the E 60 AMG, with which it is counted in the production statistics. The first 500 E cost 134,520 deutschmarks – more than twice as much as a 300 E, a car which itself could not exactly be called unspectacular. By the end the price was 145,590 deutschmarks for an E 500, as it was designated from 1993 onwards. So it is perhaps hardly surprising that there are very few well-preserved 500 E\/E 500 models still around. But anyone who does buy one, will find they have an exceptional and powerful saloon that is nevertheless extremely practical for everyday use. 

The engine and four-speed automatic transmission were taken from the 500 SL, but the 500 E did incorporate several other new features: it was the first car to feature what was known as the “standard deck” engine – one and the same crankcase used for both the 4.2 and the 5.0-litre unit. This meant that the 5.0-litre engine was 16.5 millimetres lower here than when it made its debut in the 500 SL (R 129) a year and a half earlier. Shorter connecting rods ensured that the bore-stroke ratio remained the same. In addition, in the E 500 the Bosch LH-Jetronic injection system, with electronic control and air-mass sensor, replaced the previously used mechanical\/electronic KE system. From October 1992 the engine output was lowered slightly to 320 hp (235 kW), in order to reduce both fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Compared with the 500 SL, the 500 E had a shorter axle ratio (1:2.82), so benefiting acceleration. The top speed of both models was electronically limited to 250 km\/h. 

Small-series production at Porsche 

The 500 E, incidentally, was created in close cooperation with Porsche: also based in Stuttgart, the sports car manufacturer was brought on board by Mercedes-Benz at a very early stage in order to boost the company’s own somewhat stretched development capacity. The manufacturing process was subsequently split: the bodyshell was painted at the Mercedes-Benz Sindelfingen plant, while the final assembly of the components supplied from Sindelfingen and Untertürkheim was undertaken by Porsche in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. There were two reasons for this. First of all, the production order came as a timely stroke of good fortune during what was a somewhat difficult period for the sports car manufacturer in the early 1990s. And secondly, the relatively small volume was an ideal match for the manufacturing processes at Porsche, meaning that production of the 500 E could not have been in better hands. 

The powerful saloon benefited from the last facelift of the W 124 model series in 1993. The first change related to the name: the mid-series was renamed E-Class and, as with the other model series, the model designation now preceded the figures and the “E” for injection engine (“Einspritzer” in German) was omitted, making the 500 E the E 500. The design idio…. What Sih Fuel The Pas Create a Supercar?. Fuel benchmark Supercar From Porsche - Nowadays, so many types of cars that can be selected for the consumer. Each also has its own specifications and standard machines. Different types, usually will be different also imposed standards. Included is a standard fuel used. Well, this time mas Sena would invite you to look at the type of cars top-class supercar. Roughly, fuel standards like, which are used in the car? If you look at the label as a super car, it is looming if the fuel used is not fuel carelessly.
fuel fitting for supercar Currently, the class supercar Porsche for example, has many bersliweran on Indonesian roads. The owner was certainly not one to mess around. If we talk about fuel supercar, in an emergency it is possible to fill up with fuel supercar standards. Well, to know what the standards are still to be fulfilled, the manufacturer-Porsche supercar has leaked benchmark.
Luke Lukasiewicz, After Sales Manager of Porsche Indonesia, explained that the supercar standard requires fuel with octane levels are quite high. So he recommends, should be applied consumers Porsche is using fuel with RON figures 95 to 98.
""Of course the higher number RON her better. Even in Germany many use fuel RON 100. As you know, Porsche engine technology is very high, even the Euro5 emission standard can reach up to Euro6. Maximum performance will be more easily accessible, ""said Luke.
However, as already mas Sena conveyed earlier, there are emergency conditions, where the supercar would not want to consume fuel ""should not"". For this one, the tolerance limit is RON fuel or the octane content of at least 90. For Porsche, that's the most ugly standard.
If we talk about fuel, is currently preparing to enforce the use of fuel types Pertalite. As we all know, fuel type Premium will soon be abolished. Given the quality, Pertalite have RON 90. So in other words, in an emergency, could Pertalite
taken by cars Porsche. However, there are consequences to be borne.
""It can still be tolerated RON 90, but the consequences, the performance will be reduced by about 20 percent, in this case the horse power,"" said Luke.

The words “ Porsche ” and “turbo” have been synonymous with ultimate high performance since 1972, when the automaker first used boosted engines in the mighty 917\/10 Can-Am racecars. For 2016MY, the company is introducing all-new turbocharged 3.0-L flat-six engines for the 911 Carrera and Carrera S road cars, replacing naturally aspirated (NA) 3.4-L and 3.8-L units. The 911 that carries the specific ""Turbo"" designation, however, will continue to use a 3.8-L engine. 
 
The 3.0-L Carreras will be unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show . The downsized-and-boosted ""boxer"" brings new levels of efficiency and added power; the Carrera gets an extra 15 kW (20 hp) taking peak output to 272 kW (365 hp). The Carrera S produces 309 kW (414 hp), also a 15-kW improvement. The new engines use two BorgWarner turbos, one per cylinder bank. 
 
The S version of the 3.0 L features modified turbine compressors, a specific exhaust system and tuned engine management. Boost pressure is 0.9 bar (13 psi) in the Carrera and 1.1 bar (16 psi) in the Carrera S. The new engine also produces more peak torque – an added 60 N·m (44 lb·ft), delivered from 1700 to 5000 rpm, to provide 450 N·m and 500 N·m (331 and 368 lb·ft), respectively. Both variants are rev-limited to 7500 rpm. 
 
Performance of both the Carrera and Carrera S is slightly improved, the S fitted with PDK (dual clutch) and Sport Chrono Package achieving a claimed 0-100 km\/h in 3.9 s, and top speed of 307 km\/h (190 mph). But fuel consumption and emissions are markedly better; the S with PDK achieves a combined figure of 7.7 L\/100 km, an improvement of 1.0 L\/100 km. Claimed CO 2 emissions are 169 g\/km for the regular Carrera, 174 g\/km for the Carrera S. 
 
According to Porsche technology spokesperson Nick Perry, the new 911 models will not be badged “Turbo.” He also explained that the very high performance 911 GT variants were a “separate topic” with regard to the application of turbocharging: “The current Turbo will continue to be described as that; the model offers a different image and attributes to those of the Carrera. We have turbochargers in the Panamera, Cayenne and Macan, but there, too, we use the designation Turbo for top of the range versions.” 
 
Inside the new boxer 
 
Track-to-road technology transfer is a major element of Porsche’s engineering creed but its racing 911s have NA engines to meet regulations. “The NA GTRS 4.0-L engine will continue to power our 911s in the motorsport realm,"" Perry explained. ""But for road cars there is a multitude of criteria to meet, which is why we are introducing the new engine."" 
 
He described the new engine as a ""step-change""—the 3.0-L being all-new and not a derivative of the 3.4 and 3.8 engines. The move is similar to when Porsche went to liquid cooling (1998MY) to reduce drive-by noise, improve performance and efficiency, running the engines hotter and achieving better combustion. Another step-change came in 2008 with the introduction of direct fuel injection. 
 
Porsche is making no formal comment about the new 3.0-L turbo family forming the basis of engines for other models ranges including the Boxster and Cayman, but siblings can be expected. 
 
The use of forced induction has required a new engine airflow system for combustion and intercooling at the rear of the Carreras. The engine gets its combustion air centrally in front of the rear spoiler. From two lateral ports on the air filter box, the airflow reaches two induction channels to the lower-mounted turbochargers. The compressed and heated air then flows through two intercoolers located laterally behind the wheel arches and onwards to the engine's induction manifold via the throttle plate. Two other ducts guide the air for cooling the heated combustion air (also from the air screen in the rear lid) to the intercoolers. 
 
The 3.0-L’s injectors are located in the center of the combustion chamber for greater combustion efficiency. They are fed by two fuel pumps, one per cylinder bank, operating on a system pressure of up to 250 bar (3626 psi). Variable exhaust-camshaft timing facilitates precise control of the charge exchange process. On the intake side, Porsche continues to use VarioCam Plus, adjusting both valve lift and opening duration. 
 
A new cylinder wall coating process, in which a plasma beam coats the bore surface with iron, helps reduce friction losses, according to Porsche engineers. And extensive FEA analysis during the design process helped cut the weight of the aluminum crankcase by 1.5 kg (3.3 lb). A new engineered-plastic oil pan is 2 kg (4.4 lb) lighter than in the previous generation engines. 
 
The water pump now has a clutch that is controlled by thermal management and can remain disengaged at low coolant temperatures. The deactivated pump no longer draws any engine power, and the coolant just circulates slowly. Friction is reduced and the engine reaches its operating temperature more quickly. The same applies to the air conditioning compressor; it can also be completely deactivated via a clutch. 
 
Mode-switching drivetrain 
 
Transmission developments include introduction of a two-disc clutch for the new engines for comfortable operation despite the new 3.0-L’s high torque. And the PDK has new operating logic. As in the 911 GT3 and many Porsche racecars, pulling the selector lever back now provides upshifting; pressing it forward triggers downshifting. Porsche is now using a dual-mass flywheel with a centrifugal pendulum in conjunction with the PDK, as well as intelligent overrun cut-off and ""virtual"" gears. 
 
The centrifugal pendulum is also used with the manual transmission. It has an adaptive vibration absorber that dampens vibrations in the drivetrain over a broad range of engine speeds, according to Porsche engineers. 
 
In combination with the Sport Chrono and PDK systems, the 911 driver now has a “mode switch” which has an additional “sport response” button which activates a pre-conditioned drivetrain response which provides maximum acceleration for 20 s, the optimum gear engaged and engine management adjusted for optimum spontaneous response such as for overtaking. 
 
Active rear-axle steering and suspension 
 
Complementing the new powertrain developments, chassis changes for the 911 include active rear axle steering as an option for the Carrera S, The technology is adapted from the 911 Turbo and the 911 GT3 as well as the exotic limited-production 918 Spyder. 
 
The active rear axle is designed to enhance the turn-in behavior of the 911 and reduces the car’s turning circle by 0.5 m (1.6 ft). Porsche is offering a 360-mm-diameter (14-in) steering wheel that is 15-mm (0.6-in) smaller than the previous wheel. 
 
Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) is fitted to all Carreras for 2016. It lowers ride height by 10 mm (0.4 in). An optional hydraulic lift system increases the car’s ground clearance by 40 mm (1.6 in) via lifting cylinders in the front suspension struts to clear steep garage ramps and speed bumps. 
 
Porsche states that introducing turbocharging for the Carreras was a logical next step in a technology path that began four decades ago. The original Turbo engine of 1974 had a claimed power output of 194 kW (260 hp) and consumed 20.9 L of high-octane gasoline per 100 km. By comparison, the new-for-2016 flat six-cylinder engine produces 42% more power with more than twice the fuel economy, while using the same cylinder displacement. Progress all around!. Porsche boss Matthias Müller takes over for Winterkorn as Volkswagen’s CEO. Porsche's current head, Matthias Müller will reportedly take over for Martin Winterkorn as Volkswagen's CEO amid the brand's TDI crisis. Müller has been part of the VW Group since the 1970's. 
The post Porsche boss Matthias Müller takes over for Winterkorn as Volkswagen’s CEO appeared first on Digital Tr…  
According to a Volkswagen Group Press Release, Porsche boss Matthias Müller has been appointed Volkswagen Group CEO. Volkswagen’s 20-member board supported Müller for the position in the wake of the brand’s TDI scandal and Martin Winterkorn’s resignation. 

Though Winterkorn claimed he was unaware of the emissions-cheating devices placed in VW, Audi, (and possibly Porsche) TDI engines, and the VW Group affirmed his innocence, the Group’s leader decided to abdicate his authority. 

Müller has a rich history with Volkswagen as well, having worked for several VW Group departments since the 1970s. His extensive experience and ties to the Porsche-Piech family apparently led to his nomination and support. 

In related news, several high profile VW Group R&D executives have been canned. Heinz-Jakob Neusser, Ulrich Hackenberg, and Wolfgang Hatz (Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, respectively) have been let go, while the U.S.’s Michael Horn is expected to be replaced by current Skoda chief Winfried Vahland.

""Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do all it can to develop and implement the strictest compliance and governance standards in the whole industry,"" Mueller said in a statement. 

					  		     
AFP. Volkswagen CEO resigns over emissions scandal. Volkswagen AG chief executive officer Martin Winterkorn, who during nearly a decade at the helm catapulted VW to the top spot in global sales, stepped down after admitting the automaker cheated on U.S. emissions tests. 

“Volkswagen needs a fresh start - also in terms of personnel,” Winterkorn said in a statement Wednesday. “I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation.” 

The move capped a dramatic fall from grace that began last Friday with the revelation that the German-based company fitted diesel-powered vehicles with software that circumvented air pollution controls, then lied about it to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The 68-year-old CEO, who personally apologized for the affair, was unable to hang on as the stock price plummeted 35 percent over two days and pressure grew from the German government for quick action. 

Winterkorn, who took over in 2007, led a turnaround that propelled VW from an also-ran that had cut 20,000 German jobs under his predecessor to a global powerhouse with about 600,000 employees that included a stable of 12 brands from Lamborghini supercars to Scania heavy trucks. He expanded aggressively, boosting the number of production sites around the world to more than 100 locations, with an emphasis on China and North America. 

An avid soccer fan, he was accustomed to boardroom brawls and until Wednesday always came out on top. As chief of the luxury Audi division, where he set in motion a doubling of product offerings with models such as the Q7 SUV, he sparred with then-VW CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder over the direction of the company, eventually leading to Pischetsrieder’s ouster. 

Faced with a takeover attempt from Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking, Winterkorn fought off that effort as the global financial crisis undid the suitor’s company, turning the tables on his foe to buy the Porsche sports-car brand instead. His spending spree also included adding the MAN and Scania commercial-vehicle nameplates, as well as Ducati motorbikes. 

At his side throughout was his confidante and mentor Ferdinand Piech, the automaker’s supervisory board chairman and patriarch of the Porsche-Piech clan that owns 50.7 percent of VW’s voting stock. When Piech turned on Winterkorn this year, the CEO fought for his job and, to the surprise of many company insiders, won. Piech stepped down in April after Winterkorn rallied support from labor leaders and members of the controlling family led by Piech’s cousin,Wolfgang Porsche. 

The new CEO’s top priority will be getting to the bottom of a scheme intended to dupe regulators and consumers about emissions of diesel engines installed in 11 million cars worldwide – more vehicles than VW sells in a year. The automaker set aside $7.3 billion on Tuesday to cover potential costs.. Volkswagen diesel scandal: Why it's so much worse than it looks for VW. The headlines look bad for VW. But the numbers look a whole lot worse. 

VW names Matthias Mueller as CEO Pretend you are a director of VW at yet another emergency board meeting. Over the weekend, Switzerland has announced a ban on the sale of all VW's, affecting 180,000 unsold cars and trucks.

That doesn't really even seem to matter, since your company has already suspended US and European sales of the mainstay of its range, the 2.0 litre TDI diesel. Last year VW sold 2.44 million diesel cars, or 25 per cent of its total output (including petrol and electric).

But as serious as the diesel problem is, the main game here is so much larger, for two reasons.

First, it's not just a question about VW's diesel, but whether the diesel engine itself has a commercial future. Or is this the moment the global auto industry uses to do a hard reboot and shift to electric, greenlighting the electric car for the mainstream? We'll get to that in a minute.

First, the board meeting. VW is a family of brands – Skoda, Audi, SEAT, Bentley (the 4WD turbo diesel Bentley Bentayga is already set for release this year) and even Porsche. (Yes, Porsche. It sells a diesel 4WD the engine for which may have come from VW.)

Did I mention that Porsche also owns 30 per cent of the voting equity of VW? In fact, there are two Porsche family representatives just across the VW board table. They look very uncomfortable. What now?

Forget the recriminations, and who knew what when, and assume the sackings, fines and custodial sentences are a given. The central question you are gathered around to answer is: what now?

As a board member, you will hear argument that the company must continue with the diesel, because the shareholders (including the director, seated to your left, representing the government of the German state of Lower Saxony, which has a 20 per cent voting interest) are demanding their dividend, which they use for public works including schools and hospitals. The Porsche family may be agreeing, although it could just be the light.

At the same time you will be aware of tens of thousands of workers and their families who are facing financial losses in part from possibility of job cuts, and second from the fall in the value of VW stock.

You all agree that pressing on with diesel is the best course of action. The question is how?

The balance sheet shows VW has around €351 billion ($560 billion) in total assets deployed around the world, manufacturing, assembling, distributing, maintaining and financing cars.

Of that, VW has €44 billion ($70.1 billion) in property plant and equipment. You will have to decide how much of this to write off and then put a number to what will be a multi-billion Euro amount to re-tool the asset base to bring diesel up to the lied-about specification, or at least to that of other diesel car makers. Sales slump

For the next couple of years, you will have to get used to sales which could be 75 per cent of what they were. Profit structures being what they are, this could cut earnings by more than half, before the write-offs, which will run for years.

One very important issue will be whether the other makers have been cheating as well. If they haven't then VW could copy their technology and compete head to head.

But if the others manufacturers have been cheating – and remember this is a distinct possibility given that the problem has been going on for ten years – then the cheating could be industry wide.

It is here the current thinking on diesel needs to be factored in.

There have been a rash of serious complaints in Europe and the US about diesel in the past few years – for example Kings College London is claiming 5800 premature deaths from emissions, while the US is claiming 10 times that figure.

All this time the electric car will be gaining traction. By which is meant charging stations, the global re-think about what a car needs to be (who needs 500 kilometre range when most trips are to the shops?) carbon pricing and of course China, the car industry for which is going global and electric as fast as it can.

Meanwhile the value of Tesla, at $US33 billion ($47 billion), is already more than half that of VW and it only sells 1 per cent of the cars. Why bother retooling for diesel to arrive at the same time the electric car has gone mainstream, either by government degree (because of emissions) or consumer taste. Significant liability

And now we get to the second issue. Buried in the VW accounts is a finance book with €135 billion in liabilities. The assets backing these liabilities will be pretty much entirely vehicles, the value of which has just fallen very significantly. (If you bought a VW diesel yesterday, you are already looking at a much larger drop to resale value than you bargained for. Multiply that out and it's a hefty class action).

So as well as a car maker, VW is also virtually a bank, requiring a portion of its book to be written off too. There may be questions about bail-outs. It is a dead certainty that Angela Merkel will soon be addressing the board in her official capacity. This just keeps getting worse.

The supervisory board, which met for seven hours on Friday, named four-decade company veteran Müller to replace Martin Winterkorn, who quit Wednesday as the diesel cheating scandal widened and countries around the globe announced investigations. 
 
The 62-year-old Porsche chief takes charge a week after VW was found to have cheated on diesel-emission tests in the U.S. beginning in 2009, triggering billions in potential fines and a U.S. criminal investigation. The crisis wiped about 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) off VW’s market value this week, and the company estimates irregularities on diesel-emission readings extend to 11 million vehicles around the world.

Müller, who studied information technology and joined the Audi division as a toolmaking apprentice in the early 1970s, is the first non-engineer to run VW since 1992, when Carl Hahn retired from the post. Hahn studied economics. 
 
Müller – who has a cool, cosmopolitan demeanour – boosted Porsche profit 62 per cent over four years. Deliveries are on track to surpass 200,000 vehicles for the first time in 2015, with the addition of new models such as the Macan compact SUV.

Newsmaker - Porsche's Mueller called in to steer VW through crisis. BERLIN (Reuters) - Porsche boss Matthias Mueller once joked that he was too old to run Volkswagen but the 62-year-old now looks certain to be given the task of steering the German car maker through the worst business crisis in its history.

Mueller, VW's former head product strategist, is backed by a majority on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as new CEO at a meeting on Friday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

The top job at VW suddenly became available this week when chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigned after the company admitted that it deceived U.S. regulators about how much its diesel cars pollute.

Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying information technology, has worked for parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors in getting the job.

Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW.

Mueller, promoted to VW's executive board in March, had been viewed as a favourite of family patriarch Ferdinand Piech who reportedly sought to install him as VW CEO in place of Winterkorn earlier this year.

Winterkorn survived a power struggle that saw Piech himself forced to step down as company chairman and his job looked secure until the emissions scandal broke last week.

Mueller, Rupert Stadler, who runs VW's Audi brand, and VW brand head Herbert Diess had been seen as the front-runners to replace Winterkorn as VW hastily sought a successor.

""He is a good choice even though he may be seen as a transitory CEO until another internal candidate such as VW brand CEO Diess has earned their stripes,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.

Mueller is known for a laid-back style, often appearing at car shows in a casual jumper rather than the expensively tailored suits favoured by fellow executives.

But he does not lack ambition.

Mueller used the Frankfurt auto show this month to toss his hat into the ring to lead VW's sports-car operations as VW adopted a new structure to boost foreign sales and profits.

Those goals will have to take second place to a more basic need to rescue the Volkswagen group from a crisis that threatens to destroy its reputation for reliability and engineering excellence.

Mueller made his name as product manager for Audi's successful A3 model in the 1990s. He then worked as VW's head product strategist until 2010 when he was asked to lead Porsche.

Under his leadership, Porsche has expanded and expects to increase sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early.

LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Shares slid on Tuesday, with Europe led lower by mining companies as copper prices fell on worries over Chinese demand, while the dollar rose to its highest in almost two weeks after Federal Reserve officials signalled U.S. interest rates might rise this year. 

					 
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index fell 2.6 percent, reversing a trend that had seen stocks rise in Asia. Wall Street was expected to open lower, according to index futures. 

					 
An index of Europe-listed mining shares dropped 5.6 percent after copper retreated 2.5 percent. 

					 
Worries over a slowdown in the Chinese economy have weighed on markets in recent weeks, and preliminary factory activity data for September will be a focus for investors on Wednesday. 

					 
""If China manufacturing numbers come in better than expected tomorrow, we could see a rebound in mining stocks for some days, but the sector's medium-term outlook remains bearish,"" Christian Stocker, equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich. 

					 
A further fall in shares of German carmaker Volkswagen , which has admitted cheating on vehicle emission tests, also took a toll on the FTSEurofirst, as an investigation of the cheating spread to Asia. VW shares were last down 19 percent. Porsche, part of the VW group, lost 17 percent. 

					 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gave up earlier gains and was last down 0.3 percent. 

					 
Chinese shares rose, with the Shanghai Composite and the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen both closing up about 0.9 percent. 

					 
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. 

					 
Weakness in stock markets helped lift the yen against the dollar, though the divergence between the Fed on the one hand and the ECB and Bank of Japan on the other helped push the dollar to its highest since Sept. 10 against a basket of currencies. 

					 
The U.S. Federal Reserve held policy steady last week, citing risks to global growth. But Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday he still expected rates to rise this year and St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard said there was a chance of a hike next month. 

					 
By contrast, European Central Bank officials have been stressing monetary policy in the euro zone will remain loose for some time. Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday ECB rates would stay low as long as growth did. 

					 
The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.1155, having hit a high of $1.1459 on Friday. The dollar eased 0.5 percent to 119.96 yen per dollar but was still above Friday lows. 

					 
Expectations of a prolonged period of low ECB rates, and the fall in stocks, pushed down yields on low-risk euro zone debt. German 10-year Bund yields hit a one-month low at 0.62 percent, down 6 basis points on the day. 

					 
The ECB launched a trillion-euro bond buying programme in March, but has failed to raise the market's long-term inflation expectations. 

					 
""I'm not too convinced that they are signalling they are ready to do something in October, but it does support our view that if nothing changes between now and December, the ECB may have to add more stimulus,"" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank. 

					 
Oil prices fell as concern over global growth weakened the outlook for demand and as traders took profits from a rise of 3 to 4 percent on Monday. 

					 
Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 79 cents a barrel at $48.13. Gold eased with stocks and commodities. It last traded at $1,128.40 an ounce.

VW Reportedly to Pick Porsche Head as New CEO. BERLIN - Volkswagen's supervisory board will pick the head of sports-car maker Porsche as its next chief executive to succeed Martin Winterkorn who resigned on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
 
Matthias Mueller, 62, the VW group's former head product strategist, has a majority on the 20-member supervisory panel which is due to meet on Friday, the source said. (NBC News has not confirmed Mueller's appointment.)

Winterkorn resigned after almost nine years at the helm of Europe's biggest carmaker after VW was found manipulating emission standards in diesel cars sold in the United States. Since then, shares in the world's largest carmaker by sales have plunged as much as 40 percent. 
 
The supervisory panel also will dismiss Michael Horn, the head of the company's U.S. operations, and top research and development officials at its Audi and Porsche brands, Ulrich Hackenberg and Wolfgang Hatz, respectively, on Friday, a senior source told Reuters. 
 
Mueller is a management board member of Porsche SE and so is close to the Piech-Porsche family that controls Volkswagen through the holding company. He also spent many years at Audi.

VW said on Tuesday about 11 million of its cars worldwide were fitted with the software that was found to be cheating emissions in the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said Volkswagen could face penalties of up to $18 billion.

S&P 500 

Things are getting spooky and it’s not even October yet. In the last 5 trading days the S&P 500 futures have gone from a high of 2011.75 down to 1897.25, more than 114 handles. Clearly the historical stats showing the S&P down the week after the September Quadruple Witching got a downside ‘kicker’ when Volkswagen (XETRA:VOWG) disclosed it had lied about its emissions testing. What started out as a big negative for European car companies, has now spread to the departure of several key VW board members, and has helped depress auto stocks around the world. 

It seems like there are a lot of reasons to be selling stocks right now, but VW gave people a lot more reasons to sell, and it started overnight when the headline news algos picked up on the news that Matthias Muller from Porsche was being named new VW CEO. Martin Winterkorn resigned as the company’s CEO and more resignations were expected to come from other VW principles and board members. 

The S&P futures closed down on Wednesday, opened Thursday’s globex session at 1931.75, and traded lower early in the Asian session. After a failed rally into the Euro open, the futures tanked along with the European indexes as the ESZ15 traded down to 1907.75 in globex, down about 25 handles. On the U.S. cash open, sell programs took over immediately as the index futures went from a 1913.25 open down to a low of 1897.27 in the first 90 minutes of the session, down 34 handles at its lowest point. Heading into the European close the equity markets began to rally, and continued to rally into the day’s close making a late day high of 1926.75 within 5 handles of going unchanged before settling at 1919.50, down 12 handles from Wednesday’s close. 

Last night the futures opened at 1913.25, 6 handles lower, but rallied off the open into the Asian open, and again into the Asian close\/Euro open making a high of 1951.00 shortly after 3:00 CT and is currently trading more than 10 handles off the overnight high at 1940.00, up 21 handles on the day at 6:15 am CST. 

Yesterday after the close, Janet Yellen spoke reiterating her perceived likelihood that interest rates would rise by years end. It just seems like more of the same, saying the right thing in speeches, but the Fed afraid the “pull the trigger” and commit to the rhetoric. And while CNBC is reporting that futures are higher somehow due to her speech, we think this is unfounded. It was more of the same from Yellen, no surprises, the market’s are taking her less seriously, I believe, after September’s almost unanimous vote not to raise rates. What we are seeing in the futures rally is all about Europe. The foreign markets have had their share of weighing down the U.S. indexes, first with Asia, and this week with Europe, but overnight we see a rally particularly in the Euro indexes which are holding up solid and noticeable gains after being weak the last few sessions. 

In Asia, 6 out of 11 markets closed higher (Shanghai Composite -1.60%), and in Europe 11 out of 12 markets are trading higher (DAX +2.35%) this morning. Today’s economic calendar starts with the US GDP, Corporate Profits, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard speaks on new directions in monetary policy, PMI Services, Consumer Sentient, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George speaks on the economy and monetary policy in Omaha. 

T+3 

Our View: The European auto companies have clearly weighed down on the global markets and the S&P, but it could have been worse, which brings us to to why the ESZ15 rallied so hard yesterday. The first part is like last week when the ESZ saw everyone had gone from long into the rally to short into the decline. From the 2011.75 higher to 1897.25 the ESZ has dropped 114 handles in less than 5 full trading sessions, and we were right on when we were warning about the week after the September Quadruple Witch being down. Now the question is, after such a big sell off, and the final 4 trading days of the quarter, can the S&P rally? Statistically it’s supposed to, but I am just not sure the futures will hold. 

Our view; The ES has not gone down like many thought it would over the last few Fridays, and after yesterdays up swing, we think there could be more upside coming our way. Can it continue? Sure, but not all the way into the end of the quarter. You can sell the early rallies and buy weakness, or just buy weakness when the ES pulls back. 

As always; please use protective buy and sell stops when trading futures and options.

FTSE 100 6142.10-13.71 - -. Porsche's Mueller called in to steer VW through crisis. BERLIN (Reuters) - Porsche boss Matthias Mueller once joked that he was too old to run Volkswagen but the 62-year-old now looks certain to be given the task of steering the German car maker through the worst business crisis in its history. 
 
Mueller, VW's former head product strategist, is backed by a majority on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as new CEO at a meeting on Friday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
 
The top job at VW suddenly became available this week when chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigned after the company admitted that it deceived U.S. regulators about how much its diesel cars pollute. 
 
Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying information technology, has worked for parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors in getting the job. 
 
Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW. 
 
Mueller, promoted to VW's executive board in March, had been viewed as a favorite of family patriarch Ferdinand Piech who  reportedly sought to install him as VW CEO in place of Winterkorn earlier this year. 
 
Winterkorn survived a power struggle that saw Piech himself forced to step down as company chairman and his job looked secure until the emissions scandal broke last week. 
 
Mueller, Rupert Stadler, who runs VW's Audi brand, and VW brand head Herbert Diess had been seen as the front-runners to replace Winterkorn as VW hastily sought a successor. 
 
""He is a good choice even though he may be seen as a transitory CEO until another internal candidate such as VW brand CEO Diess has earned their stripes,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. 
 
Mueller is known for a laid-back style, often appearing at car shows in a casual jumper rather than the expensively tailored suits favored by fellow executives. 
 
But he does not lack ambition. 
 
Mueller used the Frankfurt auto show this month to toss his hat into the ring to lead VW's sports-car operations as VW  adopted a new structure to boost foreign sales and profits. 
 
Those goals will have to take second place to a more basic need to rescue the Volkswagen group from a crisis that threatens to destroy its reputation for reliability and engineering excellence. 
 
Mueller made his name as product manager for Audi's successful A3 model in the 1990s. He then worked as VW's head product strategist until 2010 when he was asked to lead Porsche. 
 
Under his leadership, Porsche has expanded and expects to increase sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early. 
 
 
(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach in Stuttgart and Andreas Cremer in Berlin; Writing by Keith Weir; Editing by Giles Elgood). Shame and Degradation in Wolfsburg: The Fallout from the VW Diesel Scandal. - 
Has an automaker ever been knocked off its axis quite so dramatically as has happened with Volkswagen in the wake of it being caught cheating on diesel-engine emissions ? The company has had its head lopped off in a single strike. And by that, we don’t just mean Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down just days after a humiliating apology in which he conceded the company’s deliberate wrongdoing while trying to dispel the assumption that he knew exactly what was going on. 
- 
While we continue to wait for the full facts about who did what, it appears that a faction within VW thought they could cheat their way to passing U.S. emissions tests with engine-management software that altered emissions during the test cycle. Who came up with the idea, who approved it, and who implemented it remains to be seen. We expect this information to be revealed soon, and the implications for those involved likely will be harsh. 
- 
The apparent disregard for the American consumer sheds a bright light on VW’s inability to understand the world’s biggest market, one in which their share is a fraction of their major competitors. Coincidentally, one of former supervisory board chief Ferdinand Piëch’s main gripes about Martin Winterkorn was the latter’s lack of a plan for the United States. It turns out that while Winterkorn may have had a plan, it wasn’t necessarily a good one. 
- 

- Newly ensconced VW Group CEO Matthias Müller has a tough road ahead. - 
One thing is certain: VW can’t and won’t write off the U.S. and other North American markets; the company’s recent investment in production sites and new product in the region is vast and has yet to pay off. All eyes are now on North America, and one sign is putting heavyweight Winfried Vahland in charge of VW’s newly created North American Region (NAR). The role also secures him a seat on the VW brand’s board. (VW USA CEO Michael Horn will stay in his current role; after it had initially leaked that the supervisory board was looking to sack him, the American dealer body weighed in with a strong vote of confidence.) 
- 
Given its position at the center of the crisis, and its importance in terms of the bottom line, VW North America will gain more clout in Wolfsburg. Should Vahland navigate these waters as adeptly as his superiors hope, he will be perfectly positioned as a possible successor of newly appointed VW Group CEO Matthias Müller . 
- 
Meanwhile, the supervisory board has paved the way for a sweeping reorganization via an almost maniacal desire to sideline everyone who might be connected with the scandal. 
- 
Müller, the former Porsche CEO, has spent four decades within the VW Group, mostly at Audi, and he knows cars inside and out. He also enjoys the respect of both the workforce and the engineers. Importantly, he is thoroughly immersed in the Volkswagen Group’s corporate culture. In an official statement announcing the appointment of Müller, family honcho Wolfgang Porsche praised Müller’s achievements, including the 918 Spyder and the Macan; he also mentions the Le Mans win with the 919 Hybrid. 
- 

- Audi, Porsche, and VW R&D heads Ulrich Hackenberg, Wolfgang Hatz, and Heinz-Jakob Neusser [left to right] have been put on temporary leave. - 
Porsche might have mentioned R&D chief Wolfgang Hatz in connection with the Le Mans win, but Hatz has been put on temporary leave, along with VW R&D chief Heinz-Jakob Neusser and Audi R&D boss Ulrich Hackenberg. If their leaves become permanent, it will signal an unprecedented bloodletting of actual “car guys” within the VW Group. And more heads will roll among the slightly lower ranks. The departure of VW’s marketing chief Christian Klingler—a Piëch man—is unrelated to the scandal; the company has simply seized the opportunity. 
- 
After his appointment, Müller has said that he aims to give each brand more autonomy in each market; on the other hand, he aims to tighten brand coordination by the Group. The specifics of these seemingly contradictory aims have yet to be revealed. 
- 
We spoke to company and industry insiders to get further insights. Here are a few observations: 
- - Communications are being extremely tightly controlled by headquarters; even the usually vocal dealers are reluctant to comment, and the sub-brands—including Audi, some of whose vehicles are also caught in the scandal—are keeping a low profile. - - - The conspiracy theories that amount to the assertion that the EPA wants to hurt a German brand are baloney. The EPA is similarly harsh with American and Japanese carmakers, but it’s true that when the EPA puts its boot on a company’s throat, it won’t let off. VW has grossly underestimated the EPA’s power and inexplicably failed to go public before the story broke, despite having ample warning. - - - The involved executives need to be prepared for a legal backlash that could affect them personally and financially. - - - The diesel engine will regain its footing in the market. It’s simply indispensable around the globe—and not just to comply with CO2 emissions. And it will remain strong in the U.S., too, at least in the pickup- and commercial-truck segments. - - - Depending on the legal fallout, VW might have to kill or postpone various product plans in order to free up cash. And that would take a toll on its aspirations to cement its position as the world’s number-one automaker. - - - - Diesel Cheating Scandal Claiming Top Engineers at VW - Porsche CEO Matthias Müller to Become VW Group CEO - VW Diesel Emissions Scandal: Ongoing Coverage from Car and Driver - - - 
Perhaps most important, VW’s travails will serve as a warning to carmakers who might underestimate the U.S. government’s power—and any who underestimate the importance of preemptive damage control. Ferdinand Piëch’s observation that his successor, Winterkorn, didn’t understand the American market has proved to be correct—although even Piëch wouldn’t have wanted a rushed corporate overhaul that forces the true product guys out. But did Piëch also help lay the foundation for this scandal? When he took over as VW’s CEO in 1993, his great adversary was Daniel Goeudevert, the visionary VW brand chief who promoted green technology—against the “cast-iron” engineers. Goeudevert might enjoy the unraveling of a VW that he never would have created. 
-. UK ministers 'must come clean' over when they knew of VW scandal. UK ministers have been told to ""come clean"" on when they were first told about the Volkswagen scandal. 
 
Labour's shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood claimed the response of the Department for Transport (DfT) was ""unacceptable"". 
 
Meanwhile the car company announced Matthias Mueller as its new chief executive.  The former Porsche boss replaces Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down in the wake of the scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. 
 
Environmental group Greenpeace wrote to the Government to ask if it knew about the cheating of emissions tests before this month. 
 
The action against Volkswagen in the US began with diesel emissions research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in 2013 and 2014 which found a huge discrepancy in real-world performance and official laboratory tests. 
 
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced yesterday that diesel cars would be re-tested in the UK. 
 
Ms Greenwood said: ""Ministers must come clean and admit when they were first told about the diesel emissions scandal. 
 
""The International Council on Clean Transportation, the body which helped to expose the problem, warned a year ago that dangerously high levels of nitrogen oxide emissions were not confined to America. 
   Promoted stories   
""It is unacceptable that the Government waited this long to take action."" 
 
Greenpeace published figures which it claimed show manufacturers of diesel vehicles built to comply with European emissions standards spent up to £13.6 million lobbying EU politicians last year. 
 
Its UK executive director, John Sauven, said: ""It's time for our ministers to be completely transparent on what they knew and when about the pollution fix scandal. 
 
""Many people will want to know which matters more to our Government - the polluters' profits or the health of their citizens."" 
 
A DfT spokesman said the UK Government has been ""at the forefront of action at a European level"" to introduce updated emissions testing. 
 
He added that the ICCT report published in October last year ""did not identify the vehicles tested"". 
 
VW has admitted that 11 million vehicles worldwide were fitted with sophisticated software which conned testers in the US into believing their vehicles met environmental standards. 
 
The Environmental Protection Agency said 482,000 of the German car-maker's 2009-15 models in the US were fitted with the defeat device to switch engines to a cleaner mode when they are undergoing official emissions testing. 
 
Once on the road, the cars produced nitrogen oxide pollutants at up to 40 times the legal standard. 
 
VW has not revealed whether cars in the UK are affected but Germany's transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said 2.8 million vehicles in his country have the software. 
 
He added that VW vans as well as cars are caught up in the scandal. 
 
Mr McLoughlin said on Thursday that the Government was taking the ''unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously''. 
 
He announced that the UK regulator would investigate and re-run laboratory tests and called on the EU to conduct a Europe-wide investigation to find out if cars have been fitted with defeat devices on the continent. 
 
The British Lung Foundation urged the Government to commit to ""routine, independent real-world testing on all cars"". 
 
Mr Winterkorn resigned over the scandal but insisted he was not aware of ""any wrongdoing on my part''. 
 
According to reports the 68-year-old could receive a severance package of up to two years of his annual salary, which would be worth over £22 million. 
 
Mr Mueller's appointment as his replacement was announced after the stock markets had closed so it is not possible to say exactly how investors will take the news, though it is fair to say his appointment was widely expected. 
 
Volkswagen shares fell 4.3% to 108 euros (£80) today, meaning the carmaker has lost about a third of its value, or 26 billion euros (£19 billion), since the start of the crisis. 
 
The Volkswagen board is also expected to dismiss high-level engineers and designers, though no further details have been released yet. 
 
Mr Mueller, 62, formerly worked as VW's head product strategist, and is understood to have substantial backing among the company's 20-member supervisory board. 
 
Analysts said his first tasks at VW will be to clean out its senior management team, restructure costs and drive sales. 
 
Mr Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying IT has worked for various parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors for the top job.

He has until recently joked that he was too old to run VW, which is the largest carmaker in the world by sales. 
 
Under his leadership, Porsche has successfully added new models and is expected to boost sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early.. Porsche 918 Spyder 1700km road trip. Doomsday weather in Stuttgart. The temperature reads minus two degrees as swollen skies roll over with a mix of rain, sleet, snow and haze. Could our road trip suddenly be in jeopardy? 
 
The day before, Frank Walliser, engineer extraordinaire, had called an emergency meeting. There was no way this triple-hearted roadster could be unleashed in such adverse conditions on uncompromising low-profile summer tyres. 
 
Officially, Porsche does not offer all-season rubber for the 918 Spyder. After all, driving in sub-zero temperatures would probably refrigerate the lithium-ion batteries to premature extinction. 
 
Unofficially, however, a friend of Herr Walliser, who works in the prototype shop, produces a set of bespoke black alloys shod with brand-new Pirelli Sottozeros. New tyres fitted, the chrome blue 918 is released from the factory gates at 10:30am sharp. 
 
One could drive non-stop from Stuttgart to Valencia in just over 13 hours, but we took the 1741km scenic route which called for 22h 48min hours of wheel time. My time capsule passenger is Sebastian Rüger, a 31-year-old whizz-kid engineer who knows a lot about hybrids and practically everything about the 918. 
 
The low, wide and outlandish two-seater commences the first leg of the journey in E-Power mode. In this configuration the two electric motors, whirring a happy duet, sound unexpectedly subdued inside the cabin. 
 
In tandem, the compact power packs muster 210kW and an impressive aggregate torque of 585Nm. Depending on one’s driving style, E-Power offers a maximum zero emission range of 31km or a top speed of 150km\/h. 
 
On the feeder lane to the A81 motorway, a bomb dropped on our acoustic idyll as the V8 engine entered the scene like a bat out of hell – loud, harsh and furious. The ice-cold liquids inside the angry flat-crank, direct-injection, normally-aspirated high-revving 4.6-litre engine were evidently at odds with the under-challenging 120km\/h speed limit. 
 
Up to 3000rpm the 32-valver, which is a direct descendant of the RS Spyder power plant, sounds rough and raucous. Between 3500 and 6500rpm, petrol feed, firing order and valve timing finally agree on a more coordinated and slightly smoother rhythm and pace. 
 
But it’s only from 7000rpm to the cut-out at 9150rpm that the ‘steam hammer’ effect eventually compresses the running characteristics to a dense energetic flow. 
 
“In essence, the 918 is a street-legal track tool,” project leader Eugen Obermann says. “This statement not only applies to the drivetrain, but also to the chassis, the steering and the brakes.” 
 
Too true. The race seat makes you painfully aware of those shapely love handles, the race suspension kickboxes us with vigour through the day, the race brakes decelerate with an unashamed grinding noise. 
 
The boot (110L when the roof is in place) has race car space, rear visibility is compromised by the gills, louvres and the XXL wing, and noise levels at speed match a race car for pungency and persistence. 
 
Fuel consumption on the other hand corresponds to the drinking abilities of a compact car. We didn’t come close to the claimed 3.1L\/100km, but the observed average of 10.6L\/100km was not bad for a 345km\/h super coupé. 
 
The difference between these numbers is due to the controversial and unrealistic EU measuring cycle, obviously defined in an ivory tower by officials under the influence. 
 
Depleting a full load of E-Power is the easiest trick in the book: just ignore the detent in the throttle pedal or push the red H (for hot lap) button – and don’t forget to brace for the physical afterburner effect.  
 
Restoring energy to its 6.8kWh peak is equally simple: keep the engine spinning at medium revs for about 15 minutes in Sport – or Race – and the green dots on the dash will reassemble in full force. 
 
Lyon, France, welcomes us with ‘sleeping policemen’ – width restrictors and the tallest kerbs this side of the Eiger’s north face. Although tackling the down ramp to the hotel car park was a 13-minute nerve-wracker, we successfully complete the pole slalom to find the solitary charge point, thankfully unoccupied. 
 
While a high-speed wall charger (around A$30,500 plus installation) would have performed the act in 25 minutes, hooking the car up on (s)low-voltage household mains extended the process by four hours. 
 
The batteries always keep a 25 per cent emergency charge – in case you take an impromptu detour to the racetrack where the entire energy reservoir may be depleted at a push of the ‘H’ button. 
 
Although the E-Power reservoir was tapped whenever it made sense, we nonetheless had to make four pit stops to fill up the 70L tank with a total of 213L premium juice. 
 
The next morning, S-GO 9182 follows the river Rhone south in tip-toe fashion, elegantly swooshing past slower traffic, and soaking up applause and thumbs-up gestures. When fully charged, battery power alone can whisk the 918 from 0-100km\/h in a brisk 6.2sec. 
 
Some 19km down the road, the black box summons hybrid mode signalling that the V8 will now cut in or be phased out according to throttle orders. Not sufficiently inspiring? Twist the mode dial to Sport and try to suppress a big smile when it grabs you by the neck and glues your bum to the seat. 
 
In Race, the Porsche morphs into a real road rocket and this ultra-fast urge is matched by an even more aggressive shift strategy. The seven-speed PDK transmission hammers through the gears like a firing pin on steroids, the E motors howl breathlessly up to their ambitious redline, and the V8 bursts noisily into brief charging spells. There’s no doubt about it – this car makes concerted attacks on your senses. 
 
It dries your throat, moistens your palms, and fills your nose with the sweet smell of fast flowing electrical current. It reduces CO2 emissions by making you hold your breath in a mix of astonishment and awe. 
 
The arrow-straight and suspiciously empty Autoroute du Sud is the perfect place to check out the bespoke infotainment system. We like the comprehensive content, the quick response time, the clever ergonomics. We don’t like the reflections on the shiny screen, the marginally intuitive coordination of the two monitors, or the lack of any tactile feedback. 
 
Rolling at a steady 128km\/h through radar-infested territory, we kill time rating the sensational Burmester sound system, the authentic leather seats (are they really A$36,000 nicer than the standard cloth upholstery?), the body-colour ignition key left of the steering column (why is the wheel only adjustable in reach?), and the electric auxiliary heating (a whopping $A9000 – bum warmers are free, though). 
 
Despite the numerous extras, our 918 still lacked the heavily promoted Weissach pack, which adds a whopping A$107,700 (approximately) to the total while reducing weight by 41kg. We applaud the achievement, but a similar effect could be had with the price of a Fitness First membership. 
 
The most demanding section of the entire voyage is the winding coastal road between Perpignan and the Spanish border. Although the tarmac is narrow – bumpy and dotted with blind crests – the 918 tracks with the precision of a Strike Fighter, clings like a magnet to bitumen, and decelerates like an F1 car, only to reach out for the next straight with expandable elasticity. 
 
As soon as the hinterland opens up and the rock faces give way to rolling hills, the Porsche readily beamed us into a parallel universe with such relentless thrust, it feels like vital body fluids were beginning to boil. 
 
The 2.6sec acceleration from 0-100km\/h very nearly ends in my cardiac arrest, and when the speedo shows 200km\/h a mere 4.7sec later, adrenalin flows like a burst fire hydrant. It’s mildly terrifying. 
 
Scared by my courage, I hit the brakes and immediately wish for four-point belts, Schwarzenegger forearms and eyeballs capable of staying in their sockets. Instrumental in this mind-boggling energy squashing performance are carbon-ceramic discs the size of New York pizzas, improved Michelin tyres boasting a secret superglue compound, and the riveting recuperative performance of the hybrid brake system, which can pull up to 0.5G. 
 
The Porsche approaches Barcelona in balmy weather, so it’s high time to convert the coupé into a spyder. To keep the toupee from getting airborne, you must first attach a small double-decker drag deflector to the windscreen frame. Even with the roof stowed in the tiny cargo bay, the carbonfibre body feels as if it had been hewn from solid steel. The downside to this granite rigidity is rock hard suspension which pummels your derriere like four jackhammers. 
 
Only professional masochists, or Max Mosley, would have the balls to switch the damper calibration from ‘Have Mercy’ (standard) to ‘Last Rites’ (sport). The fast-responding front axle lift (yours for just A$13,500) on the other hand dramatically reduces the nose bleed factor. 
 
The large tail rudder will, at the push of a button, freeze in two different positions for maximum downforce or maximum speed. Even with energy packs depleted, this plug-in supercar can still top 326km\/h, but Spanish jails are almost as bad as Indonesian ones, so we didn’t even try. 
 
Zooming through tunnels at 144km\/h in third gear was enough to make the plaster crack and fall from the ceiling. 
 
We arrived at il circuito Ricardo Tormo on the northern outskirts of Valencia for 
a quick trackside lunch. In pit lane, the 918 finally shed its Dr Hyde costume for the more appropriate Jekyll livery. 
 
Sadly, all it takes to put your driving skills into perspective is one quick lap next to rallymeister, Walter Röhrl, who drives the entire lap in ‘D’ and still gets to the finish line light years before the next quickest. 
 
However, we do eventually learn to late-apex most corners, step on the gas early, anticipate the dialogue between rear-wheel dominance and front-wheel support, brake eerily deep into bends, open up steering much sooner and to look after the tyres rather than understeer into oblivion. 
 
As the track closes at 5pm, we point the Porsche’s low-slung nose toward the open road one last time. Although I am strapped to a A$1.2m spaceship, my fear factor has shrunk to 911 GT3 levels since we left Zuffenhausen barely three days ago. The 918 may not be as easy to drive as a 911 Turbo , but it certainly isn’t a razor blade on wheels either. 
 
The difference between the standard model and the Weissach edition we briefly trialled on track is marginal unless you’re a pro. Rather than spending a small fortune on fancy paint and better leather, it makes more sense to invest in higher technology which suits the character of the car very well. 
 
At no extra cost, Porsche will shrink-wrap the Spyder in matte black, Martini Racing livery or the striking Salzburg Racing design which allegedly pays tribute to a certain Porsche legend, Ferdinand Piech. 
 
Porsche intends to manufacture 918 units of the 918, but so far only two-thirds of that number have customer names attached. Is this déjà vu of the Carrera GT, which found a mere 1270 takers despite a production target of 1500 units? 
 
“No, I don’t think so,” R&D chief Wolfgang Hatz says. “First test drives have only just begun, and as soon as word gets out about the breakthrough dynamics and the unique engineering concept, the 918 will sell out quickly.” 
 
Just in case you’re in the market for one of these rare automotive dream tickets, bear in mind there are two seat sizes to choose from (small did not work well for me...), that plug-in charging really is only optional icing on the cake, and that this car is, in real life, so much more than the sum of its parts. 
 
Although it’s swollenw with technology, the 918 we lived with for half a week was not an unapproachable monster. On the contrary, it is a thrilling and surprisingly unpretentious blend of supercar, race car and vision of the future.

BERLIN - Volkswagen will name the head of sports car maker Porsche as its group chief executive on Friday to succeed Martin Winterkorn who quit over the diesel emissions scandal, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
 
Matthias Mueller, VW's former head product strategist who joined the group's top management board in March, is favoured by a majority on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as new CEO at a meeting on Friday, the source said. 
 
Winterkorn, an engineer by training who spent almost nine years at the helm of Europe's largest automaker, resigned on Wednesday, taking responsibility for the biggest business scandal in VW's 78-year history. 
 
Mueller, 62, who held various positions at VW's luxury flagship Audi before taking charge of Porsche in 2010, was also the favourite candidate for VW's top job by long-time chairman Ferdinand Piech, who quit in April after a power struggle with Winterkorn. 
 
Labour representatives, occupying half of the 20 board seats, would ""only accept a personality with great technical and entrepreneurial expertise as well as great social competence,"" VW works council chief Bernd Osterloh said in a letter to employees published on Thursday.

BERLIN - Volkswagen will name the head of sports car maker Porsche as its group chief executive on Friday to succeed Martin Winterkorn who quit over the diesel emissions scandal, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 

Matthias Mueller, VW's former head product strategist who joined the group's top management board in March, is favoured by a majority on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as new CEO at a meeting on Friday, the source said. 

Winterkorn, an engineer by training who spent almost nine years at the helm of Europe's largest automaker, resigned on Wednesday, taking responsibility for the biggest business scandal in VW's 78-year history. 

Mueller, 62, who held various positions at VW's luxury flagship Audi before taking charge of Porsche in 2010, was also the favourite candidate for VW's top job by long-time chairman Ferdinand Piech,…. BMW X5 xDrive40e – First Drive. BMW X5 xDrive40e – First Drive1 day ago	byMichael Beinenson24Comments	BMW X5 xDrive40e BMW has made several announcements in the past few weeks about upcoming PHEV models. Naturally, with the ICE engines hitting the efficiency limits, many manufacturers are turning to plug-in hybrid solutions to keep up with reduced emissions levels. The first such vehicle to hit the US market from BMW is the X5 xDrive40e model. Why 40 you might ask? Well, it is actually a 4 cylinder engine with the new BMW modular structure. It’s the same architecture as the engine in the i8, so again BMW is reaping rewards from investing billions into the i program. BMW X5 xDrive40e Although you cannot even configure or read about the new X5 on bmwusa.com, many dealers across the country began taking deliveries of demo models, and I was fortunate enough to drive one. Sure, one could point out at the EPA sticker and notice the 13-mile range is low, but when you put in context of the weight of the car, it is not too bad for a 9 kWh battery. Naturally, I started the car in MAX eDrive to experience how much torque there is in pure electric mode. To my relief, the vehicle does have about LEAF-like feel in EV acceleration, and is far better then the Porsche Cayenne I tested a year ago. X5 was driving in pure silent mode and if needed I could press the accelerator further down and the ICE engine kicked in very seamlessly. BMW X5 xDrive40e Moving on to other buttons, I decided to put the car in sport mode and was surprised to learn that the car will operate in sport mode while being in EV mode. As with the Audi A3 PHEV (tested earlier) a great unknown was whether you can shift gears in all EV mode. Compared to the Audi, the answer is no. When the ICE engine was working in tandem with the electric motor located in the gearbox, the car was accelerating very well and knowing you are doing it on a 4 cylinder engine felt good. No significant inside changes compared to the standard X5, with the exception of a new button to control EV mode. There are however some notable feature absence including: Dynamic Package, Third Row Seat and for some odd reason Park Assist. The trunk space is reduced by about an inch to fit the battery, but this reduction is not highly noticeable. BMW X5 xDrive40e With lots of competition in this segment heading to this market BMW X5 xDrive40e will be a great alternative to consider. Production has started in Spartanburg SC and you can head to the dealers to order one, or at least take it for a drive and don’t forget to plug it in after the test drive, as it takes about 3 hours at 3.7 kW rate to charge.

Porsche chief Mueller to take the wheel at VW: report. The head of German luxury sports car maker Porsche, Matthias Mueller, has been picked to succeed Martin Winterkorn as the chief executive of scandal-battered auto giant Volkswagen, the business daily Handelsblatt reported on Thursday.

In an article to be published in its Friday edition, the newspaper said 62-year-old Mueller has been chosen to take the driving seat vacated by Winterkorn on Wednesday as a consequence of the global pollution cheating scandal that has rocked the automobile sector over the past week.

Senior members of the company's supervisory board had agreed on the choice of Mueller, the report said, quoting two sources close to the board. 

The full 20-member board would meet on Friday morning to approve the appointment, which would then be made public in the early afternoon, it added.

Born in Chemnitz in former East Germany, Mueller originally trained as a tool maker and then graduated in information technology. Appointed CEO at VW's sports car maker Porsche in 2010, the white-haired and blue-eyed Mueller enjoys the backing of the group's family shareholders.

He had been tipped to replace Winterkorn during the latter's bitter feud with his one-time mentor and former supervisory board chief Ferdinand Piech earlier this year.

Germany's powerful car industry has been reeling over the revelations that Volkswagen fitted up to 11 million of its diesel cars with devices capable of fooling emissions tests.

The scandal, which emerged last Friday when US officials publicly accused the company of cheating and launched a probe, has now gone global with French and South Korean authorities also announcing investigations.. 27-Sep-2015 17:19.

Porsche's Matthias Muller to be named new CEO of Volkswagen. Volkswagen is gearing up to name Matthias Muller as its new CEO. Martin Winterkorn, the company's former CEO, resigned earlier this week following the infamous emission scandal . 

Matthias Muller has been with the Volkswagen group since the 1970s. He has been heading Porsche, the sports car brand and a part of the group, since 2010. He is believed to have the backing of the majority of the members on the 20-member supervisory board of the company and is also close to the Piech-Porsche family that control the company. 

The emission test scandal has tarnished Volkswagen's image all over the world. The company claimed that 11 million cars globally had been fitted with the ""defeat device"", which enabled them to clear pollution tests. The company now faces big fines and lawsuits. 

The 62-year old Muller will have the responsibility of guiding Volkswagen through this period of difficulty and winning back the trust of its customers and dealers. 

Many high-ranking executives are expected to be sacked in the process.

Posted Sep. 22, 2015 at 4:25 PM 

Benjamin Zhang\/Business Insider 

As Volkswagen Group's diesel emissions scandal grows to include more than 11 million cars worldwide, there are fears that the scandal has spread to other members of the VW brand family. 

Especially Porsche, the high-performance jewel-in-the-crown of the automaker. 

But the highly profitable sports car and SUV manufacturer has emerged unscathed, a company source told Business Insider. 

""Porsche conducts our own emissions testing and calibration,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not affected by VW's problem."" 

In the US, the only Porsche powered by a VW Group TDI engine is the Cayenne Diesel SUV. And it's a 3.0-liter V6, while the engines affected by the scandal are 2.0-liter 4-cylinder powerplants.. Tesla Reveals the Specs for its Invitation Only Model X: Are You Worthy?. Tesla is trying to define itself as the epitome of exclusivity, which is why one has to be invited by Tesla Motors to book one of the very first Signature Series editions of the Model X crossover. The top secret specs of this car will only be revealed to these chosen few and include a zero to 60 time of 3.8 seconds, a driving range of 240 miles and a price $100,000 plus price tag.

These specifications were revealed by a Tesla customer, who got a chance to configure the new car. The configurator is only available by invitation and comes with two driveline options: the standard 90-kWh setup, which sends 259bhp horses to the front wheels and 503bhp to the rear, and a EPA-verified range of 240 miles. In this setup the car is capable accelerating from 0-100kmph in 3.8 seconds and features a 155 mph top speed; if that doesn't tickle your fancy, then you can opt for the Ludicrous Mode upgrade, which costs around $10,000 and is an option that according to Tesla, can enhance the 0-100kmph acceleration to fall under 3.2 seconds. Considering that this is a seven-seater crossover, these statistics are immensely impressive.

Other options also include - a $750 towing package, which includes towing mode to mitigate sway, the capability of lugging up to 5000 pounds and outfitting the Model X with a two-inch hitch receiver; A Subzero Weather option, which is priced at $1000 and comes with a heated steering wheel and washer nozzles, a wiper-blade defroster and extends the heated seating to the second and third rows.

Other features of this limited-edition Model X include an Ultra High Fidelity sound system, Smart Air Suspension with GPS memory, a Premium Interior Package and Autopilot semiautonomous cruise control. This limited edition is priced at around $132,000 by Tesla, which will be roughly $25,000 more than the standard variant that is expected to hit the market soon. To book one of these limited edition beauties one would have to shell out a $40,000 deposit, while the “regular” customers get to put down a mere $5000 placeholder fee today for a delivery in the “early 2016”. 

The standard Model X, will come with Falcon Wing rear doors, which have built-in sensors for opening in garages of any height, folding third-row seats, a free charging facility on Tesla’s Supercharger network and an eight-year battery warranty with unlimited mileage. The performance specs offered by Tesla are sure to give tough competition to its other gas-powered SUV rivals like the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and the BMW X5M.. Volkswagen Unit Porsche Said to Name Oliver Blume as New Chief. Porsche’s production chief Oliver Blume is set to succeed Matthias Mueller as the new head of the Volkswagen AG unit that makes the 911 sports car, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

The appointment of Blume is to be sealed at a Porsche board meeting in the near future, said the person, who declined to be named because the talks are private. 

The change at Porsche is necessary after Mueller was named Volkswagen’s new CEO Friday, in a bid to help the Wolfsburg-based carmaker respond to its worst crisis after revelations of cheating on emissions tests. Mueller had been running Porsche since October 2010, and the maker of luxury sports cars has boosted profit 62 percent over four years. Annual deliveries are on track to surpass 200,000 vehicles for the first time this year.. New Volkswagen CEO Vows To Win Back Trust. Volkswagen has named Porsche chief Matthias Mueller as its new boss as the German car-maker deals with an emissions scandal.

Mr Mueller replaces Martin Winterkorn, who resigned this week after it was revealed VW had fitted millions of cars and vans with software which allowed them to falsely pass emissions tests.

The new CEO said that his priority is win back the trust that has been lost in the company after the scandal.

""Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do all it can to develop and implement the strictest compliance and governance standards in the whole industry,"" he vowed.

Mr Mueller said the company had a chance to emerge stronger from the crisis.

Porsche is owned by VW, and Mr Mueller, 62, has worked for parts of the group for almost four decades.

More follows.... Porsche's Mueller called in to steer VW through crisis. BERLIN (Reuters) - Porsche boss Matthias Mueller once joked that he was too old to run Volkswagen but the 62-year-old now looks certain to be given the task of steering the German car maker through the worst business crisis in its history.

Mueller, VW's former head product strategist, is backed by a majority on VW's 20-member supervisory board, which will endorse him as new CEO at a meeting on Friday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

The top job at VW suddenly became available this week when chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigned after the company admitted that it deceived U.S. regulators about how much its diesel cars pollute.

Mueller, who trained as a toolmaker before studying information technology, has worked for parts of the VW empire since the 1970s, experience that was seen as one of the decisive factors in getting the job.

Equally importantly, he enjoys the support of the Porsche-Piech family clan who own the majority of the voting rights in VW.

Mueller, promoted to VW's executive board in March, had been viewed as a favorite of family patriarch Ferdinand Piech who reportedly sought to install him as VW CEO in place of Winterkorn earlier this year.

Winterkorn survived a power struggle that saw Piech himself forced to step down as company chairman and his job looked secure until the emissions scandal broke last week.

Mueller, Rupert Stadler, who runs VW's Audi brand, and VW brand head Herbert Diess had been seen as the front-runners to replace Winterkorn as VW hastily sought a successor.

""He is a good choice even though he may be seen as a transitory CEO until another internal candidate such as VW brand CEO Diess has earned their stripes,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.

Mueller is known for a laid-back style, often appearing at car shows in a casual jumper rather than the expensively tailored suits favored by fellow executives.

But he does not lack ambition.

Mueller used the Frankfurt auto show this month to toss his hat into the ring to lead VW's sports-car operations as VW adopted a new structure to boost foreign sales and profits.

Those goals will have to take second place to a more basic need to rescue the Volkswagen group from a crisis that threatens to destroy its reputation for reliability and engineering excellence.

Mueller made his name as product manager for Audi's successful A3 model in the 1990s. He then worked as VW's head product strategist until 2010 when he was asked to lead Porsche.

Under his leadership, Porsche has expanded and expects to increase sales to 200,000 vehicles this year, hitting a long-held target three years early. 

(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach in Stuttgart and Andreas Cremer in Berlin; Writing by Keith Weir; Editing by Giles Elgood). VW appoints Matthias Müller as Chief Executive. Matthias Müller is the new Chairman of the Board of Management of the Volkswagen Group. 
 
VW’s 20-member board of management elected the Porsche Chairman and VW board member at its meeting on 25 September. 
 
Müller has long been tipped for the role – referred to more commonly as Chief Executive – and was reportedly Ferdinand Piech’s choice for Chief Executive during the April 2015 boardroom clash when the former VW Group Chairman tried to oust Martin Winterkorn as Chief Executive. 
 
An engineer and VW Group insider, Müller has an impressive track record at Porsche, which he has led since October 2010. His formal titles at Porsche were: Member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, President of the Executive Board of Porsche AG and Member of the Executive Board of Porsche Automobil Holding SE. 
 
Müller will continue in his capacity as Chief Executive at Porsche until a successor has been appointed. Müller remains a member of the board of Volkswagen AG – his current contract is valid until the end of February 2020. 
 
Müller’s career within the Volkswagen group began with an apprenticeship at Audi after completing high school, and he has worked at various divisions of the Group ever since. 
 
Mueller’s appointment brings some calm to the crisis engulfing Volkswagen, a week after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the VW Group with Notice of Violation (NOV) for the use of a ‘defeat device’ to produce favourable emissions results under test conditions.

WOLFSBURG, Germany, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Volkswagen
 knows it will take much more than just new
leadership and a corporate overhaul to clear the air after it
was caught cheating in U.S. diesel emissions tests. 
    
Beyond the measures announced by the German carmaker on
Friday, VW executives, customers, investors and workers alike
are struggling to divine what lies ahead. 
    
The new chief executive, 62-year-old Matthias Mueller, until
now head of the Porsche sports-car division, faces a host of
problems that had already been looming before the diesel scandal
broke and may now be worsened by its repercussions. 
    
Not least among these is falling profitability at the VW
brand, but the immediate priority will be to clean up the mess
in the United States, whose potential impact on the company has
been compared to the 2010 BP oil spill.
  Continued.... Frankfurt Motor Show - New Porsche 911 goes turbo >. PORSCHE HAS LIFTED the wraps from its new facelifted 911 ahead of its public unveiling at next week's Frankfurt Motor Show. And as expected, the German sportscar giant has switched to turbocharged engines. 


Without question, the biggest news is the adoption of the new turbocharged engine range. The entry-level 911 Carrera ditches the 3.4-litre flat-six for a newly developed 3.0-litre twin-turbo flat-six, which brings a 20bhp power boost to 365bhp. 


The Carrera S keeps the same engine but with modifications to boost power to 414bhp. Both cars take 4.2 and 3.9 seconds respectively to get from 0-62mph – two-tenths faster than before. 


While the new engine has a 7500rpm rev limit, Porsche is understandably keen to emphasise the traditional flat-six character hasn’t been lost. 


As you would expect, the arrival of turbocharging is primarily to boost efficiency, with PDK-equipped Carreras now capable of up 38.2mpg with CO2 emissions of 169g\/km. 


Externally, as you would expect, there are only subtle design tweaks: the main focus has been beneath the skin. 
 
Related: See more photos of the new facelifted 2016 Porsche 911 


Afficianados will note the new headlamps — which now feature four-point LED daytime running lights — and reshaped air intakes are the big changes, while at the back there's designed rear lamps and a new rear engine cover. 


Inside the cabin, the facelifted 911 gets the updated Porsche Communication Management (PCM) touchscreen infotainment system, now with Wi-Fi and Apple Carplay. 


And buyers who opt for the Sport Chrono package get a new four-mode switch rotary knob on the steering wheel, inspired by 918 hypercar. This allows drivers to configure their own vehicle setup, with adjustments on Porsche’s Active Suspension Management (PASM), the PDK transmission and sports exhaust possible. 


Porsche has also added a new ‘Sport Response’ button. This prepares the drivetrain for 20 seconds of maximum acceleration, by selecting the optimum gear and adjusting the engine management for better response. 


Amongst the other technology on the latest 911, there's adaptive cruise control with a coasting function that can also brake when going downhill to keep you at your pre-set speed. A post-collision braking system is standard, while lane-change assist is optional. 


The latest 911 now starts at £76,412 and rises to £94,698 for the Carrera S Cabriolet, which is an increase of around £2,500 over the outgoing model.

Jim McGill. Porsche chief to take over at VW. The head of German luxury sports carmaker Porsche, Matthias Mueller, has been picked to succeed Martin Winterkorn as the chief executive of scandal-battered auto giant Volkswagen.

In an article to be published on Friday, the business daily Handelsblatt claims 62-year-old Mr Mueller has been chosen to take the driving seat vacated by Mr Winterkorn on Wednesday.

Mr Winterkorn resigned as a consequence of the global pollution cheating scandal that has rocked the automobile sector over the past week.

Senior members of the company's supervisory board had agreed on the choice of Mueller, the report said, quoting two sources close to the board.

The full 20-member board would meet on Friday morning to approve the appointment, which would then be made public in the early afternoon, it added.

Germany's powerful car industry has been reeling over the revelations that Volkswagen fitted up to 11 million of its diesel cars with devices capable of fooling emissions tests.

The scandal, which emerged last Friday when US officials publicly accused the company of cheating and launched a probe, has now gone global with French and South Korean authorities also announcing investigations.. The Initially Depressing but Ultimately Exhiliarating Future of the Sports Car. ​ I might as well come out and say it: Porsche's recently-unveiled decision to go with an all-turbo lineup in the 911 has depressed me a lot more than it reasonably should. Not that I had any plans to replace my 1995 Carrera, mind you. In fact, I don't think anybody who owns a 993 is in the market for a new model; half of us refuse to accept the existence of water-cooled Porsches and the other half is too poor to be permitted over the threshold of any import-brand dealership, with the possible exception of Kia, and that's assuming they're still running that Sell-a-Thon on the Rio.   
- Continue Reading Below 

It's just that Porsche had finally gotten around to putting a great engine in the standard 911 again, back in 2009 or thereabouts. It's a very nice and very trouble-free ""closed-deck"" design and I've really enjoyed it in every 911 I've driven. In high-output trim and paired with the seven-speed manual, as with the Carrera GTS we just tested at Carolina Motorsports Park, it's everything you could want from a street 911 motor and then some. Fast, characterful, flexible, and it sounds great, too. 

So why ditch it for turbo engines that make better numbers and go slightly faster under controlled conditions but which almost certainly won't have that same analog rush to the redline? Porsche says it's for emissions and economy, and I believe them. Ferrari's doing it too, with the 488GTB. Yet as a bitter old Gen-Xer I have to wonder: why, exactly, do Porsche and Ferrari have to pretend to give a damn about economy and emissions performance?  

Think about it. Your obnoxious co-worker's McMansion was built without the slightest pretense of energy efficiency. It sits on a golf course that is an utter master class on how to waste acres of space and millions of gallons of water. Perhaps he also uses a fractional jet membership to visit other golf courses, burning thousands of dollars' worth of Jet-A in an afternoon so he can walk around a manicured lawn that is slightly different than the one outside his home. His daughter, and your daughter, and all their friends, all demand a new iPhone every six months and nobody really cares what the factories that make them do to the environment or what throwing the old iPhone into the landfill does to our drinking water. 

Of all the objects we use in our daily lives, only the automobile is truly expected to suffer in perpetuity for its ecological doubleplusungoodcrimethink. My God, for three dollars I can buy a bag of razors and use each one of them like four times and just pitch it in the trash when I'm done. Why it is that I can buy twenty pounds of plastic razors a year but Porsche has to geld the 911 in order to satisfy the unelected bureaucrats of the European Union? What if I could arrange to shave with a straight razor and sharpen it myself and keep it for like ten years? Could I, at that point, have a 2017 Carrera GTS that is just like the 2015 Carrera GTS, only maybe with more logical satellite-radio controls? 

Here's the worst part, and I swear to you that I will be proven right on this: it will all be for naught, in the long run. You cannot successfully appease the tyranny of the environmentalists any more than Neville Chamberlain could wheedle and kneel his way out of the Anschluss. More concessions will be necessary, and the pace at which the goalposts are moved – the rate of change, the acceleration of aggression towards our beloved internal combustion -- will increase until it cannot be satisfied. In the long run, we will be confined to vomit-colored plastic transportation modules and if your behavior is exceptionally deferential towards your betters you may be granted a transparent roof so you can watch them fly overhead. 

What's likely to happen between the 911-that-dare-not-speak-its-turbo-name and the day that SkyNet becomes conscious and decides to wipe us all out? Well, there are some additional gains to be had in the efficiency of the performance automobile. The next big change is probably the standardization of the electric supercharger , which should let small four-cylinder engines spin big turbos and make big power while also operating in fuel-saving mode when the EPA (or similar) is watching. Engines are just air pumps, after all, and if you can get enough air in a smaller engine, you can downsize the whole assembly, save weight, and reduce unboosted idling consumption. 

An electrically-boosted engine would make a great partner for a CVT, you know. LJK Setright once noted that the turbocharger and the automatic transmission were made for each other, because ""one is at work when the other is not."" A four-hundred-horsepower one-liter triple boosted to epic levels by multiple methods might not be the most, you know, natural-feeling engine in the world, so it's best to just let it immediately spin to max power and let the transmission handle the business of accelerating the car. As with dual-clutch gearboxes, we will hear a lot of truthful but irrelevant blather about how much faster a setup like this is, and as with the dual-clutch gearboxes there will be a depressing reduction in the quality of our interaction with the car as a result.  

Of course the aforementioned micro-engine will just be a part of a synergistic assembly of batteries and capacitors and electric motors. There will be a lot of menu screens and power displays and aftermarket hacks. Just accelerating from a stoplight will require the kind of high-computation coordination that used to be reserved for supercolliders and running full-motion flight simulators. In the unlikely event that something breaks, a friendly popup will tell you to return your performance car to the local dealer for nano-disassembly and replacement with something just like it, but slightly newer.  

This so-called progress, coupled with the bizarre determination of modern auto designers to burden every production automobile with the ride height and suspension tuning of a 1980 AMC Eagle, will ensure that the 911 eventually becomes identical to the Macan and may possibly just become a trim level of the Macan. But there is some hope to be had, out there on the edge of possibility.  

When the bureaucrats are totally satisfied that all personal transportation has been completely subjugated into the meekest compliance possible with their demands for steady-state economy and minimal CO2 emissions and suppository-shaped repugnance -- when the most enthusiast-oriented automobile for sale in the world is some sort of tape-and-stripe package on a battery-powered crossover – then, and only then, will they turn their thoughts elsewhere, quiet in conscience, calm in their right, confident their ways are best.  

At that point, it will be possible to perhaps get some sort of hobbyist exemption for a vehicle that is used on a very occasional basis to burn whatever fossil fuel hasn't been reserved for the Gulfstreams of the elite. And with the 3-D printing and advanced scanning technologies of the future, it will be possible to build whatever engine you can copy, or imagine, for the cost of materials. Perhaps you'd like that old air-cooled 911 engine, or perhaps you'd like a Mazda triple-rotor, or perhaps you'd like to dream up your own V-16. Just fire up the assembly machines and it will be done before you know it.  

Oh, for that Sunday of the distant future when the constructors come out to play! To be there and to see the inline-six motorcycles, the flat-eight mid-engined racers, every sort of mechanical dream given form and weight. No concessions to efficiency or even normality. And perhaps, too, there will be an open road, an abandoned racetrack, a twisty two-lane to nowhere. A Society For Creative Automotive Anachronism. Maybe, just maybe, what we enthusiasts need isn't for the general public and the exotic manufacturers to fight the system. Maybe we just need them to give up, so we can get on with the business of doing it for ourselves.. VW communications chief may resign on Wednesday: sources. BERLIN Volkswagen's communications chief may resign later on Wednesday, sources told Reuters, following departed Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn as Europe's largest automaker grapples with the fallout of cheating diesel emissions tests. 

Stephan Gruehsem, head of group communications, external and investor relations at Wolfsburg-based VW who joined the carmaker in 1999, is expected to quit his post, two sources familiar with the matter said. 

The 53-year-old former journalist became head of communications at VW's flagship brand Audi in 2002 when Winterkorn became CEO of the luxury carmaker. When Winterkorn was named CEO of VW in 2007, Gruehsem took over as group communications chief. 

VW declined to comment. 
 
Winterkorn resigned last Wednesday, taking responsibility for the German group's rigging of U.S. diesel emissions tests which has plunged the carmaker into its biggest business-related scandal in its 78-year history. 
 
VW's supervisory board last Friday appointed Matthias Mueller, head of sports-car maker Porsche, as Winterkorn's successor. Mueller's communications chief Hans-Gerd Bode will replace Gruehsem as new head of VW group communications, two sources said. 

Porsche production chief Oliver Blume will head the sports-car maker from Oct. 1. 
 
(Reporting by Paul Ingrassia, Jan Schwartz and Ilona Wissenbach.; Writing by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Noah Barkin and Mark Potter ). Can new boss Matthias Muller save VW from choking on its own fumes?. Update: 17:45

VW have appointed Porsche boss Matthias Muller as CEO, as expected. At a press conference the emissions scandal was labelled a 'moral and political disaster' (you don't say...) and an extraordinary shareholder meeting was called for November 9.

So what did her have to say for himself? 'My most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group – by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency,' Muller said in an official statement. You can read the rest of it here - that was the easy part, as MT explains below.

Update: 17.00

The (still-unconfirmed - anyone would think it's a Friday night and they're expecting people to be out on the lash) new boss' job is only getting harder, as authorities around the world tighten the noose around the carmaker. Germany's transport minister has said 2.8 million vehicles in VW's home country have been affected by the 'illegal' fake emissions tests, which Bloomberg is reporting was directed from its Wolfsburg hq. 

VW's shares fell another 4.32% today to €107.30 (£79) and have now lost more than a third of their value over the scandal.

The new head of Germany’s largest manufacturer is expected to be the current boss of Porsche, Matthias Muller. But the appointment will not be made official until after today’s board meeting at the firm’s Wolfsburg HQ.

There’s plenty for them to talk about – what with VW suddenly finding itself public enemy number one in the eyes of US regulator the EPA, having admitted selling 11 million diesels globally with emissions-dodging software installed – so the meeting could be a long one. All the same MT would love to be a fly on the wall. Not least because what was a long-planned gathering of the clans intended to anoint ex-CEO Martin Winterkorn for another five years, has now ironically been co-opted for a very different purpose. A week is a long time in business, not just in politics.

Winterkorn – who resigned on Weds – is unlikely to be the only casualty either. More heads are expected to roll today, the three hot favourites for defenestration being the firm’s US boss, the head of R&D at Audi and Porsche’s engine chief.

VW’s top team will be hoping that such prompt action will be enough, if not to stop the scandal in its tracks, then at least to apply to brakes and allow them to regain some control of the situation. But the likelihood is that it will not, and that a much more significant restructure of VW’s famously idiosyncratic ownership and management structure may eventually be required.

From a governance point of view (bear with us, this is much more interesting than it sounds), VW’s issue is that despite its size and the variety of stakeholders involved, it is essentially a family business. This is because of the highly-unusual disparity between economic stakes held and voting rights at VW. 

Here goes on a quick shareholder run-down. Porsche Holdings owns a 31% stake but is in de facto control with almost 51% of the voting rights. (In turn 50% of Porsche Holdings is owned by the Porsche and Piech families - hence the family business tag). The State of Lower Saxony owns 12% but has 20% voting rights, and Qatar Holdings owns 15% but has 17% of the votes. Other minority holders account for 40% of the shares but only 12% of the votes.

To say the least this is a pretty unusual set up by global standards. And as we know from previous scandals, large international shareholders and markets generally only tolerate such ‘special’ arrangements grudgingly, and while things are going well.

Before the crisis wiped over 30% off their value, VW’s share were already trading at a substantial discount in regard to forward earnings than those of more conventionally-arranged rivals. When there’s trouble - and boy is there trouble for VW right now - the pressure to make radical changes in order to conform rises dramatically. Even the political protection historically afforded VW by a jealous German government may be weakening.

Furthermore, the family influence can cut both ways. Stability can be a good thing, but not if groupthink is allowed to flourish as outsiders with novel and necessary new thinking are not welcomed. It may be no co-incidence that Dieselgate has blown up during a period when Winterkorn and his former mentor, VW patriarch Ferdinand Piech, were at loggerheads over the future leadership of the firm.

Such power struggles can be hugely distracting. (Although they will probably continue - it has long been an ambition of the Porsche family to have a . Today they may get their wish).

So the longer term questions are, do any of VW’s current leaders retain sufficient credibility to carry on, and will the firm have to bow to international pressure to reform its entire structure?

Whoever ends up taking over the hot seat, faces one of the sternest tests of CEO succession around. Fingers crossed they are up to the task.

Volkswagen AG appointed Porsche brand chief Matthias Mueller as chief executive officer as the German carmaker reels from the biggest crisis in its history. 

The supervisory board, which met for seven hours on Friday, named four-decade company veteran Mueller to replace Martin Winterkorn, who quit Wednesday as the diesel cheating scandal widened and countries around the globe announced investigations. Mueller will lead Porsche as well until a successor is found. 

“My most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group - by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation, Mueller said in a statement. “Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do everything it can to develop and implement the most stringent compliance and governance standards in our industry. 

” 

The 62-year-old Porsche chief takes charge a week after VW was found to have cheated on diesel-emission tests in the U.S. beginning in 2009, triggering billions in potential fines and a U.S. criminal investigation. The crisis wiped about 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) off VW’s market value this week, and the company estimates irregularities on diesel-emission readings extend to 11 million vehicles around the world. 

Winfried Vahland will take over a newly created position with responsibility for all of North America. Michael Horn will remain as the U.S. chief and report to him. Vahland currently runs the Skoda division and prior to that was responsible for the automaker’s operations in China. Horn at an event on Monday in New York apologized profusely for what VW had done, saying: “We have totally screwed up. 

” 

“We need a climate where problems aren’t hidden,” Bernd Osterloh, VW’s top labor leader said at a press conference in Wolfsburg, Germany. “Volkswagen needs a fundamental cultural change. 

” 

VW shares closed down 4.85 euros on Friday, bringing their loss for the week to 34 percent. 

The supervisory board also announced that Hans Dieter Poetsch, who is currently the finance chief, will, as previously planned, become chairma…. New Volkswagen CEO Vows To Win Back Trust. Volkswagen has named Porsche chief Matthias Mueller as its new boss as the German car-maker deals with an emissions scandal. 
 
Mr Mueller replaces Martin Winterkorn, who resigned this week after it was revealed VW had fitted millions of cars and vans with software that allowed them to falsely pass emissions tests. 
 
The new CEO said that his priority is win back the trust that has been lost in the company after the scandal. 
 
""Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do all it can to develop and implement the strictest compliance and governance standards in the whole industry,"" he vowed. 
 
Mr Mueller said the company had a chance to emerge stronger from the crisis. 
 
Porsche is owned by VW, and Mr Mueller, 62, has worked for parts of the group for almost four decades.

 © 2015 Sky News, all rights reserved. CBI warning over renewables subsidies. Image copyright PA The government’s wholesale cuts to renewable energy subsidies are sending a worrying sign to investors, says employers' group, the CBI.
The head of the group, John Cridland, said firms must be given confidence that ministers really mean to tackle climate change.
The government cut subsidies in the summer because the £7.6bn budget had been exceeded.
Ministers say they are committed to protecting the climate.
They said they would announce replacement renewables policies soon.
Critics say new policies can’t come quickly enough. Mr Cridland said: ""The green economy is an emerging market in its own right, brimming with opportunity.
""Yet, with the roll-back of renewables policies and the mixed messages on energy efficiency, the government risks sending a worrying signal to businesses.
""We need all countries to pull in the same direction at the Paris Climate Summit (in November) to give firms the certainty and confidence they need to invest in the green economy for the long run"".Tax deterrent? The former Treasury chief economist Lord Stern warned: “The test is coming. In the coming few months, will policies be put in place that take account of the great cost of emissions and air pollution?
""If there are not policies, that would be deeply worrying... we are subsidising hydrocarbons big time.” Critics are also complaining that recent tax changes will actually deter people from taking decisions that help the climate.
The chancellor, for instance, shifted Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) so a Porsche pays as much as a Prius – a decision the AA said would lead to drivers using more polluting cars.
He also placed a £3.9bn carbon tax – the Climate Change Levy – on wind and solar power and biogas, which emit no net carbon. Lord Stern told BBC News it was “potty” to put a carbon tax on renewables. His Stern Review in 2006 found that cutting CO2 emissions immediately was far cheaper than paying later to solve problems in a heating world.
The author has since concluded that he underestimated the costs of burning hydrocarbons because he did not include the health costs caused by air pollution from vehicles and industry.
He said the case for low-carbon development taking climate and air pollution into account was “inarguable”.Optimal system
A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""Our support has already driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly. As costs continue to fall it becomes easier for parts of the renewables industry to survive without subsidies.""
She said any loss UK renewable generators faced would be small compared with other financial support they received from government.
Defending the decision to impose a carbon tax on green energy, she added that it was right to incentivise the efficient use of renewable power as it would supply 30% of UK electricity in 2020.
Prof Richard Tol, from Sussex University, told BBC News that Lord Stern’s idea of calculating the costs of air pollution alongside the costs of climate damages was appealing – but the sum was simply too complicated, with too many imponderable judgements and values involved.
He said: “A switch from petrol to diesel, for instance, is good for carbon dioxide emissions but bad for particulate emissions. Filters and scrubbers on power plants are good for acid rain but bad for climate change. “A switch from traditional biomass to fossil fuels is good for indoor air pollution but bad for greenhouse gas emissions. Dearer energy is good for the environment but bad for development. “Unfortunately, taking a holistic view of energy is not how we organise policy and certainly not how we organise research. We can confidently say that the current energy system is sub-optimal, but we cannot begin to answer the question what the optimal energy system would look like.”
Follow Roger on Twitter.. Volkswagen diesel scandal: Why it's so much worse than it looks for VW. The headlines look bad for VW. But the numbers look a whole lot worse. 

VW names Matthias Mueller as CEO Pretend you are a director of VW at yet another emergency board meeting. Over the weekend, Switzerland has announced a ban on the sale of all VW's, affecting 180,000 unsold cars and trucks.

That doesn't really even seem to matter, since your company has already suspended US and European sales of the mainstay of its range, the 2.0 litre TDI diesel. Last year VW sold 2.44 million diesel cars, or 25 per cent of its total output (including petrol and electric).

But as serious as the diesel problem is, the main game here is so much larger, for two reasons.

First, it's not just a question about VW's diesel, but whether the diesel engine itself has a commercial future. Or is this the moment the global auto industry uses to do a hard reboot and shift to electric, greenlighting the electric car for the mainstream? We'll get to that in a minute.

First, the board meeting. VW is a family of brands – Skoda, Audi, SEAT, Bentley (the 4WD turbo diesel Bentley Bentayga is already set for release this year) and even Porsche. (Yes, Porsche. It sells a diesel 4WD the engine for which may have come from VW.)

Did I mention that Porsche also owns 30 per cent of the voting equity of VW? In fact, there are two Porsche family representatives just across the VW board table. They look very uncomfortable. What now?

Forget the recriminations, and who knew what when, and assume the sackings, fines and custodial sentences are a given. The central question you are gathered around to answer is: what now?

As a board member, you will hear argument that the company must continue with the diesel, because the shareholders (including the director, seated to your left, representing the government of the German state of Lower Saxony, which has a 20 per cent voting interest) are demanding their dividend, which they use for public works including schools and hospitals. The Porsche family may be agreeing, although it could just be the light.

At the same time you will be aware of tens of thousands of workers and their families who are facing financial losses in part from possibility of job cuts, and second from the fall in the value of VW stock.

You all agree that pressing on with diesel is the best course of action. The question is how?

The balance sheet shows VW has around €351 billion ($560 billion) in total assets deployed around the world, manufacturing, assembling, distributing, maintaining and financing cars.

Of that, VW has €44 billion ($70.1 billion) in property plant and equipment. You will have to decide how much of this to write off and then put a number to what will be a multi-billion Euro amount to re-tool the asset base to bring diesel up to the lied-about specification, or at least to that of other diesel car makers. Sales slump

For the next couple of years, you will have to get used to sales which could be 75 per cent of what they were. Profit structures being what they are, this could cut earnings by more than half, before the write-offs, which will run for years.

One very important issue will be whether the other makers have been cheating as well. If they haven't then VW could copy their technology and compete head to head.

But if the others manufacturers have been cheating – and remember this is a distinct possibility given that the problem has been going on for ten years – then the cheating could be industry wide.

It is here the current thinking on diesel needs to be factored in.

There have been a rash of serious complaints in Europe and the US about diesel in the past few years – for example Kings College London is claiming 5800 premature deaths from emissions, while the US is claiming 10 times that figure.

All this time the electric car will be gaining traction. By which is meant charging stations, the global re-think about what a car needs to be (who needs 500 kilometre range when most trips are to the shops?) carbon pricing and of course China, the car industry for which is going global and electric as fast as it can.

Meanwhile the value of Tesla, at $US33 billion ($47 billion), is already more than half that of VW and it only sells 1 per cent of the cars. Why bother retooling for diesel to arrive at the same time the electric car has gone mainstream, either by government degree (because of emissions) or consumer taste. Significant liability

And now we get to the second issue. Buried in the VW accounts is a finance book with €135 billion in liabilities. The assets backing these liabilities will be pretty much entirely vehicles, the value of which has just fallen very significantly. (If you bought a VW diesel yesterday, you are already looking at a much larger drop to resale value than you bargained for. Multiply that out and it's a hefty class action).

So as well as a car maker, VW is also virtually a bank, requiring a portion of its book to be written off too. There may be questions about bail-outs. It is a dead certainty that Angela Merkel will soon be addressing the board in her official capacity. This just keeps getting worse.

Europe Stocks Drop as China Industrial Data Renews Growth Fears. (Bloomberg) -- The optimism that sent European stocks rallying on Friday was short-lived. 

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.3 percent at 8:13 a.m. in London. Growth concerns resurfaced after Chinese industrial companies reported profits fell the most in at least four years. Automakers, which had their worst week since 2011, fell further. 

Bullishness had swept through European markets on Friday, with the Stoxx 600 rallying 2.8 percent, the most in almost a month, after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled recent market turmoil won’t derail the U.S. recovery. Yet the gains weren’t enough to erase a second consecutive weekly decline. Europe’s benchmark measure fell 16 percent from this year’s record in April through Friday and reached an eight- month low on Thursday. 

Concerns over global growth have begun to hit corporate profits. Cuts to earnings estimates outnumber increases by the most in three years, and the pessimism could reach levels last seen during the financial crisis, based on an index tracking the changes compiled by Citigroup Inc. 

In Spain, where equities entered a bear market last week, the IBEX 35 Index was little changed. Catalan voters narrowly rejected the regional president’s plan to build an independent state and left him needing a deal with an anti-capitalist party that rejects the rule of law if he wants to govern.

8,toyota,"The Avensis is now more alluring. Have your say IT is expected that a massive 87 per cent of Toyota Avensis sales will go to the fleet and business market but I anticipate that the interest of private owners will increase now that the Derbyshire factory has just launched a new Avensis writes Bryan Longworth.

For while the new car is still aimed firmly at fleet and business customers I feel that more private motorists considering models like the VW Passat and Ford Mondeo will now show added interest in the new Toyota because it would make an ideal family car in my opinion especially following the launch of the latest model.

For the new Avensis has been given added all round appeal with more style that looks really good especially up front where as with the new Auris the re-styled family face has provided the car with much more street appeal than the previous rather bland model.

Because of these changes I feel that the elegant new Avensis especially the saloon I have just been testing will now appeal more to private owners as it will to those fleet and business users who will be pounding the motorways in the latest model which is an ideal car for long distance trips especially.

On test was the Avensis Business Edition Plus 1.6L D4D four door manual powered by a 1.6-litre diesel engine priced at £23,795 - the Business Edition Plus adds leather seats, excellent LED headlamps, front cornering fog lights, sat nav and an eight inch touchscreen multimedia system.

The 110bhp engine which delivered power to the front wheels through a six speed manual gearbox produced a top speed of 115mph with zero to 62mph taking 11.4 seconds and a combined fuel consumption of 67.3mpg with CO2 emissions of 109g\/km.

The new engine provided relaxing driving and I liked the updated and very comfortable interior especially the instruments, switchgear and the very easy to see and use colour information screen that also includes audio controls.

The only exception was the electronic parking brake control which is hidden below and to the left of the steering wheel where it was difficult to locate and a much better location for it would have been on the central console next to the gear shift.

At the rear the 509 litre boot provides plenty of load space with a space saver spare wheel underneath and the load area is easily accessed especially for placing large suitcases in it and removing them.

The test car which looked rather cool in its dark blue paintwork was extremely well equipped with standard kit that included pre collision system with autonomous emergency braking, road sign assist, lane departure warning and automatic high beam.

It was nice to drive a saloon again and I would recommend the 1.6-litre diesel unit to any potential buyer be they private company or fleet because it was economical, smooth, quiet and perfectly up to the job of hauling the latest Avensis in all driving situations.

As I mentioned earlier the new Avensis should have more appeal to private buyers than previous models because of its added style appeal plus the five year warranty which all add up to a very good package that is now a tempting alternative to those aforementioned competitors and others. Model: Toyota Avensis Business Edition Plus 1.6L D4D saloon.. Race Strategy Pays Off for Greg Biffle Crew Chief Matt Puccia with Top-5 Finish and MOOG® 'Problem Solver' Honors at Loudon. Southfield, Michigan, September 29, 2015.Matt Puccia, crew chief for the No. 16 Kleen Performance Products Ford Fusion, rolled the dice by keeping his driver, Greg Biffle, on the track while other teams were opting for fuel and new tires in the final 85 laps of Sunday's Sylvania 300 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Loudon, N.H. The gamble paid off as the 16 car had just enough fuel to coast over the finish line in fourth place. Following the race, Puccia received the prestigious ""Problem Solver of the Race"" crew chief award from MOOG ® , the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Roush-Fenway Racing-owned 16 car, which started 25 th , improved by a race-high 0.389-seconds per lap in earning its third top-five finish of 2015. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
    
Biffle was running 15 th with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the final green-flag segments to finish in the top five. 
 
""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn't have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""Matt absolutely nailed their chassis setup for the final 100 laps. Greg was running on old rubber but was still able to fight off challenges from several drivers."" 
 
Puccia's weekly Problem Solver win - his first - leaves the top of the standings unchanged in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. With eight races remaining, Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Seven crew chiefs have two wins apiece. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

HUG#1955450. Arabia Taxi expands Toyota Camry Hybrid fleet for greener Dubai operations. : Al-Futtaim Motors, exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE, today announced the handover of the first 50 Toyota Camry Hybrid to Arabia Taxi, a franchisee of RTA Dubai and member of Arabia Holdings Group of companies.

The agreement was signed by Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Motors, and Mr. P.S.M Habibullah, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Arabia Holdings, at the launch ceremony that was attended by Dr. Yousef Al Ali, Chief Executive Officer, Public Transport Agency at Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) and a number of senior officials from both organizations.

“Our relationship with Arabia Taxi spans over a decade, with more than 98% of their fleet now consisting of Toyota vehicles. The addition of Camry Hybrid vehicles to their fleet will ensure that Arabia Taxi futureproofs their transport solutions, while increasing reliance on renewable resources in their efforts to create a greener environment,” said Saud Abbasi.

Mr. P.S.M Habibullah, confirmed the alignment of Arabia Taxi's vision with RTA's to contribute to a greener environment, and explained how the new vehicles will support this vision while at the same time, helping the company provide better services to its customers.

“In addition to supporting government initiatives aiming at reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to a greener environment, we expect some serious cost savings resulting from lower fuel consumption and maintenance charges. It is a very positive cycle that will allow us to deliver better results to our customers while meeting our green agenda,” Habibullah confirmed.

Dr. Yousef Al Ali, Chief Executive Officer, Public Transport Agency at Roads and Transport Authority., said: “The RTA has been working closely with Al-Futtaim Motors for half a decade to explore the feasibility of a Hybrid Taxi fleet powered by Toyota vehicles, in line with the Dubai Vision 2021 initiative of reducing pollution from transport. The pilot study was successfully completed, and we are pleased to welcome on-board Arabia Taxi who have added 50 Toyota Hybrid Camry vehicles to their fleet, working closely with us to meet a sustainable transport future as part of our Dubai 2021 strategy.”

Arabia Taxi joins a number of operators and government institutions that have chosen the Toyota Camry Hybrid to be an integral part of their fleet in an effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and as part of the plan for a more sustainable UAE.

Camry Hybrid offers expansive savings on maintenance costs when compared to traditional fuel-powered vehicles, as it enjoys a lower total cost of ownership thanks to a great reduction in fuel consumption, wear and tear and decreased service requirements.

Globally, cumulative Toyota hybrid vehicles sales have surpassed 8 million, resulting in approximately 58 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions—believed to be a cause of global warming—than would have been emitted by gasoline-powered vehicles of similar size and driving performance. Toyota also estimates that its hybrid vehicles have saved approximately 22 million kiloliters of petrol, enough to fill 8,800 Olympic swimming pools, compared to the amount used by gasoline-powered vehicles of similar sizes.

Hybrid remains Toyota's core technology in its development of alternative powertrains. Recent developments include the release of Mirai - the world's first production hydrogen fuel-cell sedan - in Japan, the US and Europe.. VW Emissions Scandal: Motor Industry Reaction. Car manufacturers including Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot reassure customers their vehicle emissions tests comply with…  
Car manufacturers and regulatory bodies have been reacting to the Volkswagen emissions testing controversy, which could have affected around 11 million cars worldwide. 

Here are their responses: 

""Toyota does not engage in any practice that would seek to enhance emissions performance of its engines during regulated emissions testing or homologation cycles, nor does it use any practice that would make engine performance different during these tests."" 

:: Vauxhall 

""GM and its brands are committed to the robust emissions compliance of all our vehicles. 

""Specifically, we do not have ""defeat devices"" in vehicles we engineer and manufacture. 

""We expect our employees to be informed and act legally and ethically, without exception."" 

:: PSA Peugeot Citroen 

""PSA's Research & Development Department reaffirms that PSA complies with the approval procedures in effect in all countries where it operates, and that engine settings, assuming the same conditions of use, are identical whether for approval procedures or in real life. 

""Further, PSA notes that the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system installed on all its Euro 6 diesel vehicles produces variances that are among the lowest in the automotive industry between approved emissions and those arising from customer use."" 

:: Daimler (Mercedes-Benz) 

""We heard of the EPA's [US Environmental Protection Agency] accusations against VW from the press. 

""The issue described by the press does not apply to Mercedes-Benz Cars."" 

:: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders 

""The UK automotive industry understands the concerns consumers may have following the actions of one manufacturer in regard to emissions testing and the subsequent decision to recall a large number of its cars. 

""This is, however, an issue affecting just one company and there is no evidence to suggest that any other company is involved, let alone that this is an industry-wide issue. 

""Consumers should be reassured that cars sold in the UK must comply with strict European laws. 

""All cars must complete a standard emissions test, which, unlike in the US, is…. VW's dirty diesel scandal only gets worse. Volkswagen's ""dirty diesel"" scandal just keeps getting worse. The German automaker now says as many as 11 million cars worldwide could have the software that allegedly fools emissions inspection technology.  

In the U.S., where federal regulators uncovered the scandal, it's hard to find a parking place anywhere near a courthouse, as class action attorneys rush to slap suits on VW, seeking damages for consumers whose cars have overnight gone from high-tech, clean-air wonders to rolling centers of pestilence, emitting 40 times the allowable amount of nitrogen oxide. 

VW's stock has plunged, closing down 19% Monday, wiping out $17 billion of market capitalization. And the company's stock with its relatively small band of loyal consumers -- and auto enthusiasts -- has dropped even lower. 

Straining mightily, VW had just passed Toyota to become the No. 1 automaker worldwide in terms of sales. In the U.S., though, sales have been weak and the company's leadership in the diesel segment had been one of its few bright spots. 

The company faces up to $18 billion in fines in the U.S. alone, but that doesn't even begin to count the cost of recalling and fixing the cars and the huge legal bill that accompanies any blunder of this magnitude. 

Volkswagen's standing with people who write about cars is now at the lowest possible level. For years, journalists -- including this one -- have swallowed VW's claims that its diesels were an engineering marvel that produced excellent acceleration, outstanding fuel economy, and virtually zero emissions from the tailpipe.  

It will be a very long time before anyone takes VW at its word again. 
Courthouse steps 
At least seven class actions have already been filed in California, Illinois, Alabama, and Florida, Courthouse News reported , alleging fraud by concealment, breach of contract, product liability, breach of warranty, and other claims under state and federal laws. 

“The half-a-million people who own these cars are furious, and with good reason,” said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman , a Seattle law firm that was lead counsel in the $1.6 billion Toyota unintended acceleration case. “Not only did they pay more for something they never received, but they’ve been victim to a tremendous act of deception."" 

Even worse, VW ""chose to target the group of consumers who care most about being environmentally conscious,” said Berman, whose lawsuit includes plaintiffs from 23 states. 

Congress may also be getting into the act. 

""The American people deserve answers and assurances that this will not happen again. We intend to get those answers,"" said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He said a hearing will be held soon. 

In Germany, where the car industry accounts for at least 20% of all jobs, politicians swooned as they contemplated the damage to all German marques. Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's senior environmental official, called it a ""case of blatant consumer deception and environmental damage."" 

""I expect VW to reveal, without any gaps, how and to what extent these manipulations have taken place,"" he said, according to Reuters. 

On the other hand, Germany is not alone. Japan's Toyota and the United States' own General Motors have both faced disgrace and huge fines in recent years. Toyota paid a $1.2 billion fine in 2014 for mishandling the unintended acceleration issue and General Motors has agreed to pay $900 million for dragging its feet in the ignition switch case. 

FCA US LLC -- known to most of us as Fiat Chrysler -- has also been dragged through the mud for its sluggish response to Jeep fires. 

Only Korea's auto industry remains unsullied by massive miscalculation and deception -- last time we checked, anyway.. Kurt Busch Crew Chief Tony Gibson is Top MOOG® 'Problem Solver' in Chase Opener at Chicagoland Speedway. Southfield, Michigan, September 22, 2015.Tony Gibson, crew chief for Kurt Busch and the No. 41 Haas Automation Chevrolet SS, won the MOOG ® Steering and Suspension brand's ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award after Busch finished third in Sunday's myAFibRisk400.com 400 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup event at Chicagoland Speedway, Joliet, Ill. Gibson's win, coming in the opening round of the 10-race Chase for the Sprint Cup, moves him into a six-way tie for third place in the MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" standings. MOOG is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by global vehicle components manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver Award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped 41 car improved by a race-high 0.529-seconds per lap on the mile-and-a-half oval. 
    
Busch, who started ninth, ran in the lead pack for most of the afternoon. He had advanced to fifth within the first 60 laps before being forced onto pit road after losing air in a tire and making contact with the wall. He quickly regained the lost ground and was running second after passing his brother, Kyle Busch (No. 18 Toyota), on Lap 147. The 41 car briefly led on Lap 222 before a scheduled pit stop, then regained the lead on Lap 245.  Busch ultimately lost out to the MOOG-equipped No. 11 and 19 Toyotas of Denny Hamlin and Carl Edwards, respectively, in the final five-lap green flag run, with Hamlin picking up his second win of the year. 
 
""Kurt and Tony were in great position on the final restart but it looked like Denny had a little more left on his tires and he made a gutsy move to grab the lead,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""The key to success in the Chase is to improve your position every week, so even though they didn't get the win, I'm sure the 41 team is happy with their performance."" 
 
With nine races remaining, the $100,000 MOOG Problem Solver of the Year Award remains within range for as many as eight crew chiefs. Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Six crew chiefs - including Gibson - are just two wins back. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

HUG#1953829. Toyota's Hydrogen-Powered Mirai Fuel Cell Vehicle Drives the Future of Mobility at the 2015 Excellence in Journalism Conference. -- Toyota will showcase the Mirai at the nation's premier gathering of influential Hispanic journalists -- 

-- The Toyota Mirai is a zero emission fuel cell vehicle capable of powering a home for up to a week -- 

NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After a development process spanning more than 20 years, Toyota's long-awaited hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, the Mirai, will be featured at the Excellence in Journalism (EIJ15) Conference at the Orlando World Center Marriott, September 18-20, in Orlando, FL. Top news professionals from broadcast, print and digital will have the opportunity to experience the Mirai first hand. The conference is being convened jointly by the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA), and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ).

The Mirai will be the conference's only automotive interactive display hosted at the Orlando Marriott World Center's impressive central Atrium. Conference attendees and resort guests will have the opportunity to receive a personalized walk-through from a Mirai product specialist and learn about the unique powertrain and other components that make this vehicle a truly innovative automotive breakthrough. The Mirai can be fueled with hydrogen in around 5 minutes and boasts an EPA estimated range of 312 miles per fill. It has an estimated fuel economy of 67 miles per gallon equivalency and the only emission is water vapor. The Toyota Mirai is also capable of powering a small home for up to a week during an emergency.

Toyota also will sponsor the Hall of Fame Luncheon, where NAHJ will honor Telemundo journalist and MSNBC host José Díaz-Balart with the NAHJ Presidential Award of Visibility for his commitment to journalism, the pursuit of the truth and his accurate and fair representation of Latinos in news coverage.

""As a long-time supporter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, it gives us great pleasure to share with this wonderful group the latest in automotive innovation as we help facilitate discourse on how Latinos are adding their much-needed voices to the journalism landscape in this country,"" stated Patricia Salas Pineda, group vice president of Toyota's Hispanic Business Strategy Group. ""As the top-selling automotive brand in the Hispanic market for more than 10 years, we have a close relationship with the Hispanic community and NAHJ, and are pleased to be part of the conversation regarding diversity of ideas, voices and points of view in news reporting.""

Mekahlo Medina, NAHJ national president, commented, ""We are pleased to have Toyota as a long-time partner to carry forward our mission of advancing and recognizing the achievements of Hispanics in the news industry."" About Toyota 

Toyota (NYSE:TM), the world's top automaker and creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to building vehicles for the way people live through our Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands. Over the past 50 years, we've built more than 25 million cars and trucks in North America, where we operate 14 manufacturing plants (10 in the U.S.) and directly employ more than 42,000 people (more than 33,000 in the U.S.). Our 1,800 North American dealerships (1,500 in the U.S.) sold more than 2.67 million cars and trucks (more than 2.35 million in the U.S.) in 2014 – and about 80 percent of all Toyota vehicles sold over the past 20 years are still on the road today.. Race Strategy Pays Off for Greg Biffle Crew Chief Matt Puccia with Top-5 Finish and MOOG® 'Problem Solver' Honors at Loudon. .Matt Puccia, crew chief for the No. 16
Kleen Performance Products Ford Fusion, rolled the dice by keeping his driver,
Greg Biffle, on the track while other teams were opting for fuel and new tires
in the final 85 laps of Sunday''s Sylvania 300 NASCAR(®) Sprint Cup race at New
Hampshire Motor Speedway, Loudon, N.H. The gamble paid off as the 16 car had
just enough fuel to coast over the finish line in fourth place. Following the
race, Puccia received the prestigious ""Problem Solver of the Race"" crew chief
award from MOOG(®), the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR.

Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul
Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: FDML), the
weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers
the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the
lead lap. The Roush-Fenway Racing-owned 16 car, which started 25(th), improved
by a race-high 0.389-seconds per lap in earning its third top-five finish of
2015. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota
Camry.

Biffle was running 15(th) with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish
without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle
to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps
to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the
final green-flag segments to finish in the top five.

""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn''t
have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson, director of
motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""Matt absolutely nailed their chassis
setup for the final 100 laps. Greg was running on old rubber but was still able
to fight off challenges from several drivers.""

Puccia''s weekly Problem Solver win - his first - leaves the top of the standings
unchanged in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year""
Award. With eight races remaining, Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief
Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin
Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Seven crew chiefs have two
wins apiece.

The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR
crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension
components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup
teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends.
Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

Sponsored by global vehicle components manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver Award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped 41 car improved by a race-high 0.529-seconds per lap on the mile-and-a-half oval. 
    
Busch, who started ninth, ran in the lead pack for most of the afternoon. He had advanced to fifth within the first 60 laps before being forced onto pit road after losing air in a tire and making contact with the wall. He quickly regained the lost ground and was running second after passing his brother, Kyle Busch (No. 18 Toyota), on Lap 147. The 41 car briefly led on Lap 222 before a scheduled pit stop, then regained the lead on Lap 245.  Busch ultimately lost out to the MOOG-equipped No. 11 and 19 Toyotas of Denny Hamlin and Carl Edwards, respectively, in the final five-lap green flag run, with Hamlin picking up his second win of the year. 
 
""Kurt and Tony were in great position on the final restart but it looked like Denny had a little more left on his tires and he made a gutsy move to grab the lead,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""The key to success in the Chase is to improve your position every week, so even though they didn't get the win, I'm sure the 41 team is happy with their performance."" 
 
With nine races remaining, the $100,000 MOOG Problem Solver of the Year Award remains within range for as many as eight crew chiefs. Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Six crew chiefs - including Gibson - are just two wins back. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

HUG#1953829. Race Strategy Pays Off for Greg Biffle Crew Chief Matt Puccia with Top-5 Finish and MOOG® 'Problem Solver' Honors at Loudon. Southfield, Michigan, September 29, 2015.Matt Puccia, crew chief for the No. 16 Kleen Performance Products Ford Fusion, rolled the dice by keeping his driver, Greg Biffle, on the track while other teams were opting for fuel and new tires in the final 85 laps of Sunday's Sylvania 300 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Loudon, N.H. The gamble paid off as the 16 car had just enough fuel to coast over the finish line in fourth place. Following the race, Puccia received the prestigious ""Problem Solver of the Race"" crew chief award from MOOG ® , the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Roush-Fenway Racing-owned 16 car, which started 25 th , improved by a race-high 0.389-seconds per lap in earning its third top-five finish of 2015. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
    
Biffle was running 15 th with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the final green-flag segments to finish in the top five. 
 
""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn't have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""Matt absolutely nailed their chassis setup for the final 100 laps. Greg was running on old rubber but was still able to fight off challenges from several drivers."" 
 
Puccia's weekly Problem Solver win - his first - leaves the top of the standings unchanged in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. With eight races remaining, Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three.

HUG#1955450. Carl Edwards Wins at Darlington, Crew Chief Darian Grubb Earns Second MOOG® 'Problem Solver of the Race' Award. Southfield, Michigan, September 9, 2015.Carl Edwards, driver of the No. 19 Arris Toyota Camry, overcame an early two-lap deficit to claim his second NASCAR ® Sprint Cup victory of the year and his crew chief, Darian Grubb, earned his second MOOG ® Steering and Suspension ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award in Sunday night's Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. MOOG, in its 50 th year of Cup competition, is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
    
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped No. 19 Toyota - featuring a classic 1960s MOOG racing decal on the front fenders - improved by a race-best 0.228-second per lap, helping to advance Edwards into the lead pack near the end of the race. 
 
Grubb's contribution to the win could be seen throughout the race, from the No. 19's methodical 200-lap march toward the front after falling two laps behind, to a dazzling pit stop that gave Edwards a crucial advantage heading into the final eight-lap drag race to the checkered flag. Grubb and the Joe Gibbs Racing crew continually improved the performance of the 19 car's MOOG-equipped chassis and NASCAR's low-downforce configuration, ultimately giving Edwards the fastest and best handling car for the final green-flag run. 
 
""Carl is one of the most vocal advocates of the low-downforce package, and we saw why tonight,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""That configuration puts more pressure on the crew chief to nail the chassis setup and the driver to be as aggressive as possible. Darian gave Carl the best car when it mattered most, and he certainly earned our weekly MOOG Problem Solver award."" 
 
Grubb's latest Problem Solver win elevates him into a six-way tie for second place in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. Leading in the standings with three weekly wins apiece are crew chiefs Greg Ives (No. 88 Chevrolet, Dale Earnhardt Jr.) and Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award through the first 25 Cup races.

susan.fisher@federalmogul.com. Not just Volkswagen: A list of past auto industry scandals. With Volkswagen's admission that 11 million of its diesel vehicles worldwide contain software that can rig emissions tests, the German automaker joins a list of auto industry scandals that spans several decades. Among them, Ford Pintos that burst into flames, Toyota vehicles that take off unintentionally and air bags that explode, showering a car's interior with shrapnel. 

FORD PINTO 

At least 27 people died during the 1970s due to the faulty position of fuel tanks in the Ford Pinto. In some cases, the fuel tank burst into flames following a rear-end collision.  Ford recalled more than 1.5 million Pintos in 1978. 

FIRESTONE TIRES 

About 6.5 million Firestone tires were recalled in 2000 because the tires could shred, blow out or fail. Most of the tires were used in Ford SUVs and light pickup trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in 2001 that it received 271 reports of deaths and 800 injuries related to the faulty tires. 

TOYOTA 

Toyota agreed to pay $1.2 billion in a settlement last year, admitting that it hid information about defects that caused Toyota and Lexus vehicles to accelerate unexpectedly. Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles, starting in 2009, for several issues, including faulty brakes, sticky gas pedals and problematic floor mats. 

GENERAL MOTORS 

The automaker's faulty ignition switches have been linked to at least 169 deaths. The switch could slip out of the run position and turn the engine off while driving. Last week, GM agreed to pay $900 million to settle a criminal investigation over the ignition issue. GM has admitted that some employees knew about the problem for nearly a decade, yet cars equipped with the switch were not recalled until last year. 

TAKATA AIR BAGS 

According to the latest figures from federal regulators, approximately 23.4 million driver and passenger Takata air bags made by on 19.2 million vehicles are being recalled and need to be replaced. The air bags can inflate too quickly and explode, sending metal shrapnel into drivers and passengers. The air bags, which were used in several vehicles, are blamed for causing seven deaths in the U.S. 

SOURCE: AP Archives. Crisis stocks – should you catch a crashing car?. Should you buy Volkswagen shares since the German automaking giant got itself embroiled in the emissions scandal? 

					 
Many investors did just that in the middle of last week after the stock had lost some 30 percent amid fears of a hefty fine of up to $18 billion from the U.S. Environmental Protections Agency (EPA) and the additional fallout from civil and class actions suits in the US. 


					 
But by Wednesday, it dawned on some investors that the selloff – exacerbated by short-sellers – had been overdone and that the stock might provide a bargain. The company also moved quickly to apologize, assign blame and replace chief executive Martin Winterkorn. 

					  
												
																		
	 
						
																										
						
						
															
																				    A trader at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, Monday June 29,  2015.  
	
															
						
				  
Deutsche Bank analysts are still cautious though: "" We think the impact on the operational business – namely volumes, residual values, pricing and costs - is even harder to estimate and is the key concern here,"" it wrote in a note on Tuesday. 

					 
""A main element of our buy case had been significant cost cuts. We now believe that rising costs for diesel cars will offset most of the effects. Most importantly, we have taken a more cautious stance on the growth outlook for VW and Audi and believe pricing will come under pressure due to the reputational damage. Consequently, we cut our 2015-2017 earnings by up to 35 percent."" 

					 
Deutsche Bank adds that ""any 1 billion euro additional fine would take away 2.02 euros per share"" – it has downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold. 

					 
Saxo Bank's Head of Equity Strategy Peter Garnry agrees: ""We don't think the current provisions are big enough. VW has set aside 6.5 billion euro to cover the costs, but that market has already taken out 25 billion euros,"" he said in an in house interview on  Wednesday 

					 
""Clearly, the market thinks the fine will be bigger than the ($)18 billion the EPA has talked about.  This is a huge scandal and it looks like this was not an isolated case in the US, but is more widespread across the world. (…) Nobody knows how far the scandal can go"" 

					  
												
																		
	 
						
																																																																		
						
						
															
																																											
																																											
																																		
							
			
									
						
				  
That begs the wider question: Are investors catching a falling knife or is buying heavily beaten-down crisis stocks a viable strategy? 

					 
Take BP – which swiftly became an enfant terrible after the disastrous Gulf of Mexico spill. If you bought BP's stock after disaster and held it until today, you would have lost half of your money. Buying on the dip did not turn out to be a profitable strategy as the losses and legal problems stemming from the environmental disaster rose relentlessly. Other issues like the precipitous drop in the oil price also contributes to BP's stock woes. 

					 
Look at Toyota though, which was marred by recalls in 2010, the story looks somewhat different. 

					 
Between February 2010, to March 2014, Toyota stock has gained 45 percent. Yes, it too did drop after the recalls. Toyota's stock price had slumped by 20 percent—a $35 billion loss of market value in February of 2010.  But the longer term performance shows it has regained speed. 

					 
Bottom line – generalizing the investment strategy around three crisis stocks is close to impossible. 

					 
But think about this: Apart from the fundamental question of how risk averse you are,  the other key issue is also just how long your time horizon for investing is. Buying on the dips may prove a profitable strategy if you're spot-on with timing. However, very few of us are. 

					 
In the absence of the light at the end of the tunnel, the more prudent strategy may be to steer clear of crisis stocks. After all, a stock that looks cheap may be a bargain for a reason.

NOVI, Mich. , Sept. 4, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Hino Trucks participated in last week's celebration of the 2,000th Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher (HVIP) hosted by the California Air Resources Board. Elected officials, and other industry members, including CALSTART, which administers the program for ARB, were in attendance as the recipient, Redwood Products of Chino, CA took ownership of a Hino COE model 195h delivery truck. 
 
HVIP is the nation's first program to directly reduce the up-front cost of hybrid or zero-emission trucks and buses. HVIP incentives drive manufacturing production and fleet acceptance of the advanced heavy-duty vehicle technologies California must deploy to meet its long-term air quality and climate goals. Redwood Products is the recipient of a $23,000 voucher, which covered close to one-third of the price of a low-carbon Hino hybrid truck. 
 
Since 2010, ARB has awarded 2,000 vouchers for low-carbon hybrid and zero-emission trucks. ""At Hino, we are committed to doing our part in reducing our carbon footprint and our 195h model is proof in motion of this commitment. Since 1991, we have sold over 15,000 vehicles worldwide using Hino's hybrid technology, making us an industry leader in commercial hybrid product sales,"" said Glenn Ellis , Vice President of Marketing, Product Planning and Dealer Operations for Hino Trucks . 
 
""Like other forward-looking companies, Hino Trucks has demonstrated that California's efforts to support cleaner low-carbon trucks and transportation creates a market and a successful business opportunity,"" ARB Executive Officer Richard Corey said. 
 
This incentive program has contributed to air pollution reductions in neighborhoods throughout California . Since its launch in 2010, HVIP has provided more than $63 million to help California fleets statewide purchase more than 430 zero-emission trucks and buses and 1,800 hybrid trucks and buses – and additional funding is on the way. 
 
Ellis continued, ""We applaud CARB in their mission to improve California's air quality with the HVIP program, and are excited for our customers to take advantage of this outstanding opportunity to lessen our dependence on oil and create a cleaner California while keeping more of their hard earned money. It is our goal to help support CARB's initiative of accelerating the deployment of hybrid trucks. With our proven track record, we are confident that our customers can capture significant fuel savings, while reducing their carbon footprint in operating our 195h."" 
 
""HVIP has been a highly successful partnership between the State, commercial fleets, CALSTART and industry to help speed clean truck and bus deployment,"" said John Boesel , President and CEO at CALSTART, the national clean transportation non-profit which manages the incentive project for ARB. ""It's for all fleets and all communities to place the most efficient and cleanest vehicles on the road, to help tackle air quality and climate problems and save themselves money.""

Over the past few years, we have had quite a fair share of test hydrogen fuel buses at various locations around the world. Already back in 2009, keen developers of the technology introduced it in north-east China, closely followed by Mercedes-Benz Citaro FuelCELL hybrid bus that hit the streets of Hamburg later on the same year. Not long after, in 2010, Singapore and then London saw their first eight hydrogen fuel cell buses.
The new kid on the block is a product of the collaboration between the Japanese automaker Toyota and Hino Motors. The bus is powered by the same hydrogen fuel cell system that Toyota has put in their Toyota Mirai car. The system has two stacks of fuel cells and eight hydrogen tanks with storage capacity of 480 l (106 gal). Each of the two units can produce a maximum output of 114kW.
The buses are currently under testing in the Japanese capital Tokyo thanks to the cooperation of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. From 24th until 30th of July, the vehicles will be covering public roads in the city center and the waterfront areas. The automakers from Toyota are hoping to gather enough information on performance of the vehicles, so that they can further improve the technology and make it perfect and fully ready for market launch.
The guys behind the technology would also like to assess the practicality of fuel cell buses for integration within the public transport system. In addition, they are hoping to assess whether the external power supply system can deliver in case of emergency and power outages.
Toyota and Hino hope that these new zero-emission fuel cell buses will bring us a step closer to an eco-friendly hydrogen-based society.

Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Roush-Fenway Racing-owned 16 car, which started 25 th , improved by a race-high 0.389-seconds per lap in earning its third top-five finish of 2015. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
    
Biffle was running 15 th with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the final green-flag segments to finish in the top five. 
 
""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn't have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""Matt absolutely nailed their chassis setup for the final 100 laps. Greg was running on old rubber but was still able to fight off challenges from several drivers."" 
 
Puccia's weekly Problem Solver win - his first - leaves the top of the standings unchanged in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. With eight races remaining, Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Seven crew chiefs have two wins apiece.

HUG#1953829. Public and Private Sectors Work Together to Test Renewable CO2-free Hydrogen Supply Chain. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, nearly 25 gigatons of CO2-over half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions-come from the use of fossil fuels in electricity and heat generation, industry, and transportation*. Realizing the importance of taking on this challenge by establishing carbon-neutral supply chains across different sectors (from power generation to vehicle fueling) as soon as possible, major corporate and public sector partners in Japan have decided to work together. 
 
Announced today, the new initiative aims to trial a full-fledged carbon-neutral hydrogen supply chain powered by renewable wind energy. The trials will take place near the cities of Yokohama and Kawasaki in the Keihin coastal region. 
 
Hydrogen has the potential to permanently change the way we generate and use power. It can be created using renewable energy sources, stored, transported, and used at a later point-all with minimal environmental burden. 
 
While hydrogen is most commonly created through a reaction between methane and steam, it can also be created from water through electrolysis. More often than not, this requires electricity-which is still typically produced using fossil-fuel-burning power plants. Since the overall environmental benefit of hydrogen is only as strong as the method used to produce it, global research initiatives around the world are dedicated to developing large-scale carbon-neutral projects that use renewable energy to power hydrogen production. 
 
Under this trial project, wind power will be used to turn water into oxygen and hydrogen, with the latter stored for use locally. Grid power will only be used for backup when absolutely necessary and excess renewable energy produced may even be sold to utility companies. 
 
As plans currently stand, the project will involve 
 
- A system to produce hydrogen by electrolyzing water using wind power 
 
- A system to optimize storage and transportation of hydrogen produced 
 
- Use of fuel cell forklifts 
 
- A hydrogen supply chain feasibility study (hydrogen price, CO2 reduction, etc.) 
 
On the public sector side, the project is being implemented by the Kanagawa Prefectural Government, Yokohama City, and Kawasaki City. The four private sector participants are Iwatani Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Toyota Turbine and Systems Inc. In addition, the project will be supported by Japan's
			Ministry of the Environment. 
 
.. Carl Edwards Wins at Darlington, Crew Chief Darian Grubb Earns Second MOOG® 'Problem Solver of the Race' Award. Southfield, Michigan, September 9, 2015.Carl Edwards, driver of the No. 19 Arris Toyota Camry, overcame an early two-lap deficit to claim his second NASCAR ® Sprint Cup victory of the year and his crew chief, Darian Grubb, earned his second MOOG ® Steering and Suspension ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award in Sunday night's Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. MOOG, in its 50 th year of Cup competition, is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped No. 19 Toyota - featuring a classic 1960s MOOG racing decal on the front fenders - improved by a race-best 0.228-second per lap, helping to advance Edwards into the lead pack near the end of the race. 
 
Grubb's contribution to the win could be seen throughout the race, from the No. 19's methodical 200-lap march toward the front after falling two laps behind, to a dazzling pit stop that gave Edwards a crucial advantage heading into the final eight-lap drag race to the checkered flag. Grubb and the Joe Gibbs Racing crew continually improved the performance of the 19 car's MOOG-equipped chassis and NASCAR's low-downforce configuration, ultimately giving Edwards the fastest and best handling car for the final green-flag run. 
 
""Carl is one of the most vocal advocates of the low-downforce package, and we saw why tonight,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""That configuration puts more pressure on the crew chief to nail the chassis setup and the driver to be as aggressive as possible. Darian gave Carl the best car when it mattered most, and he certainly earned our weekly MOOG Problem Solver award."" 
 
Grubb's latest Problem Solver win elevates him into a six-way tie for second place in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. Leading in the standings with three weekly wins apiece are crew chiefs Greg Ives (No. 88 Chevrolet, Dale Earnhardt Jr.) and Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award through the first 25 Cup races.

Boasting a 5-door cabin, this new design study is more closely representative of the compact crossover which is now confirmed for production. Its more refined execution is designed to gage reactions from specific target customer groups, in order that their feedback may further inform the project designers and engineers. This highly-innovative design study for a stylish, lightweight and dynamic hybrid crossover is designed to stand out in an increasingly homogenous market place. It is the next rendition of Akio Toyoda’s promise, on taking over the presidency of Toyota, to build always better cars that bring the fun back to driving. Its compact proportions placing it between the B-SUV and C-SUV segments, the TOYOTA C-HR Concept offers the combination of outstanding agility and flexible packaging, both essential to those with urban lifestyles. It has been designed around a new platform, developed under the TNGA (Toyota New Global Architecture) programme, to satisfy customers’ demands for state of the art handling and controllability. In conjunction, a new, advanced, full-hybrid powertrain offers a uniquely engaging driving experience matched to 21st century traffic conditions, whilst delivering outstanding efficiency. A Refined Diamond Styling Theme The new, 5-door C-HR Concept continues Toyota’s exploration of an expressive new, diamond architecture styling theme. Below a compact, sensual cabin profile, the lower bodywork has been sculpted to represent the facetted surfaces of a highly-durable, precision-cut gemstone. In plan form, the corners of the bodyshell have been cleanly shaved off. This both removes mass from the overall volume, and highlights the powerful flair of the front and rear wheel arches, reinforcing the crossover’s broad, planted stance from every viewpoint, and matching the target customer’s desire for a vehicle with a confident and sporty look. The front of the C-HR Concept represents a further development of Toyota’s Keen Look design identity. Above a robust central bumper profile, the slim upper grille has been evolved into a floating ‘wing’ graphic which flows seamlessly around the front corners of the vehicle. At the wing extremities, streamlined headlamp clusters combine advanced lighting technology with diamond-pattern detailing. Adding impact to the vehicle corners to further reinforce the new crossover’s solid stance and the low centre of gravity inhe-rent in its new TNGA platform, the large, diamond-patterned lower grille is flanked by strongly sculpted downward projections. These powerful frontal elements are underscored by an aero-inspired, floating front spoiler. From the side, the highly-facetted lower body, muscular wheel arches and aggressively angular rear shoulder are juxtaposed with an exceptionally sleek cabin profile. Its ‘floating’ status reinforced by a piano black paint finish, the roof is detailed with patterned openings which create a uniquely animated play of light within the C-HR Concept’s cabin space. Seen from the rear, the glasshouse tapers dramatically down to a powerfully facetted lower body highlighted by a pronounced diffuser, integrated foglamps and highly-distinctive, aero-inspired, floating rear lamp clusters incorporating diamond-pattern lens detailing. The ‘diamond-cut’, machined-surface spokes of a unique, 21” wheel design hint at the sophistication and efficiency of the C-HR Concept’s full-hybrid powertrain. Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) Platform The new C-HR Concept is a striking representation of the benefits of TNGA; an innovative, integrated vehicle development approach for powertrain components and platforms being introduced on new Toyota models from this year forward. TNGA manifests itself in the new C-HR Concept through an increase in body rigidity, better collision performance, improvements to the vehicle underbody and suspension, and a lowering of the centre of gravity. Acting in conjunction, higher body rigidity and a lower centre of gravity reduce body movement and vehicle roll when cornering. This allows for a reduction in suspension stiffness and a resultant increase in ride comfort with no detriment to driving dynamics, equipping the C-HR Concept with the responsive handling, agility and straight-line stability on a par with the best C-segment hatchbacks. Incorporating a set of new production techniques and technologies that will make it easier to turn vehicle designs and features into production reality, TNGA groups vehicle development to promote a strategic sharing of parts and powertrain components. This approach will reduce the resources required for development by 20% or more, freeing up investment for improved product strengths and advanced technology development for sustainable growth. A New, More Efficient Hybrid System C-HR Concept doesn’t only stand out through its unique design. It also introduces hybrid technology to the segment. In this case, a new and more compact full-hybrid powertrain with lighter componentry. It reflects significant advances in battery, electric motor and petrol engine technologies, offering further reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Operating in synergy with a petrol engine boasting world-beating thermal efficiency of over 40%, the C-HR Concept’s next-generation full-hybrid powertrain combines state-of-the-art battery technology with new, highly-compact electric motors offering a marked increase in power density. More compact, lighter in weight and more efficient than Toyota’s current hybrid systems, the new full-hybrid powertrain developed under the TNGA programme will also be notably more refined, and even easier and more intuitive to drive, with a natural, smooth and immediate response to driver inputs. A Global Project Rooted in the European Market The new C-HR Concept is another tangible application of Toyota’s new Global Vision thinking, first advocated by President Akio Toyoda in 2011. Recognizing that Europe is the most demanding market for small and mid-sized vehicles, Toyota uses this region as benchmark for defining future global A-, B- and C-segment cars. Toyota Motor Europe (TME) has also become the company’s skill centre for perceived quality and vehicle dynamics. In the case of the C-HR Concept, there was close cooperation between Toyota’s vehicle planning centres in Japan and in Europe, in order to get a good understanding of the latest European customer demands and vehicle trends. The styling of the concept car is the result of a global cooperation between ED2 (European Design Development Centre) and the other Toyota design centres. Following the overwhelming reaction to the first TOYOTA C-HR Concept shown at the 2014 Paris Motorshow, TME will continue to work hand in hand with TMC (Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan) to enter the C-Crossover segment. (Toyota Press Release). Toyota Mirai makes 65-plate debut in London. The Toyota Mirai made an historic journey past London’s landmarks in a zero-emissions, hydrogen-powered journey to mark its UK market debut and the arrival of the new 65-plate registration. During its near-silent progress through the capital, Mirai produced no exhaust pollution at all, emitting only water vapour. Mirai – the name means ‘future’ in Japanese – is the world’s first fuel cell saloon to enter full production. Although it is powered by Toyota’s advanced fuel cell technology, it is designed to be every bit as practical and convenient to drive as a conventional car. The UK is among Toyota’s first European markets for Mirai, its introduction linked to the development of a national infrastructure for supplying and selling hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen is stored in the car’s high-pressure tanks and used to generate electric power in a Toyota-designed fuel cell system. Rooted in Toyota’s hybrid technology, Mirai’s drive system marks a significant step towards achieving sustainable, zero-emissions mobility as part of a low carbon society. Mirai has an on-the-road price of £66,000, before any Government incentive is taken into account. The great majority of Mirai’s UK customers are expected to lease their vehicle and Toyota will shortly be announcing an attractively priced leasing programme. related stories.

HUG#1953829. 2016 Toyota Mirai Takes the “Hy-Road” to Zero Emissions [Review]. Drive to the grocery store, water your plants. The 2016 Toyota Mirai is the Japanese automaker’s first production hydrogen fuel cell sedan and is close to being launched in California. The Mirai, along with the Hyundai Tucson and Honda FCV, are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) that uses compressed hydrogen and oxygen from the atmosphere in a chemical reaction that creates electricity to power a compact motor, which in turn drives the front wheels. The only emission is water vapor. The Toyota Mirai promises a 312-mile range between hydrogen fill-ups, room for four passengers and a refueling time of three to four minutes (H70\/700 bar). Unlike a plug-in electric vehicle, there’s no waiting hours for the battery to recharge. With a top speed of 111 mph and zero-to-60 mph times of less than 10 seconds, performance is similar to an EV such as the Nissan Leaf and VW e-Golf. A little larger than its hybrid cousins, the Prius and CT 200h, the Mirai is built on a platform that was previously used by the retired Lexus HS 250h. Size matters and everything – including the propulsion system, battery, and two lightweight carbon fiber reinforced plastic, high-pressure hydrogen tanks – had to fit. Many components of the electric-drive system are shared with Toyota’s hybrid drivetrain with the benefit of keeping build costs down. Driving Impressions Promising a punch of 152 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, the engine feels reasonably strong and also has a ‘power mode’ that releases more hydrogen into the fuel cell stack. Even though it shares electric powertrain bits from the Prius, the Mirai is much different than its hybrid cousin. Cabin materials are nicer than a Prius and it has many premium features that you won’t find in a Prius. Plus, this is a heavier car that weighs 1,006 pounds more than a regular Prius, and you feel the extra weight pushing the car into corners. Realistically, the Mirai has plenty of pep for a car where performance is not supposed to be a selling point. Mashing the throttle to the floor from a dead- or rolling-stop invigorates the Mirai with instantaneous torque response from the electric motor. Trying to coax more acceleration for passing at highway speeds is a slow and steady process – a behavior that is typical with hybrids and EVs. Toyota thinks most buyers of the Mirai will be more appreciative of the smooth, comfortable ride over a sporty edge. I drove the 2016 Mirai for a day and into the night, and logged 262 miles. At the end of my test drive the Mirai reported a miles per gallon equivalency (MPGe) of 60 compared to the factory spec of 67 MPGe. This was my second time behind the wheel of the Mirai – the first experience was limited to a 5 minute test drive around the block and a distance less than two miles. This time I had the full experience and drove it from the San Francisco Bay Area, to Sacramento, then to the East Bay for more driving time at night. I was expecting the Mirai to drive similar to an EV, but had a total change in attitude by the time I was ready to return the key to Toyota. There are lots of good things to say about this zero-emission car, and very few that aren’t so good. One of the first things that I appreciated was the hush tone of the cabin and its ability to insulate the passengers from road noise. The combination of acoustic glass, sound absorbing materials, and sound-insulating materials placed inside the body frame work together reducing noise and vibrations; the carpets are fitted without any gaps and there are lots of soft-touch surfaces that absorb sound. Everything comes together resulting in a quiet, refined trip that is on par with a Lexus ES or GS. The steering response has a light feel and somewhat numb, but overall it is good for being electric power assisted. Handling and ride quality is even better. There is minimal body lean carving through the corners and the ride quality, which feels on the firm side, is not bumpy or harsh feeling. The 4,078 pound curb weight probably contributes to the smooth, plush ride. The seats are injection-molded and covered in a psuedo-leather material called Softex, while comfortable and conforming, the material isn’t nice to touch. I have a small body frame and did not notice myself squirming in the seat to find a comfortable spot, nor was I sliding around when testing the cornering capabilities. The front and rear seats are heated, but neither setup with fans underneath for cooling. The cabin design has a sculpted dashboard and an information display mounted high and centered. Scrolling through the multitude of display screens report information on energy usage, MPGe diary, how good (or poorly) your driving style has affected fuel consumption, and more. Navigation, infotainment and climate controls are accessible on another panel below the central display screens. The electrostatic touchscreen switches are modern and attractive, but gets messy with fingerprints and smudges easily. The Mirai is well equipped with LED headlamps, heated steering wheel, individual automatic climate control for the front passengers, and adaptive cruise control. Back seat passengers have heated seats and plenty of legroom. Because the rear seats sit above the hydrogen tanks, headroom is limited. Mirai also has a broad range of standard onboard safety technologies, including vehicle pre-collision, blind spot monitor, lane departure alert, drive start control and automatic high beams. Beginning Fall 2015, the Mirai is only going to be available to California customers whose application is accepted by Toyota. Initially, eight dealerships in California have been selected to sell 700 units of the hydrogen fuel-cell car, but the program will expand up to 2,000 units next year and eventually become available in the Northeast states of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Early Adopters Beware The cost to own a 2016 Toyota Mirai outright is $58,325, or lease it for $499 a month for 36 months with $3,649 due at signing. If you choose to purchase a Mirai, there are federal and state incentives available, which can reduce the price by as much as $13,000. The purchase price includes three years or $15,000 worth of free hydrogen fuel for the car; a week’s worth of rental-car access for the first three year; a hydrogen fuel station finder app; 24\/7 customer support; and an eight-year, 100,000-mile hydrogen powertrain warranty. Zero emissions vehicles are allowed access to California’s high occupancy (HOV) lanes, which is a good perk if you’re commuting alone. Locating a refueling station will be a challenge for early adopters, much like trying to find an EV charging station a few years ago. California has plans to open 56 hydrogen refueling stations in select areas up through autumn 2016, of which eight are officially open now. Check the California Fuel Cell Partnership (www.cafcp.org) website for maps and current information about the planned hydrogen fueling stations and the program’s progress. The website is also a good source of information about the collaboration that is happening with involved government agencies, automakers, and energy providers. Using the TFL Car scale of Buy it! Lease it! Rent it! … or forget it! The Mirai gets earns a “Lease it!” for its advanced engineering, near-luxury ride and comfort, and better than average ride quality. It loses points for its expensive entry price, lack of feedback through the steering wheel, and the touch quality of the seat material and panel switches. Plus, it’s probably a good idea to be tied to evolving automotive technologies short-term. While the Mirai leads us down the path of alternative fuel and zero emissions, at the end of the day it is simply a car that does its job well – and has the added benefit of providing water for your plants. 2016 Toyota Mirai Specs: Type: Polymer electrolyte fuel cell Max. output (bhp\/kW): 153\/114 Motor: AC synchronous electric generator Max. output (bhp)\/kW): 151\/113 Max. torque (lb-ft\/Nm): 247\/335 Transmission: single-speed step-down Fuel: compressed hydrogen Max. filling pressure (Mpa): 87.5 Nominal working pressure (Mpa): 70 Storage density (wt%): 5.7 Hydrogen storage mass (kg): approximately 5.0 Refueling time: approximately 3 minutes Battery: Nickel-metal hydride Max. output voltage (V): 650 Cruising range (miles): 312 Miles per gallon equivalency (MPGe): 67 Max. speed (mph): 111 Acceleration 0-62 mph (sec): 9.6 Acceleration 25-44 mph (sec): 3.0 Length x Width x Height (inches): 192.5 x 71.5 x 60.4 Wheelbase (inches): 109.4 Ground clearance (inches): 5.1 Curb weight (lbs\/kg): 4078\/1850 Coefficient of drag (Cd): 0.29 2010 Toyota, fuel cell, hydrogen, hydrogen fuel-cell, mirai, Review, Toyota Mirai. Australia: 2016 Toyota LandCruiser Prado to sport revised powertrains. Toyota Australia has updated the popular LandCruiser Prado for MY2016 with the addition of a revised powertrain line-up along with minor updates. The company has added an all-new turbo-diesel engine and revised the petrol V6 engine, while adding a new 6-speed automatic transmission to the line-up. 
 
The all-new 1GD-FTV 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine will replace the 3.0-litre engine previously offered. The new engine has been downsized by 227 cm3 yet it produces enhanced output of 450Nm while reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The engine offers fuel efficiency of 12.5 km\/l with the automatic transmission and 12.65 km\/l with the manual transmission in combined cycle. 
 
The 4.0-litre V6 petrol engine has also been updated and now produces an additional 5kW (6.7 hp) peaking at 207kW (277 hp) of power while lowering CO2 emissions by up to 1.8% from the earlier version. The engine features new injectors, revised ECU mapping and an improved exhaust system for enhanced fuel flow and atomisation. 
 
A new 6-speed automatic transmission will be offered on both the engines with new technology that monitors acceleration and conditions to select the gears. It also features the inclusion of artificial inelegance shift control to optimise responses to acceleration and engine braking. A 6-speed manual transmission will also be offered. 
 

 
The 2016 Prado also gets the addition of satellite navigation on the GXL trim levels. The system features the ‘navigate to destination’ menu with the Toyota Link4 connected mobility system. The infotainment system in the GXL also adds more 3-speakers, taking up the total number of speakers to 9. 
 
The addition of satellite navigation to the popular grade brings the convenience of this technology to the vast majority of Prado buyers. GXL – including the special-edition “Altitude” diesel based on this grade – accounts for more than three-quarters of all Prado sales. VX and Kakadu are already equipped with this feature. 
 
The range-topping Kakadu trim level also adds Rear Cross-Traffic Alert system, which warns the driver of approaching vehicles while reversing. The 2016 Prado features an increase in prices from 0.5% to 2.6% and is priced from AU$52,990..

The press release has been embedded below for further information. Carl Edwards Wins at Darlington, Crew Chief Darian Grubb Earns Second MOOG® 'Problem Solver of the Race' Award. Southfield, Michigan, September 9, 2015.Carl Edwards, driver of the No. 19 Arris Toyota Camry, overcame an early two-lap deficit to claim his second NASCAR ® Sprint Cup victory of the year and his crew chief, Darian Grubb, earned his second MOOG ® Steering and Suspension ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award in Sunday night's Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. MOOG, in its 50 th year of Cup competition, is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
    
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped No. 19 Toyota - featuring a classic 1960s MOOG racing decal on the front fenders - improved by a race-best 0.228-second per lap, helping to advance Edwards into the lead pack near the end of the race. 
 
Grubb's contribution to the win could be seen throughout the race, from the No. 19's methodical 200-lap march toward the front after falling two laps behind, to a dazzling pit stop that gave Edwards a crucial advantage heading into the final eight-lap drag race to the checkered flag. Grubb and the Joe Gibbs Racing crew continually improved the performance of the 19 car's MOOG-equipped chassis and NASCAR's low-downforce configuration, ultimately giving Edwards the fastest and best handling car for the final green-flag run. 
 
""Carl is one of the most vocal advocates of the low-downforce package, and we saw why tonight,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""That configuration puts more pressure on the crew chief to nail the chassis setup and the driver to be as aggressive as possible. Darian gave Carl the best car when it mattered most, and he certainly earned our weekly MOOG Problem Solver award."" 
 
Grubb's latest Problem Solver win elevates him into a six-way tie for second place in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. Leading in the standings with three weekly wins apiece are crew chiefs Greg Ives (No. 88 Chevrolet, Dale Earnhardt Jr.) and Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award through the first 25 Cup races. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

VW Will Recall and Fix All 11 Million Cars in Diesel Scandal. ​Matthias Mueller, the new CEO of beleaguered Volkswagen, announced Tuesday morning that the automaker will refit all the vehicles caught cheating on diesel emissions tests. That means recalling 11 million cars, Reuters reports, at an estimated cost of more than $6.5 billion. 

It's a staggering number. For comparison, VW sold barely more than 10 million cars in all of 2014. The 11 million cars outpaces even the colossal Toyota recall over unintended acceleration, which added up to about 10 million vehicles. The list of cars to be recalled includes 5 million VWs, 2 million Audis, plus several million more Skodas and light commercial vehicles. 
- Continue Reading Below 

Today's announcement was no doubt spurred by the impending deadline of October 7 that the German Federal Motor Transport Authority gave Volkswagen to fix these cars or see them banned from German roads . This will be a ""comprehensive recall and refit plan,"" Mueller said, but we're still awaiting the specifics of just exactly what VW plans to do.

 From:   Popular Mechanics. Why GM Paid So Much Less Than Toyota For Their Safety Scandal. Good Morning! Welcome to The Morning Shift , your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Here are the important stories you need to know. 
 
1st: A Case Of Cooperation 
 
Last night it came out that General Motors will have to pay $900 million to settle the criminal case over the ignition switch defect blamed for 124 deaths and countless injuries. That’s less that the $1.2 billion Toyota had to pay to end the unintended acceleration case. Why? From The Detroit News : 
  
   
Peter J. Henning, a Wayne State University law professor, said the fact that GM cooperated may be why its fine comes in less than Toyota’s. He expects the Justice Department will say it continues to investigate individuals related to the case and that the continuing investigation doesn’t preclude charging individuals. 

“GM reacted,” he said. “Once it became known to senior management, they took steps to address it not only with victims, but also with the government. They were much more forthcoming and essentially it created a template on how to cooperate.” 
 
Obviously, not everyone will be happy with how this ended, especially the family members of the victims who were hoping some people would be prosecuted criminally: 
 
Laura Christian of Harwood, Maryland is the birth mother of Amber Marie Rose, a 16-year-old who was killed in a 2005 crash tied to the ignition switch defect. Christian said she will be greatly disappointed if GM is fined less than Toyota and if nobody from GM is criminally charged. 

“This is one of the worst days since Amber died,” Christian said by phone Wednesday night, nearly in tears. “I was really hoping, really, really hoping that the Justice Department would hold GM accountable.” 
 
2nd Gear: Audi Goes Electric 

 
This year’s Frankfurt Motor Show was all about the future . Mobility, autonomy, technology, and in Audi’s case, electricity. The company revealed they’ll be doing a huge push into the EV realm in the years to come, starting with a production version of the electric crossover they showed off in concept form. 
 
This feels like the natural conclusion of all the various e-tron concepts and experiments they’ve had over the years, but the extent to which they’re going electric might surprise you. From Automotive News , quoting Audi of America President Scott Keogh:  
 
Keogh said that EVs will likely account for a quarter or more of Audi’s U.S. sales in 2030 and beyond, partly based on what the company expects to result with future emissions and fuel economy regulations, including California’s zero-emission vehicle sales requirements. 

For that, Audi will need more EVs. 

“We will need and are actively looking at what is the second” battery-electric vehicle, Keogh said. “There will be more, without a doubt.” 
 
In the meantime, more e-tron hybrids on their way to market, including an A3 and a Q7. 
 
3rd Gear: The 2016 Honda Civic Is A Big Deal 
 
Even in this cheap gas-fueled, crossover-crazy world we find ourselves in, the new 2016 Civic will still be Honda’s bread and butter . But what was once the best and most dependable small car around faces tougher competition than ever compacts, as well as Honda’s own crossovers. Plus, it has to make up for a previous generation that was just meh. From Reuters : 
 
The outgoing Civic, however, was criticized for drab styling and mediocre driving performance. The new car has a more refined interior, sporty creases on its sides and front fenders that rise above the center of the hood like a sports car. 

The Civic is the ninth best-selling model line in the American market this year, but rivals, including the Detroit Three and Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), now have highly competitive cars in the Civic’s class. 
 
4th Gear: Bonuses For Fiat Chrysler Workers To Seal Union Deal 
 
The contract the UAW is working on with Fiat Chrysler will include $3,000 in bonuses if it’s ratified in the next few days, Bloomberg reports: 
 
Union members will receive hourly wage increases of as much as a dollar an hour, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details haven’t been explained to members yet. Senior assembly workers, who now make about $28 an hour, would get raises in two steps that could bring their hourly wage to almost $30, said the person. The newer, or second-tier workers, could earn as much as $25 an hour after eight years of service, said the person. 
 
5th Gear: Senators Ask For Cyber Security Info 
 
Since we’re on the topic of increasingly technologized (is that a word? It is now) cars, what are automakers doing to keep cars secure? That’s what two safety-minded U.S. senators are trying to find out. Via Reuters : 
 
Democratic Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal wrote to 18 automakers on Wednesday asking about efforts taken to secure vehicles including 2015 and 2106 models. They asked automakers how they test electronic components and communications systems to ensure attackers cannot gain access to onboard networks. 

[...] Letter recipients included BMW (BMWG.DE), Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Toyota Motor Co (7203.T) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). 

Security experts have said it will take years for carmakers to plug security holes because they have been adding computers to vehicles for two decades, but only recently started seriously looking for security bugs. 
 
Expect hearings on this soon, probably.

What's This? 


 
Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada likes to tell the story of how his team couldn’t get the first Prius prototype to move for 49 days. According to him, “We had no idea what was wrong, so we worked late every night trying to figure it out. We finally got it to move around Christmas time, but it only went 500 meters!” 
 
That was back in 1995, when hybrid cars were unproven, experimental machines with a very unclear future. Fast-forward 20 years, and Toyota is proud to announce that it has now sold over 8 million hybrid vehicles (including plug-in hybrid vehicles); and it only took them 10 months to get from 7 million to 8 million sales. 
 

 
It can be hard to get a sense of what the number 8 million might mean for the environment and for hybrid owners. For a bit of context, Toyota calculates that as of July 31, its hybrid vehicles have resulted in approximately 58 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions than would have been emitted by petrol-powered vehicles of similar size and driving performance. Toyota also estimates that its hybrid vehicles have saved approximately 22 million kiloliters of petrol compared to the amount used by petrol-powered vehicles of similar sizes. 
 

 
While I’ve encountered many motorists who are still skeptical about hybrids, it goes without saying that hybrids are here to stay, whether you like it or not. Since the launch of the Prius in 1997, Toyota has been gradually adding hybrid models throughout its range, from the compact Yaris Hybrid to the recently announced RAV4 Hybrid. As of August 2015, Toyota sells 30 hybrid passenger car models and one plug-in hybrid model in more than 90 markets, including Malaysia. 
 
The company said that this ongoing hybrid roll-out will only continue, with new hybrid models being added to Toyota’s range and sold in more markets than ever before.

The 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is the perfect vehicle today, in a world with an ever increasing gas prices. 
 
According to Indian Autos Blog , the 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid was unveiled at Europe for the 66th Frankfurt Motor Show and the reception was pleasant. For those thinking that ""green cars"" are pushovers, the compact SUV from Toyota was reportedly equipped with a full hybrid drive system, consisting of a Euro 6 compliant 2.5-litre engine and an electric motor that gives a sufficient 197 horsepower. 
 
As reported by yoursinglesourcefornews , the hybrid RAV4 can go from 0 to 60MPH in just 8.7 seconds, not bad for a vehicle of this size and an eco-friendly engine. As for the emission of the the 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hyrbid, It has yet to be announced as it may vary in other regions, depending on the local rules. 
 
Beside the front-wheel drive variant, an AWD or All-wheel Drive version that features a second, rear-mounted electric motor is also available. The 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid also features an advance Electronic Continuously Variable Transmission system or E-CVT that's run by a Shift-by-Wire technology. 
 
The new Toyota RAV4 Hyrbid interior is also a thing of beauty. The compact SUV has a couple of very useful safety features integrated to it, among them, the notable Panoramic view monitor in which, it allows the driver to get a 360-degree view of the vehicle's surroundings. 
 
But if you think that's neat, it does not end there as it also has a bird's eye view which is useful when changing lanes. maneuvering and parking in tight locations. All of this can be viewed in the infotainment system which features a 7-inch color screen, combined with a 4.2-inch multi-information display. 
 
As for the looks, the 2016 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid looks exactly the same as its gas-operated counterpart. Car and Driver  reports that the new RAV4 Hybrid is expect to go on sale this fall.. What to Make of the VW Crisis?. Hi folks,
I was never much of a Diesel fan. It was the turbo lag in a 2009 VW Golf that got me in trouble in Leipzig and resulted in the car being totaled. But what to make of this episode now in 2015?
First and foremost, we must recognize that with the development of electronic and computer controls related to the internal combustion engine and diesel powered automobiles (which has taken place gradually over the past 20 years or so), there are all kinds of new threats to vehicles that consumers cannot adequately sense or measure. What I mean here is that the owner\/driver is so removed or detached the the technology he or she owns because of digital technological systems, that personal control over the car has been for all intents and purposes lost. My 1971 Porsche 911 and even my 1985 Toyota Corolla have carburetors, and for the most part I can control their performance and emissions by turning idle and mixture screws, setting timing, and ensuring the vacuum systems operate correctly. Not so on todays cars, including the diesels. They are black boxes, programmed by geeks, and not to be touched by a shade tree mechanic. Far from autonomous technologies, they are the product of a ""democratic centralism"" that secedes operation and assumes a kind of technological virtue to the manufacturer whose software is incomprehensible to all but a handful of engineers and computer scientists. In fact, consumers have no way of really knowing what their vehicles are all about.
Much has been said about VW's dishonesty. And it may be that many more of the auto manufacturers practiced similar kinds of strategies to get around government regulators. After all, don't they assume that they are smarter than EPA technicians? It would seem that VW engineers are cats, and EPA analytical chemists are mice?
Is the VW brand hurt beyond repair? Doubtful. If a better product is made, people will buy it. Reminder -- the original bug was Hitler's car!  Diesels now on the decline -- and that is a huge hit for European sales. To put the blame on Martin Winterkorn perhaps specious until investigations are conducted and blame is assigned based on concrete evidence.
Will this be the opening that the green manufacturers like Google are waiting for? Maybe, but petroleum prices need to rise before alternative technologies will flourish.
What does all this dishonesty do for air quality? Yes, some 125+ deaths is the result according to risk experts. And our air (and water for that matter) remains in stress. In sum, the price of our prosperity lead to insults to our public health.

DOUCHEBAG OF THE WEEK: MARTIN SHKRELI!. This has been a monumental week for sky high douchebaggery. There were at least four groups or individuals who on any other given week would have gotten the grand prize. But let's be clear, no one deserved it more than contender for douchebag of the year, Martin Shkreli, CEO of Turing Pharma, who did something few can: united the country no matter race, creed, color or political affiliation in agreeing that this guy is a giant douchebag. Let's see those runner ups for which many are real doozies.
10)Leslie Allen Merrit- This is quite possibly the stupidest man on the face of this Earth. To quote Animal House ""Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life."" He was arrested this week for several of the freeway shootings that took place in Arizona on route 10 these past few months. His defense was a novel one and said that his gun had been in the pawn shop for the last two months. Unfortunately for him, not only do pawn shops keep excellent records (by law they have to), the cops were trailing him the day he pawned the rifle which was just hours before he was arrested. They had the weapon, ballistics and video of him in the pawn shop. Set, game and match. Hope you like prison dumb ass for no real reason as shooting at cars is just stupid on so many levels. What a fool.
9)Buffalo Bills- Right now the Pats are obliterating the Jaguars, 44 to 10. The last two wins by the Pats have been marred by cry baby coaches who got outplayed and grasped at straws to explain how the other team cheated this week. The Steelers blamed the headphones, which was nonsense as the Patriots have no access to the headphones or the network that runs it. The Bills brought up the Patriots ""cheater"" history as to how they won, without explaining of course how they cheated to win. The ironic part is that the Bills DID cheat during the game, as they kept playing music when the Patriots were at the line of scrimmage, a league no no. And they still lost. Losers. I wonder what the Jaguars will come up with to explain their massive loss to a much better team?
8)Lee Daniels- I am not a huge fan of this guy and his latest racist tirade got him into a lot of hot water. While idiotically defending Terrance Howard, a real dirt bag by the way and a screaming prima donna as well who has admitted beating his ex-wife, the director said Howard hasn't done anything Marlon Brando and Sean Penn haven't done as well. The only problem with this inflammatory statement is that it is in no way true. Neither Brando nor Penn have ever been even accused of domestic issues, let alone arrested. Brando is dead so he cannot defend himself but Sean Penn is suing Daniels for ten million dollars for defamation. Good. Couldn't he have picked Ike Turner or Chris Brown instead as an example? Oh that's right, they are both black and he needed a white devil to demonize instead. Next time pick on someone who actually did the thing you accuse them of, stupid.
 
7) Stephen Goddard- The writer for the strangely named RealScience blog, which is a terrible name as it actually contains no real science. I have looked into his allegations of global warming fraud and feel it is no better than Holocaust deniers and the ""evidence"" they collect. His site is filled with graphs that appear made up as they fly in the face of video evidence and what experts have been saying for years. The dumbest thing is he keeps claiming the Arctic, Antarctic and Greenland are all gaining ice, which we can see with our own eyes is not occurring. The fact that so many countries are fighting over Arctic resources as the ice is thinning faster and faster says his research is crap as there is no way they would fight over something they could not get to. This ass is why no one believes anyone or anything anymore and is leading to the destruction of society. F him.
6)Saudi Arabia- This week at least 750 people died during a stampede during the annual trek to Mecca took place. Because of lax security, something they have been warned about many times in the past, hundreds, perhaps a thousand, are dead. And it is not like they don't have the money to adequately fix this which begs the questions ""Why are Jews called cheap and not Arabs?"" This has lead to a lot of problems with Iran pissed at Saudi Arabia and may be in part responsible for clashes in Israel as well. These two sides are never going to get along so maybe we should lock them in a room and let them duke it out once and for all.
5)Carly Fiorina- Thankfully, her rise seems to have stalled, meaning that only 11% of the Republican party is too stupid to vote. Still the worst choice for president, perhaps ever, the media started ripping her a new one this week. Set aside her horrific decisions while CEO, she also committed fraud and treason. She sold parts to Iran while CEO of HP, which was illegal at the time and should have resulted in a criminal probe at the least and also took money from the government meant for job creation and used it for stock buybacks instead, again which got no look at by the SEC even though it was illegal. This bitch has got to go. Also, I see pictures of children pushing for her which should result in them being taken away from the parents for child abuse and neglect. Only an idiot would back this witch who needs to go away. Far, far away.
4)Tea Party Republicans- They anarchists got their wish his week and John Boehner is stepping down from the House at the end of next month. Unfortunately for them, it also means that Obama's budget will most likely pass, perhaps even to the end of his term. The Planned Parenthood shutdown will not happen now and this will save the Republican party from self destructing. Got to give to Boehner, he fell on his sword to save the party. That's brave. Now mind you, by doing this he sets himself up for a cushy job from the establishment for the thanks in doing it, but he also marginalizes the out of control remnants from the Tea Party. If the budget does indeed pass until next December, he will save fallout from an idiotic Congress bent on self destruction. The bad news is that whoever gets the job will fare no better in getting things done without compromise, a non-starter. These fools are hell bent on destroying the government, not fixing it. And that bodes well for no one.
3)Volkswagen- Any other week, these guys would be at the top of the heap. Seems they decided to cheat emission standards by rigging data in their favor. Turns out, their diesel engines are not quite as clean as they claimed. This was done to save money but will instead cost them tens of billions in fines and repairs, not to mention hugely damaging the brand. The CEO was forced to step down and they cannot sell any of the cars that have this defect in it any time soon. I love when companies screw themselves for a few bucks. Contrary to popular belief, greed is not good.
2)Stewart Parnell- This guy took it in the balls this week when the former Peanut CEO got sentenced to 28 years in Federal prison for killing 9 people with tainted peanut butter that he knew was tainted and sold it anyway. What a dick! I am actually stunned he even saw a trial as we usually let CEO's off with a slap on the wrist and a fine for killing people like GE, Bard Inc. and Toyota did to their customers. It didn't help that he emailed everything that nailed him to the wall. As he is 61, this former millionaire is going to die behind bars in a prison with murders, rapists and the scum of society. No country club for him, he will see how hard tough guy prison is not to mention his fortune will disappear in the flood of lawsuits he is looking at. He got what he deserved.
10)Martin Shkreli- The most hated man on Earth has gone into hiding which may be for some time. After hiking a life saving drug for people with cancer and AIDS from $13.50 a pill to $750, Shkreli faced a mountain of bad press from all sides. Normal people were pissed that this asshole was profiting from sick people. Rich people were pissed because their stock portfolio took a major hit when Big Pharma stocks dropped across the board. Big Pharma was REALLY pissed because now everyone is looking at their outrageous prices and screaming bloody murder, making their profits almost certain to drop, especially if new legislation cripples their ability to charge whatever they feel like. This guy could be assassinated from a multitude of people, which no one would cry two seconds over should it happen. Hell, if I was on the jury, that person would walk with a hearty handshake and a big thank you for offing this horrific douche of a human. So congratulations Martin Shkreli, you are indeed douchebag of the week. We will be seeing you again on my douchebag of the year column.. Race Strategy Pays Off for Greg Biffle Crew Chief Matt Puccia with Top-5 Finish and MOOG® 'Problem Solver' Honors at Loudon. Southfield, Michigan, September 29, 2015.Matt Puccia, crew chief for the No. 16 Kleen Performance Products Ford Fusion, rolled the dice by keeping his driver, Greg Biffle, on the track while other teams were opting for fuel and new tires in the final 85 laps of Sunday's Sylvania 300 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Loudon, N.H. The gamble paid off as the 16 car had just enough fuel to coast over the finish line in fourth place. Following the race, Puccia received the prestigious ""Problem Solver of the Race"" crew chief award from MOOG ® , the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Roush-Fenway Racing-owned 16 car, which started 25 th , improved by a race-high 0.389-seconds per lap in earning its third top-five finish of 2015. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
    
Biffle was running 15 th with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the final green-flag segments to finish in the top five. 
 
""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn't have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""Matt absolutely nailed their chassis setup for the final 100 laps. Greg was running on old rubber but was still able to fight off challenges from several drivers."" 
 
Puccia's weekly Problem Solver win - his first - leaves the top of the standings unchanged in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. With eight races remaining, Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Seven crew chiefs have two wins apiece. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

YARPP powered by AdBistro Powered by. Carl Edwards Wins at Darlington, Crew Chief Darian Grubb Earns Second MOOG® ''Problem Solver of the Race'' Award. .Carl Edwards, driver of the No. 19 Arris Toyota Camry, overcame an early two-lap deficit to claim his second NASCAR® Sprint Cup victory of the year and his crew chief, Darian Grubb, earned his second MOOG® Steering and Suspension ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award in Sunday night's Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. MOOG, in its 50th year of Cup competition, is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR.

Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped No. 19 Toyota - featuring a classic 1960s MOOG racing decal on the front fenders - improved by a race-best 0.228-second per lap, helping to advance Edwards into the lead pack near the end of the race.

Grubb's contribution to the win could be seen throughout the race, from the No. 19's methodical 200-lap march toward the front after falling two laps behind, to a dazzling pit stop that gave Edwards a crucial advantage heading into the final eight-lap drag race to the checkered flag. Grubb and the Joe Gibbs Racing crew continually improved the performance of the 19 car's MOOG-equipped chassis and NASCAR's low-downforce configuration, ultimately giving Edwards the fastest and best handling car for the final green-flag run.

""Carl is one of the most vocal advocates of the low-downforce package, and we saw why tonight,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""That configuration puts more pressure on the crew chief to nail the chassis setup and the driver to be as aggressive as possible. Darian gave Carl the best car when it mattered most, and he certainly earned our weekly MOOG Problem Solver award.""

Grubb's latest Problem Solver win elevates him into a six-way tie for second place in the battle for the $100,000MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. Leading in the standings with three weekly wins apiece are crew chiefs Greg Ives (No. 88 Chevrolet, Dale Earnhardt Jr.) and Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award through the first 25 Cup races.

In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends.

Susan Fisher (Federal-Mogul Motorparts) - 248.354.. VW to U.S. dealers: Halt sales of some '15 diesel cars. A company spokeswoman on Saturday didn't immediately say how many vehicles are covered by the stop sale… A company spokeswoman on Saturday didn't immediately say how many vehicles are covered by the stop sale order 

Washington —Volkswagen of America told its dealers Saturday to halt sales of remaining 2015 diesel cars with 2.0 liter engines after federal officials said the automaker had intentionally evaded emissions requirements. 

The Detroit News reported late Friday that VW dealers still had some 2015 diesel Jetta, Passat and Beetle cars for sale. A company spokeswoman on Saturday didn't immediately say how many vehicles are covered by the stop sale order. 

The Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board said the German automaker deliberately evaded federal emissions requirements in nearly a half-million diesel cars in the U.S. since 2009 by writing vehicle software to only activate anti-pollution controls during testing. 

The device allowed the German automaker to evade requirements in selling 482,000 diesel 2009-2015 Volkswagen Jetta, Passat, Sportwagen, Beetle and Audi A3 cars with 2.0-liter engines, and let them to emit 10 to 40 times allowable pollution, environmental officials allege. That action, they said, is illegal and a public health threat. 

EPA said VW violated federal law and, in theory, could face fines of up to $18 billion — $37,500 per vehicle — as well as criminal prosecution. Both agencies issued notices of non-compliance to VW Friday, a step necessary before ordering a recall. 

VW said it is cooperating with the government, but didn’t say if it has admitted wrongdoing. The automaker is on track to surpass Toyota to become the world’s largest automaker this year. On Friday, the company removed many videos from YouTube and other social websites touting its clean diesel efforts. 

Christopher Grundler, director of the EPA’s Office of Transportation of Air Quality, said in an interview Friday that the government agency took the unusual step of refusing to grant VW a “certificate of conformity” to sell 2016 model diesel cars with 2.0-liter diesel engines. VW dealers have been waiting for the 2016 models to replenish showrooms. 

Most U.S. VW dealers don’t have any remaining 2015 diesel cars to sell. VW is barred from selling 2016 model vehicles with the 2.0 liter diesel engine until “they get answers to the questions of how these vehicles are being operated. Volkswagen couldn’t explain why we’re getting these excess emissions,” Grundler said. 

Grundler said it is “incomprehensible” how the world’s largest automaker could install “defeat devices” to evade emissions requirements. He said the EPA doesn’t know if VW will be able to fix the problem with a software upgrade, or needs to make a mechanical fix. The models under investigation cover two separate generations of diesel engines with separate systems for removing pollutants. 

The agency said the vehicles’ software intentionally detects when the car is undergoing official emissions testing, “and turns full emissions controls on only during the test.” When vehicles are being driven normally, the computer disables the emissions controls. 

Analysts speculated that there are only two advantages to such a device: VW may have wanted to get higher fuel economy for the cars or avoid more expensive emissions controls like those on larger diesel VWs built during the timeframe. 

The announcement is a big setback to the German automaker, which has made diesels a big part of its U.S. strategy. Diesels last year accounted for nearly 22 percent of VW-brand U.S. sales. Friday’s announcement came as VW plans a high-profile event in New York City on Monday with singer Lenny Kravitz to show off its new Passat. 

The Justice Department is likely to open a criminal investigation, if it hasn’t already. 

The EPA said it “expects to compel VW to issue …. VW Emissions Scandal: Motor Industry Reaction. Here are their responses: 
 
:: Toyota 
 
‘Toyota does not engage in any practice that would seek to enhance emissions performance of its engines during regulated emissions testing or homologation cycles, nor does it use any practice that would make engine performance different during these tests.’ 
 
:: Vauxhall 
 
‘GM and its brands are committed to the robust emissions compliance of all our vehicles. 
 
‘Specifically, we do not have ‘defeat devices’ in vehicles we engineer and manufacture. 
 
‘We expect our employees to be informed and act legally and ethically, without exception.’ 
 
:: PSA Peugeot Citroen 
 
‘PSA’s Research & Development Department reaffirms that PSA complies with the approval procedures in effect in all countries where it operates, and that engine settings, assuming the same conditions of use, are identical whether for approval procedures or in real life. 
 
‘Further, PSA notes that the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system installed on all its Euro 6 diesel vehicles produces variances that are among the lowest in the automotive industry between approved emissions and those arising from customer use.’ 
 
:: Daimler (Mercedes-Benz) 
 
‘We heard of the EPA’s [US Environmental Protection Agency] accusations against VW from the press. 
 
‘The issue described by the press does not apply to Mercedes-Benz Cars.’ 
 
:: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders 
 
‘The UK automotive industry understands the concerns consumers may have following the actions of one manufacturer in regard to emissions testing and the subsequent decision to recall a large number of its cars. 
 
‘This is, however, an issue affecting just one company and there is no evidence to suggest that any other company is involved, let alone that this is an industry-wide issue. 
 
‘Consumers should be reassured that cars sold in the UK must comply with strict European laws. 
 
‘All cars must complete a standard emissions test, which, unlike in the US, is independently witnessed by a government-appointed independent agency. 
 
‘On the separate ongoing debate about real world testing, industry accepts that the current test method for cars is out of date and is seeking agreement from the European Commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and which is more representative of on-road conditions.’ 
 
:: European Commission spokesperson Lucia Caudet 
 
‘We are taking the matter very seriously.  Investigations are ongoing within Volkswagen as well as in the US and in Germany. 
 
‘Therefore, it is premature to comment on whether any specific immediate surveillance measures are also necessary in Europe and the implications for vehicles sold by Volkswagen in Europe. 
 
‘But let me be clear: we need to get to the bottom of this. 
 
‘For the sake of our consumers and the environment, we need certainty that industry scrupulously respects emissions limits.’

HUG#1955450. 2016 Toyota Prius revealed. The iconic hybrid runs on a new chassis and is more efficient 
Perhaps the most interesting part about the fourth-generation Prius isn’t the hybrid aspect. Sure, that looks like being beefed up, but it’s what is underneath that is gaining the most attention. 

The new Prius is the first iteration of a new modular platform that in the future will be found under a great many Toyotas in one form or another. The Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) should allow for new models being created in a shorter timeframe and with less cost than before. This flexible platform should mean lower prices for the consumer and shorter development times. It will be flexible in terms of the options it can offer, but at the same time it should add between 30% and 65% to the rigidity of the vehicle. 

In that architecture in the Prius sits new double-wishbone suspension at the rear and a MacPherson set-up at the front end. The power too has been revised and upgraded. Expect an updated 1.8-litre petrol unit and electric motor, with a more compact battery giving quicker charge times. There is the possibility of fuel and emission numbers falling yet further. If that improves by 10% then we’re looking at the Prius coming under the magic number of 80g\/km of CO2. 

The other number that matters, the price, is likely to be around £22,000, roughly the same as the current model, with deliveries starting in early 2016. 
Honda unveils single-seat racer to rival the Ariel Atom Contact the Chester Chronicle Send a story The Editor Journalists. ITM Power launches UK’s first public hydrogen fuel station. () is today launching the first public access hydrogen refuelling station, just off the M1 in South Yorkshire. 
 

	It is the first station of its kind in the United Kingdom. The station, which is supported by Innovate UK, has also been upgraded to showcase ITM’s hydrogen generation equipment. And it will provide retail hydrogen fuel services. 
 

	This launch comes after last week’s breakthrough announcement that ITM is to site three hydrogen refuelling stations on Shell forecourts in London. 
 

	The M1 station is located at the Advanced Manufacturing , near Sheffield, and the launch is being supported by Hyundai, Toyota, and Honda which will be displaying their fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV). 
 

	Specifically, the event will showcase the Hyundai Ix35, the Toyota Mirai, the Honda FCX Clarity and a British Microcab. 
 

	Dr Graham Cooley, ITM’s chief executive, said: ""We are extremely pleased to be launching the first of the company's hydrogen refuelling stations today, at this very accessible location off the M1 in South Yorkshire, and to provide clean fuel for the fuel cell electric vehicles that are now available from the auto OEMs.” 
 

	“Following the strategic forecourt siting agreement last week with Shell, this station will provide important reference for demystifying the ability to utilise renewable energy supply for its efficient conversion to clean fuel for clean transport emissions.” 
 

	’s electrolyser technology converts excess electricity into hydrogen. 
 

	Unlike conventional fuel powered vehicles, FCEVs only expel a mixture of water vapour and air. The latest vehicle models can run for hundreds of miles and be re-fuelled in minutes. 
 

	The M1 station hosts a 225kW wind turbine, an electrolyser, a 220kg of hydrogen storage facility and a 30kW fuel cell system which can provide back-up power for nearby buildings. 
 

	""It is very encouraging indeed that the UK's hydrogen filling station infrastructure is developing. We welcome this ultra-green new site in the north of England, which will serve a very large area and is clearly one of the most advanced sites ever constructed,” said Tony Whitehorn, chief executive of Hyundai Motor UK. 
 

	“This new self-sufficient filling station is exactly what's needed."" 
 

	Jon Hunt, of Toyota & Lexus Fleet Marketing, meanwhile, said: “Toyota is delighted to congratulate and join  at the opening of the new M1 refuelling station. 
 

	“A project that will support the October launch into the UK of our new Mirai, the world's first dedicated mass produced hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle."" 
 

	Thomas Brachmann, of  Europe, added: “As a company Honda has  been at the forefront of the introduction of fuel cell electric vehicles, and we are enthusiastic to see refuelling infrastructure being deployed that especially includes on-site production of hydrogen from renewable sources of energy.""

SOURCE  Research and Markets. GM's 2002 - 1975 Opel 1900 Ascona Fuel Injection. GM’s 2002 – 1975 Opel 1900 Ascona Fuel Injection Have you found yourself moaning about the bubble in Opel GT prices lately? Has it got to the point where it seems like only one percenters can afford anything less than a complete rust bucket project? Well, even if you were bemoaning the new cost of , Opel was thinking of the budget-minded classic car enthusiast over 40 years ago when it released the 1900. With around 81hp net, a live rear axle and independent front suspension on coil springs, and rack and pinion steering, it was praised at the time for its good handling. The 1900 Coupe (or Manta) compared favorably to the Mercury Capri, Toyota Celica and Mazda RX-2, and its character was favorably compared to other higher-end German cars. Check out this 1975 Opel 1900 Ascona for sale for $3000 in Gresham, OR. It’s a smart-looking (if conservative) box, and while the bumpers are not a pretty sight, a previous owner has removed the rubber strip on the face and polished them. The seller’s description of the vehicle’s running condition is simple – “great condition. This is a very nice car.” We also get to know that it runs on gas, so that’s useful if you were not a fan of the non-existent diesel and propane versions. In a way, the styling is very GM, but with a European twist and proportions. It’s strange GM saw fit to sell this at the same time as the Vega and friends, as this was roundly recognized to be a much better car in many ways. It’s nice that this is the fuel injected version – drivability should be improved over the carburetted cars, and horsepower went up slightly after declining for emissions reasons through the early 1970s. Some higher compression pistons, electronic ignition and upgraded exhaust might help you reach 2002 levels. With front discs and rear drums, stopping should be easy too. Here’s the 1.9-liter cam-in-head engine, looking decent but not with any obviously new parts. Unfortunately, you’ll be stuck with a 3-speed Automatik-Getriebe, though you might still get a manual from one of the domestic Opel parts houses. Of course, let’s not forget this is a good way for people unable to drive a manual to stay or get into the hobby. Either way, with the large European aftermarket for Mantas, performance upgrades for things like the engine and suspension should be readily available, and for now, you have a fun, unique and simple little runabout.

Kurt Busch Crew Chief Tony Gibson is Top MOOG® 'Problem Solver' in Chase Opener at Chicagoland Speedway. Southfield, Michigan, September 22, 2015.Tony Gibson, crew chief for Kurt Busch and the No. 41 Haas Automation Chevrolet SS, won the MOOG ® Steering and Suspension brand's ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award after Busch finished third in Sunday's myAFibRisk400.com 400 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup event at Chicagoland Speedway, Joliet, Ill. Gibson's win, coming in the opening round of the 10-race Chase for the Sprint Cup, moves him into a six-way tie for third place in the MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" standings. MOOG is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by global vehicle components manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver Award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped 41 car improved by a race-high 0.529-seconds per lap on the mile-and-a-half oval. 
    
Busch, who started ninth, ran in the lead pack for most of the afternoon. He had advanced to fifth within the first 60 laps before being forced onto pit road after losing air in a tire and making contact with the wall. He quickly regained the lost ground and was running second after passing his brother, Kyle Busch (No. 18 Toyota), on Lap 147. The 41 car briefly led on Lap 222 before a scheduled pit stop, then regained the lead on Lap 245.  Busch ultimately lost out to the MOOG-equipped No. 11 and 19 Toyotas of Denny Hamlin and Carl Edwards, respectively, in the final five-lap green flag run, with Hamlin picking up his second win of the year.

HUG#1953829. New 2016 Toyota Prius confirmed for Frankfurt show debut. Toyota has announced it will be pulling the wraps off its all-new Prius at this month's Frankfurt Motor Show. Set to go on sale early next year, it gets styling inspired by the Mirai and is likely to be the most efficient model in the firm's range.

The firm has released a very subtle teaser showing the rear light design, but it doesn't give much away. These spy images shots suggest a cleaner, more aerodynamic front is to be expected, with Mirai FCV-inspired headlights and bumpers. At the back, the sloping roof meets a high-lipped spoiler, with a Honda Civic-style split screen.

This Prius is set to be more slippery than at present, and one of the most efficient cars on sale. Earlier this year Toyota product manager Richard Lacey told us it’ll be “better than the current Yaris Hybrid”, indicating sub-75g\/km CO2 Image 3 of 12

It's expected that the Prius will be offered in a variety of trim styles for the first time – with the Plug-In adopting a darker front bumper and sharper lines for the LED running lights. Different alloy designs will further set them apart.

The next Prius is the first in a line of Toyota and Lexus products to use the global TNGA platform, underpinning everything from the new Yaris to future SUVs.

The first model to be based on a new TNGA platform – Toyota’s answer to the Volkswagen Group’s MQB architecture – the new Prius will be significantly more efficient, feature a lower centre of gravity for improved handling and move upmarket with four-wheel drive. Image 5 of 12

Style-wise, slimmer headlights, LED ‘eyebrows’ and a wider lower intake will transform the front end, and are the latest in a series of bold design moves from Toyota. The company is beginning to shrug off its reputation for drab design with stunning concepts like the FT-1 Supra successor and bold production models like the new Aygo and GT86.

With an all-new platform to work with, Toyota’s engineers have been free to develop a clean-sheet hybrid synergy drive powertrain. The new configuration will bring an improvement in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions, to around 90mpg and 70g\/km, and while the front wheels will still be driven by a 1.8-litre petrol engine and a downsized electric motor, the rear axle will also be powered by an electric motor. 

The so-called ‘e-4WD’ system will only work at speeds of up to 37mph, Auto Express has learned, but will boost grip in poor weather conditions.

One of Toyota’s major dilemmas has been deciding whether to stick with cheaper but bulkier nickel-metal hydride batteries, as used in the current Prius, or upgrading to lithium-ion cells. It’s believed the four-wheel-drive system and significant interior quality upgrades have helped to justify the extra costs of lithium-ion. As a result of the more premium mechanical package, the Prius could move upmarket slightly, starting from around £25,000, leaving the Auris and Yaris hybrids for those on a tighter budget.

A new Prius Plug-in will also be introduced next year, featuring a small boost in the electric-only range of 15.5 miles and an incremental improvement on the current economy and emissions figures of 134mpg and 49g\/km. These will come from upgrades to the lithium-ion battery pack, aerodynamics and friction losses in the powertrain.. FEDERAL MOGUL : Race Strategy Pays Off for Greg Biffle Crew Chief Matt Puccia with Top-5 Finish and MOOG® 'Problem Solver' Honors at Loudon. Southfield, Michigan , September 29 , 2015. Matt Puccia , crew chief for the No. 16
Kleen Performance Products Ford Fusion, rolled the dice by keeping his driver, Greg Biffle , on the track while other teams were opting for fuel and new tires
in the final 85 laps of Sunday's Sylvania 300 NASCAR (®) Sprint Cup race at New
Hampshire Motor Speedway , Loudon, N.H. The gamble paid off as the 16 car had
just enough fuel to coast over the finish line in fourth place. Following the
race, Puccia received the prestigious ""Problem Solver of the Race"" crew chief
award from MOOG(®), the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR .

Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: FDML ), the
weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers
the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the
lead lap. The Roush-Fenway Racing -owned 16 car, which started 25(th), improved
by a race-high 0.389-seconds per lap in earning its third top-five finish of
2015. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota
Camry.

Biffle was running 15(th) with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish
without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle
to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps
to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the
final green-flag segments to finish in the top five.

""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn't
have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson , director of
motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""Matt absolutely nailed their chassis
setup for the final 100 laps. Greg was running on old rubber but was still able
to fight off challenges from several drivers.""

Puccia's weekly Problem Solver win - his first - leaves the top of the standings
unchanged in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year""
Award. With eight races remaining, Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin
Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/ Paul Menard ) with three. Seven crew chiefs have two
wins apiece.

The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension
components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup
teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends.

[HUG#1955450] 
© Thomson Reuters, source US Press Releases. Despite cheap gas, Toyota launching fuel cell car. DETROIT - Toyota will be launching its Mirai fuel cell car soon in California in the teeth of falling gas prices, a paltry network of hydrogen fueling stations and media infatuation with Tesla that is finally expected to build salable version of its much-delayed Model X SUV.

There are only a handful of hydrogen stations up and running in the Golden State, but the California Fuel Cell Partnership has plans for 40 stations to operate by the end of 2016 and 100 by 2020. The state of California is spending about $20 million a year on the project.

""We like fuel cells because it is the lightest solution,"" said Chris Hostetter, Toyota group vice president of strategic planning. ""It has cost advantages over electric vehicles because we are making the electricity on board rather than pulling it from the grid.""

Toyota is not the first to bring a hydrogen fuel cell car to market. Honda sold a handful of its FCX Clarity fuel cell cars between 2008 and this year, but it ended production with the 2015 model year. It is expected to launch another fuel cell model sometime in the next two years. Hyundai recently launched a fuel cell version of its Tucson in 2013 it has sold only about 300 so far.

But Toyota is making a very aggressive bet that fuel cell vehicles could over time equal or surpass plug-in electric hybrids in consumer acceptance.

The Mirai was conceived about the same time as the Prius gas-electric hybrid, in the early 1990s.

The sales goals in the U.S. are modest. With only 200 to 300 being shipped by the end of this year, with a goal of selling 3,000 in this country by the end of 2017.

At a sticker price of $58,250 before tax credits, Mirai won't be inexpensive, but most early customers are expected to lease it for about $500 a month. And Toyota is kicking in three years or $15,000 worth of hydrogen which has recently sold in the range of $7 to $13 per kilogram.

The only emission is water.

Next year there will be another set of fueling stations funded by Toyota and partner Air Liquide that will stretch from New Jersey through New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

Range of Mirai at one fill is 312 miles, while an optional power take off feature that can deliver up to 9 kilowatts of power (60 kWh total), enough for emergency situations.

CARBON FOOTPRINT DEBATE?

At first glimpse the car looks distinctive, and some will say, strange. The front hood is wrapping with a belt-like edge that elevates it from the grille which is highlighted by two trapezoids sitting beneath the narrow head lamp slits. From the rear Mirai appears more mainstream.

For the first-adopter eco-conscious consumer, there is debate about whether the Mirai is actually casting a smaller carbon foot print than most plug-in electric vehicles.

""The challenge for hydrogen vehicles is that in terms carbon footprint they are much cleaner than gasoline cars, but they are nowhere near as clean as plug-in cars,"" said John Voelcker, senior editor of Green Car Reports.

One kilowatt hour of electricity can be used to recharge a battery that, in turn, powers a car. Or you can create one kilowatt hour of electricity by refining hydrogen from a feed stock, most commonly natural gas, which is extracted from a well or through hydraulic fracturing. That hydrogen then is compressed and fed into a fuel cell to create electricity, but losing about 40 percent of the hydrogen in the process, Voelcker said.

""For the same kilowatt-hour of electricity you're getting about a third as many miles from the fuel car vehicle,"" he said.

But hydrogen wins from a convenience perspective. If you're near a fueling station it's just as quick as filling up with gasoline or diesel.

The carbon footprint equation also can change if the hydrogen is created from renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines.

As with the Prius, Mirai is not driven by a short-term business case. It won't be sexy. Silicon Valley media star and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk has dismissed the technology as ""fool"" cells.

Because Toyota has such a broad product portfolio and is currently the most profitable mainstream automaker, it has the patience to see whether hydrogen mobility works in the long run.

""Toyota really doesn't have high financial expectations for Mirai. It is not positioned at a Tesla killer,"" said Mike Millikin, editor of the Green Car Congress. ""It's a significant step in a long-term strategy.""

To underscore how incremental the marketing of Mirai is, Toyota is interviewing prospective owners to make sure they live within a feasible distance from a fueling station. Driving along I-5 from the Mexican border to Oregon probably won't work, at least until there are more than a few stations along that route.

Than again, this is about yet another option in our growing menu of mobility options.

""Germany sees it. Most of the Scandanavian countries see it,"" Hostetter said. ""In Japan the government is very strongly behind it, partly because of the backlash against nuclear power after Fukushima,"" referring to the nuclear plant that was destroyed by the tsunami of March 2011.

Southfield, Michigan, September 9, 2015.Carl Edwards, driver of the No. 19 Arris Toyota Camry, overcame an early two-lap deficit to claim his second NASCAR ® Sprint Cup victory of the year and his crew chief, Darian Grubb, earned his second MOOG ® Steering and Suspension ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award in Sunday night's Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. MOOG, in its 50 th year of Cup competition, is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
    
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped No. 19 Toyota - featuring a classic 1960s MOOG racing decal on the front fenders - improved by a race-best 0.228-second per lap, helping to advance Edwards into the lead pack near the end of the race. 
 
Grubb's contribution to the win could be seen throughout the race, from the No. 19's methodical 200-lap march toward the front after falling two laps behind, to a dazzling pit stop that gave Edwards a crucial advantage heading into the final eight-lap drag race to the checkered flag. Grubb and the Joe Gibbs Racing crew continually improved the performance of the 19 car's MOOG-equipped chassis and NASCAR's low-downforce configuration, ultimately giving Edwards the fastest and best handling car for the final green-flag run. 
 
""Carl is one of the most vocal advocates of the low-downforce package, and we saw why tonight,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""That configuration puts more pressure on the crew chief to nail the chassis setup and the driver to be as aggressive as possible. Darian gave Carl the best car when it mattered most, and he certainly earned our weekly MOOG Problem Solver award."" 
 
Grubb's latest Problem Solver win elevates him into a six-way tie for second place in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. Leading in the standings with three weekly wins apiece are crew chiefs Greg Ives (No. 88 Chevrolet, Dale Earnhardt Jr.) and Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard). Fifteen different crew chiefs have won the weekly MOOG Problem Solver award through the first 25 Cup races. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

Air pollution is a major issue on Goan roads with fuel emission from automobiles a major cause of poor air quality. So it is great to come across news of electric and hybrid cars with manufacturers declaring intentions to roll out more of it. 
 
It is a segment of the four-wheeler market that is expected to see some action soon due to government encouragement as well as consciousness among users for environment friendly vehicles. Several car buyers are also open to making the switch from petrol and diesel guzzlers to clean fuel vehicles albeit if the vehicles are affordable and there is value for money. 
 
Recently Maruti Suzuki launched the Ciaz Hybrid with most attractive pricing. The new Ciaz has a hybrid system on a 1.3 litre diesel engine. The technology for it is imported and expensive but thanks to incentives given by the government Maruti is able to offset the high import cost. 
 
The hybrid Ciaz replaces the diesel variants of the model and encouraging response to it augurs well for future hybrid models from manufacturers. 
 
Unfortunately demand for electric cars in India is at a nascent stage due to the prohibitive price-tag and problems related charging of batteries. Concerns are on the life of the battery and on the ability of the car to run long distances. Moreover existing market for electric cars remains in the cities as discouraged by lackluster response manufacturers have not even tried to push it in interior regions. 
 
Meanwhile in Goa the track record of electric cars is a notch lower than metro cities. Ground level check reveals that of the four existing hybrid cars in the market none are present in showrooms. The cars Mahindra E20, Toyota Prius, Toyota Camry and BMW i8 have been around for some time but can be purchased through prior bookings. The oldest electric car on Goan is the Reva that is re-launched as Mahindra E20 after change in ownership. 
 
The Mahindra E20 has found hardly any riders in Goa due to lack of awareness of buyers. Mahindra has recently slashed the price of this car by Rs 92,000 after incentives from the government and the manager at Mukhtar Automobiles, Margao reveals that lower price may boost demand. 
 
Similarly there are no buyers for the Toyota Prius and Camry, says Goa dealer Sharayu Toyota because locals have little knowledge of benefits of hybrid car. Both the cars are with automatic and one of the reasons for lack of market is the price, concedes the dealer source. The cars though are extremely efficient but buyers tend to consider the high pricing vis-à-vis the technological superiority. 
 
The BMW i8 is also not seen on Goan roads.  Government incentives to hybrid cars are through lower excise duty of 12.5 per cent and subsidy extension of Rs 12,000- Rs 13,000 under electric and hybrid vehicle policy of FAME. Internationally automobile lovers are making the switch to electric cars but Goan drives have yet to catch on to it is the opinion from dealers end.. Toyota Yaris Hybrid makes your motoring life easy. Toyota have taken the stress out of hybrid motoring with their excellent Yaris…  
Toyota have taken the stress out of hybrid motoring with their excellent Yaris supermini. 

TOYOTA are masters of the hybrid car – after all, they have been making them since 1997 and they introduced them to the UK in 2000. 

Where they went so confidently, others followed. So although it is surprising to learn that in 2014 almost a third of all Yaris sales were hybrids, it is not a shock. 

And while the Toyota hybrid offers all the advantages of fantastic mpg and incredibly low emissions, it is also a stunning supermini that has been carefully restyled for a more elegant and refined look and feel. 

And it is a hybrid that does not need lots of looking after. There is no cable that has to be plugged in to charge the battery, no searching around looking for an appropriate point in the city. 

The Yaris has a 1.5-litre petrol engine that you fill up as normal at a regular forecourt and it works with the battery forming a kind of synergy that allows you to drive in electric mode, or petrol and electric. 

Take your foot off the gas and the energy is used to charge the battery, similarly when you brake. 

The car does this all seamlessly and you will only notice the petrol engine when it kicks in. 

The car determines the most efficient use of your powertrain for the best possible balance of power and efficiency. 

And cleverly, Toyota’s experts have made the battery much smaller, which means it can be placed under the rear seats. 

This means that the hybrid Yaris now has as much space and roominess as its more traditional stablemates. 

The Yaris has always been something of a fun car, with quirky little touches such the instruments in the centre of the dash. 

Now, however, it has grown up both inside and out. 

The neat little snub nose features the chrome kiss – that’s where the two chrome lines meet at the Toyota badge – which in the hybrid gets a blue background. 

There is also a floating spoiler under the lower deep grille and, at the rear, a new bumper design has an integral diffuser. 

At a glance, it is low and sporty with bags of kerbside appeal. 

Inside, Toyota have listened to customers and really …. New Toyota RAV4 Hybrid unveiled at Frankfurt motor show. Toyota will take its full hybrid technology into the highly competitive European compact SUV segment for the first time with the 2016 launch of the new RAV4 Hybrid. Both front and all-wheel drive versions will be available, powered by a hybrid system that uses a 2.5-litre Atkinson cycle petrol engine and a powerful electric motor. The AWD model has an additional electric motor at the rear that provides extra traction and a 1,650kg towing capability, without the added weight and complexity of central prop shaft. Total system output is 195bhp\/145kW, giving seamless acceleration from rest to 62mph in 8.7 seconds. Combined cycle fuel consumption is a class-leading 57.7mpg, while CO2 emissions are from a highly tax-efficient 115g\/km (figures subject to homologation). The hybrid leads a revised, Euro 6-compliant engine line-up for RAV4. This includes a new 2.0-litre D-4D turbodiesel offering 141bhp\/105kW and a substantial 320Nm of torque, while at the same time targeting 123g\/km CO2 emissions. There is also an improved 149bhp\/11kW 2.0-litre Valvematic petrol unit that is already on sale and available with a choice of manual transmission or CVT (CVT only in the UK). This musters 195Nm of torque and CO2 emissions from 149g\/km. Going beyond the smooth and refined Toyota hybrid driving experience, the new RAV4 further benefits from improved ride comfort, dynamic performance and cabin quietness. There are also smart changes to the exterior design, higher levels of sensory quality in the interior, improved equipment functionality and innovations in safety and the application of advanced technology. The introduction of Toyota Safety Sense provides a package of new active safety systems. A new panoramic view monitor is also available, providing a bird’s eye view of the vehicle’s immediate surroundings, making parking and low-speed manoeuvring easier. Inside, there is a new 4.2-inch multi-information screen set between the meters in the instrument binnacle and a seven-inch, full-colour centre console display, incorporating the Toyota Touch 2 multimedia system. RAV4 heritage Toyota can rightfully claim to have created the compact SUV market with the introduction of the first Recreational Active Vehicle with 4-wheel drive – RAV4 – in 1994. The model’s debut at that year’s Geneva motor show revealed it as something quite different to a traditional 4×4. First offered as a compact (3,595mm-long) three-door, this original urban SUV was powered by a relatively small, transverse-mounted 2.0-litre engine. It featured independent suspension all round, and a monocoque chassis rather than the then-familiar SUV body-on-frame construction. In that first year Toyota sold 53,000 RAV4; in 1995 the figure doubled, then tripled the year after that. Annual sales have since grown steadily with each successive generation, transforming RAV4 from a niche model into a global car. By 2013 its annual sales figures were 10 times greater than in 1994. See also: History of the Toyota RAV4 Today RAV4 is sold in 170 countries around the world; since launch, more than six million have reached the road, 1.5 million of these in Europe. At the same time, the compact SUV market has changed and matured. Customers originally bought these models as an alternative to sporty hatchbacks and coupes, but today sales growth is driven by families who want an engaging, fashionable, yet practical alternative to MPVs and estate cars. Hybrid powertrain RAV4 Hybrid’s full hybrid system comprises a 2.5-litre Atkinson cycle petrol engine, a powerful electric motor, a generator, a 204-cell nickel-metal hydride battery (located beneath the rear seats), a power control unit and a power split device. On the AWD version there is a second, rear-mounted electric motor that provides electric all-wheel drive (E-four). This system avoids the added weight, cost and complexity of a mechanical system with a central prop shaft. Total system output is 195bhp\/145kW, giving nought to 62mph acceleration in 8.7 seconds and a top speed of 112mph. Combined cycle fuel consumption is a class-leading 57.7mpg and CO2 emissions are a tax-efficient 115g\/km (figures subject to homologation). The hybrid system uses power from the engine and electric motor in tandem, or from the electric motor alone, maximising the efficiency of both sources to achieve the best balance of driving performance and fuel economy. During deceleration and under braking, the electric motors act as a high-output generator to provide regenerative braking – kinetic energy that would normally be lost as heat as the vehicle slows or brakes is recovered as electrical energy and stored in a high-performance battery. The seamless, E-CVT electric continuously variable transmission uses shift-by-wire control, via an electronic shift lever. The driver can select from four drive modes which tailor hybrid system performance to suit driving conditions or personal preference. They include an EV mode, which gives near-silent running over short distances on electric power alone, with zero fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions – ideal for slow urban traffic conditions. The system is designed to eliminate use of the petrol engine as much as possible when driving in city traffic. Toyota’s own data show that the cumulative effect of full hybrid operation leads to a high proportion of zero emissions EV driving. E-Four electric AWD In a first for a Toyota vehicle in Europe, the RAV4 Hybrid AWD is equipped with a 50kW high-voltage, high-speed rear electric motor, which gives the vehicle all-wheel drive capability without the need for a central prop shaft. Called E-Four, this works independently from the front electric motor and drives the rear wheels alone. The vehicle will switch smoothly and automatically to all-wheel drive when travelling on slippery road surfaces or when pulling away from stationary, maximising traction, stability and controllability. E-Four generates drive torque by making efficient use of power from the vehicle’s hybrid system, not only optimising all-wheel drive performance in different driving conditions, but also reducing energy losses, helping RAV4 Hybrid achieve better fuel economy than is usually associated with AWD vehicles. The extra traction provided by E-Four also gives RAV4 Hybrid a 1,650kg towing capacity, one of the highest achieved by any hybrid vehicle. Improved driving feel, sequential Shiftmatic and Power mode The control logic in RAV4 Hybrid’s transmission has been designed to give a smooth, natural feeling under acceleration, with a close match between vehicle speed and engine revs, creating a more pleasant and engaging driving experience. A more sporting drive is on offer thanks the addition of a sequential Shiftmatic gear change function and a selectable Power drive mode. When the driver uses sequential shifting, engine braking force is increased and, because engine revs are kept higher than in the normal “D” drive position, throttle response is sharper. When Power mode is selected, traction force is increased. Driving dynamics The new RAV4 benefits from numerous measures to improve ride comfort and driver involvement, without sacrificing stability or controllability. The number of spot welds on the rear cross-member support has been increased from 105 to 138 and patches have been added to the rear suspension member and floor cross-member. The resulting increase in rear bodyshell rigidity not only improves vehicle stability, it also allows for better harshness damping, which in turn gives better ride quality. The new RAV4 retains a Macpherson strut front and lightweight trailing arm double wishbone rear suspension set-up, but the shock absorbers and springs have been revised to give a flatter, more comfortable ride and better straight-line stability. The steering rack has more rigid fastening points, giving a better steering feel. A quieter cabin Noise, vibration and harshness levels have been comprehensively improved, with an emphasis on comfort for rear seat passengers and making it easier to hold a conversation in the cabin when on the move. Detailed measures include increasing the surface area of the floor silencer by 55 per cent; reshaping the rear finish plate; and adding sound absorbing material in locations around the rear deck to reduce road, tyre and exhaust noise. Extra sound-absorbing material and an outer insulator on the door trim work to cut wind and road noise. The instrument panel silencer has been made larger to reduce the transmission of engine noise into the cabin. Advanced safety technology The new RAV4 adopts the Toyota Safety Sense package of active technologies to help prevent or mitigate a collision in different traffic situations. They include a radar-controlled Pre-Collision System with a Pedestrian Detection function, Lane Departure Alert, Adaptive Cruise Control, Road Sign Assist and Automatic High Beam. The Pre-Collision System operates from around 6mph up to the vehicle’s top speed. It monitors the road ahead and if it detects the risk of a collision it prompts the driver to brake with visual and audible warnings. It also primes the brakes to provide extra stopping force when the driver presses the brake pedal. If the driver doesn’t respond to the alerts, the system will automatically apply the brakes, reducing vehicle speed by about 25mph, or potentially even bringing the car to a complete stop, to prevent a collision or reduce the force of impact. The system can also detect potential collisions with pedestrians, in the event of which automated braking will operate at relative speeds of between 6 and 49mph, reducing vehicle speed by about 19mph. Adaptive Cruise Control helps the driver maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, using the same millimetre radar as the Pre-Collision System to detect vehicles ahead and determine their speed. It then adjusts the Toyota’s speed (within a set range) to ensure a safe distance between both vehicles. When the road ahead is clear, the system smoothly accelerates back to the selected cruising speed. This makes for smoother acceleration and deceleration in the ebb and flow of traffic. The Lane Departure Alert system monitors lane markings on the road and helps prevent accidents and head-on collisions caused by a vehicle leaving its lane. If the vehicle starts to deviate from its lane without the turn indicators being used, the system alerts the driver with visual and audible warnings. Road Sign Assist keeps drivers informed, even if they have driven past a road sign without noticing. It recognises signage such as speed limits and “no overtaking” warnings, and displays the information on the TFT multi-information screen in the instrument binnacle. If the driver exceeds the speed limit, the system will activate a warning light and buzzer. Automatic High Beam helps ensure excellent forward visibility when driving at night. It detects both the headlights of oncoming vehicles, and the tail lights of vehicles ahead, automatically switching between high and low beams to avoid dazzling other drivers. As high beam is used more frequently, pedestrians and obstacles are easier and quicker to spot. With a reduced risk of being involved in a collision, vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety Sense can benefit from lower insurance group ratings, reducing ownership costs. New RAV4 will also continue to offer Toyota’s Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert systems within its safety provisions. Panoramic View Monitor RAV4’s new Panoramic View Monitor uses an array of four cameras located on the underside of each door mirror and on the front and rear of the vehicle to capture a real-time 360-degree bird’s-eye view of its immediate surroundings. The monitor can still be used while the vehicle is parked, before it is put into gear and the parking brake is released, a feature unique to Toyota’s system,. It can present a combine the images from any of the four cameras to provide a composite view and provide guidance lines on the rear view monitor image to show the vehicle’s path to help with parking and low-speed manoeuvres. The wide, 180-degree front and rear view projections allow the driver to check blind spots each side of the vehicle. The side cameras will still operate if the door mirrors are folded, while a panoramic zoom function can be used to home in on nearby objects that would otherwise be difficult to see. 4.2-inch multi-information screen The new-look instrument binnacle in RAV4 gains a 4.2-inch TFT colour multi-information screen. The display is controlled using switchgear on the steering wheel and it can also be co-ordinated with the seven-inch centre console screen. The variety of functions and information that can be accessed includes vehicle settings customisation, trip computer, Smart Stop & Start telemetry, hybrid powertrain energy monitor, turn-by-turn navigation and real-time AWD vehicle posture and steering lock indication. Exterior design The changes to RAV4’s exterior styling are most strongly evident at the front where there is more powerful interpretation of Toyota’s current design language. The Toyota emblem is set prominently within a slender upper grille which anchors new LED or halogen headlamp units, both of which incorporate LED daytime running lights. The middle grille has been made wider, while the lower, trapezoidal grille has been significantly enlarged. The extremities of these two grille sections combine to form deep housings for the fog lights at the furthest edges of the bumper, emphasising RAV4’s wide and stable front track. The front underguard has been restyled to add visual impact and reinforce the vehicle’s rugged qualities. There is new trim for the wheelarches and sills, helping create a cleaner profile, together with new 17 and 18-inch alloy wheel designs. At the rear there are new lamp clusters with LEDs that create a high-tech lighting signature. The rear bumper has been restyled for greater prominence and emphasis on the vehicle’s width and stance, and the rear underguard has a stronger look, too. The new RAV4 will be available (according to market) in nine body colours, including new dark red and blue metallic shades. Interior design Changes to the interior focus on delivering better functionality and a consistent, visual harmony that increases the cabin’s look, feel and touch qualities. The instrument binnacle, centre console and gear shift surround have all been redesigned and the dashboard, door panel and armrest trims have a new look, with premium quality trims adopted throughout. The instrument binnacle now features two analogue dials and a new 4.2-inch multi-information screen. The redesign of the centre console allows for the addition of the new seven-inch touch screen for the Toyota Touch 2 multimedia system.  The door panel and centre armrest trims have been restyled for greater comfort and better tactile quality, and new matt black and neutral silver finishes have been introduced. The sense of visual harmony has been further heightened by using consistent blue back-lighting for the instrumentation and new interior ambient lighting. Additional interior colour schemes will be available, including four high-grade leather upholsteries, including revised beige and grey shades and a new tan leather. related stories.

©2015 PR Newswire. All Rights Reserved.. European carmakers race to catch up as Toyota shows off new Prius. Facing tougher emission standards, European automakers are rushing to roll out hybrid cars, but they face an uphill battle to catch up with Toyota which popularised the technology 18 years ago. 

The electric powered BMW i8 (R) and i3 are seen next to a charging point at the 66th IAA auto show in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany, on September 15, 2015 | © AFP | Odd Andersen 

The Japanese giant will be showing its latest Prius — the fourth edition since 1997 — at the IAA motor show in Frankfurt this week. 

Almost two decades ago, few expected the car with a complex technology combining a petrol engine with battery-powered generators to become a hit. 

In fact, the concept is not new, and Porsche lays claim to the first petrol-electric car prototype built by its founder as early as 1900. 

But it is the Japanese giant that has managed to popularise the technology, first with 17,600 units in 1998, before sales exploded with its more spacious second-generation Prius. 

Today, the car has become a symbol of environmental responsibility and Toyota’s rivals, including Honda, Nissan, General Motors and Ford, have jumped into the game. 

However, Toyota has enjoyed a substantial lead, having already sold more than eight million hybrids. 

The Prius is by far the top-selling new car in Japan, where the hybrid market makes up close to 40 percent of total sales. 

By comparison, hybrids make up just three percent of the US market — and the share is shrinking with dropping petrol prices. 

The hybrid has also remained a largely marginal affair on the other side of the Atlantic. 

But it is slowly “starting to find a market because the cost equation is starting to balance out for some consumers,” said Francois Jaumain from PwC. 

Notably, several European governments offer subsidies or lower tax rates for owners of hybrid or electric vehicles. 

Toyota hopes to double its sales in Europe to 400,000 units by 2020, the Japanese group’s executive vice president Didier Leroy told AFP. 

– German carmakers join race – 

Flavien Neuvy, who heads the Cetelem observatory on automobiles, added that consumers feel more confident about hybrids because, unlike with fully electric vehicles, drivers are less worried about being stranded at the side of the road given the petrol backup. 

He believes that hybrid sales in Europe could rise to 10 percent of total volume. 

Europe’s latest emissions standard — Euro 6 which took effect September 1 — has also made hybrids more attractive as it will increase the cost of running cars powered by polluting diesel fuel. 

In addition, car markets are required to meet the EU target of 95 g\/km of CO2 emissions by 2020, giving them further incentives to find greener solutions. 

According to a study by credit insurer Euler Hermes, Germany is currently trailing with average emissions of 130 g\/km in 2014, dragged down by luxury energy guzzlers, while France has recorded 112 g\/km. 

The German auto industry is therefore pumping “massive investments into hybrid and electric technologies”, the study said. 

That is on full display at the Frankfurt show. 

BMW is showcasing its new rechargeable hybrids, while rival Mercedes-Benz expects to launch 10 models by 2017. 

Volkswagen already has one hybrid version of its best-selling Golf line. 

Audi and Porsche too are in the race. 

Absent for now, however, are the French makers. 

PSA Peugeot Citroen, whose high-end diesel hybrids have so far failed to gain traction commercially, has indicated that it will launch hybrid gas-electric cars by the end of the decade. 

Renault meanwhile is banking on electric cars. 

It has so far not produced any hybrids although its chief executive Carlos Ghosn said he does not rule out the possibility that its recently presented Talisman line would one day be hybrid. 

© 2015 AFP. New Toyota Prius revealed. The Toyota Prius is something of a poster child for hybrid cars and we now know what the fourth-generation model looks like ahead of its official debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show. 
 
Today's official images of the new Toyota Prius are of a car that is sleeker and more aerodynamic than the outgoing model to improve performance, aerodynamics and, of course, visual appeal. The most obvious aesthetic changes are the large swept-back headlights, vertical rear lights that meet a subtle rear spoiler, and blacked out C-pillars that create a 'floating roof' effect.  
 
As well as a more attractive and efficient shape, the new Toyota Prius comes on a new platform that has allowed a redesigned hybrid drive system to be used in the car. That should see fuel economy top 90mpg and CO2 emissions come in at around 70g\/km. Reductions below the existing 100g\/km threshold are increasingly important with new tax bands looming in the next few years . Toyota hasn't released any figures as yet but claims the new Prius 'is set to establish new benchmarks in fuel economy, emissions and efficiency'. 
   
Image 5 of 16 
  
The new platform is called TNGA and will underpin a number of Toyota and Lexus vehicles in future, including the next Yaris and several compact SUVs. As the base for the new Prius, it allows a lower centre of gravity for better handling, as well as the introduction of a four-wheel-drive system. 
 
The four-wheel-drive system on the new Prius is called e-4WD and is powered by the car's 1.8-litre petrol engine, plus one electric motor for the front wheels and another for the rears. The e-4WD system is rumoured to improve the car's performance in tricky driving conditions but only function at speeds up to 37mph. 
   
Image 8 of 16 
  
The introduction of four-wheel drive and a smarter interior featuring a new steering wheel in the new Prius are thought to have influenced Toyota's decision to upgrade the car's batteries to a smaller, more energy-dense type. All this could nudge up the starting price of the car to around £25,000, which would push those on tighter budgets towards the hybrid versions of the Toyota Auris or Toyota Yaris . The new Prius will go on sale in early 2016. 
 
A new version of the Prius Plug-in is on its way in 2016 too. Upgrades to the lithium-ion battery pack combined with better aerodynamics and a more efficient hybrid system will see improvements to the car's electric-only range and its current efficiency figures of 134mpg and 49g\/km.. Vegan Hurst couple presses Tesla to cut leather from car interiors. DETROIT — Tesla Motors shareholders Mark Peters and Elizabeth Farrell Peters had a simple request for the electric-car maker at its annual meeting in June: Stop offering leather interiors and make Tesla the first “cruelty-free” premium brand. 
 
Shareholders rejected the proposal after Tesla’s board said it would delay production. But CEO Elon Musk seemed intrigued by the Hurst couple’s proposal. 
 
“We’ll look into it,” he said. Last month, the Peterses took delivery of a leather-free Tesla Model S, the second one in their garage. 
 
For car buyers like the Peterses — who have been vegans for more than two decades — leather-free choices are limited. The car-buying site Edmunds.com says 78 percent of 2015 model-year vehicles have standard leather seats on at least one trim level. In other words, buyers content with basic models can get cloth seats and plastic steering wheels, but as they add options like better engines, heated seats or upgraded speakers, they usually have to add leather seats. 
 
Edmunds says 79 vehicles in the 2015 model year don’t require buyers to get leather at any trim level. Those include the Toyota Prius hybrid, the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Jetta. But even some models with cloth or faux-leather seats — like the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt — still have leather-wrapped steering wheels. 
 
That’s not likely to change anytime soon. Most customers worldwide equate leather with quality, richness and comfort, says Mel Stephens, a spokesman for automotive seat maker Lear Corp. 
 
“Vinyl is good, but leather is better,” he said. “People like natural materials.” 
 
Luxury automakers, including Audi and Cadillac, say requests for non-leather interiors are rare. Even when they get them, high-volume automakers can’t necessarily stop the assembly line and make a personalized car. 
 
Ford won’t replace leather seats at the factory, for example, but says dealers can install different seats if a customer requests them. 
 
David Peters of DLP Advisors, a leather-industry consulting firm, forecasts continued growth in automotive leather over the next decade as luxury car sales increase worldwide, particularly in China. Automakers used around 2 billion square feet of leather in 2014, or around 45 million cow hides; that was 17 percent of the global supply of hides. By 2025, that could grow to 25 percent, Peters said. 
 
A vehicle interior usually requires two or three hides; some high-end luxury vehicles, like the Rolls-Royce Phantom, use as many as nine. 
 
Environmentalists and animal rights groups say leather tanneries pollute land and water with chemicals like chromium, which the U.S. government classifies as a carcinogen. Raising, processing and transporting livestock also accounts for an estimated 14.5 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2013 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 
Elizabeth Peters, 42, a dental hygienist and yoga instructor, became a vegetarian as a teen — and later a vegan — after growing up on a veal farm. Her husband, an airline pilot, became concerned about the inhumane treatment of animals after a visit to a slaughterhouse when he was 12. Mark Peters, 51, became a vegan in the early 1990s. 
 
“You have to be honest about what you learn and what you know,” he said. “If you put your blinders on, that makes you partially responsible.” 
 
Mark Peters was driving a BMW 3 Series with faux-leather seats when he decided to look at a Tesla Model S because he wanted an electric car. Tesla offers cloth seats on case models, but he was annoyed by the standard leather-wrapped steering wheel and the fact that he couldn’t get options like heated seats without upgrading to leather. He contacted Tesla in 2012; after a little haggling, the company promised him the nonleather options he wanted at no extra cost, including a hand-built, nonleather steering wheel. He got the car in June 2013. 
 
A year later, the couple decided to order another Tesla, but the premium package they wanted, with perks like trunk lights and a power lift gate, required them to get a leather-wrapped dashboard. This time, Tesla wouldn’t budge, so they got a stripped-down, leather-free version, but weren’t happy and traded it in. It wasn’t until after Tesla’s annual meeting in June that the company relented and let them purchase a premium leather-free Model S. 
 
The Peterses remain hopeful that Tesla will switch to completely leather-free interiors, a move that could have ripple effects across the industry.

 At the inaugural session of the 55th SIAM Annual Convention are (from left) Mr. Vinod. K. Dasari, Vice President, SIAM, and MD, Ashok Leyland, Mr. Sumit Mazumdar, CII President, and Chairman and MD, Tractors India Ltd., Mr. Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Toyota Motor Corporation, Dr. R.S. Katoch, Secretary, Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public enterprises, Mr. Vikram Kirloskar, SIAM President, and Vice Chairman, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd., Mr. Ramesh Suri, ACMA President, and Chairman, Subros Ltd. and Mr. Vishnu Mathur, Director General, SIAM 
  
The 55th Annual Convention of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) held in New Delhi on September 2 brought together the biggest names in the Indian auto industry once again, particularly with the presence of Union Ministers that upped the confidence level of the gathering. Themed “Automotive Mission Plan: Make in India”, the Convention had participation by several senior bureaucrats and auto industry stalwarts, including CEOs and senior representatives from the Indian and global manufacturers, who presented their perspectives about the auto industry‘s role in emerging India and the future of mobility in the country. 
 
The session had its fitting finale with a curtain-raiser to the Automotive Mission Plan 2016-2026 (AMP 2026) which spelt out the industry targets to be achieved in the next 10 years. 
 
Addressing the convention, Mr. Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, the Chief Guest on the convention, said the Government has been mulling the option of creating a new department of transport which will be headed by a new Secretary. The new department with technically qualified experts would be set up once PMO approves of it. 
  
 Mr. Nitin Gadkari, Hon’ble Minister of Road Transport and Highways, the Guest of Honour of the occasion, addressing the gathering at the Special Plenary Session. The others are (from left) Mr. Arvind Saxena, President & MD, General Motors India, Mr. Pawan Munjal, Chairman, CEO, and MD, Hero MotoCorp Ltd. and Mr. K. K. Gandhi, Executive Director – Technical, SIAM 
  
The Minister also stressed the importance of infrastructure and road safety, and stated that the Government has already ordered for nine PPP projects, which highlights the steady flow of investments in the road infrastructure. Infrastructure was the first step to improve and increase road network. However Government would also be promoting the waterways and railway network as the primary mode of transport within the country. 
 
In his address, Mr. Amitabh Kant, Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said: “If India has to grow at the rate of 7-8%, then the automotive and auto component industry have to be the key driver of this growth, not only in the case of manufacturing but also innovation and frugal engineering. 
 
He also emphasised the importance of connected cars and shared mobility like services of Ola and Uber which are driven by technology. 
 

 
Welcoming the guests at the inaugural session of the convention, Mr. Vikram Kirloskar, SIAM President, and Vice Chairman, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd., said: “The last three years have been challenging for the Indian automotive industry. However, conditions have improved significantly over the past fiscal.” 
 
He added that the auto industry is a highly taxed sector and is unfairly targeted for being the primary cause of pollution, which the Government needs to look into. The industry is also hopeful that GST will be implemented soon. 
 
Following Mr. Kirloskar’s speech, Mr. Ramesh Suri, President, ACMA and Chairman, Subros Ltd., and Mr. Sumit Mazumder, CII President, and Chairman & MD, TIL Ltd., also addressed the audience. Mr. Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Toyota Motor Corporation, spoke on the hybrid technology and how Toyota Prius was driving the category. 
  
 At the plenary session on ‘To establish Brand India as global platform’ are (from left) Mr. Guillaume Sicard, President, Nissan India Operations, Nissan Motor India Pvt. Ltd., Mr. Rajiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto Ltd., Mr. Ambuj Sharma, Addl. Secretary, Ministry of Heavy Industries, Mr. Ravindra Pisharody, Executive Director, CVBU, Tata Motors Ltd., and Mr. Sugato Sen, Deputy Director-General, SIAM 
  
In his address, Mr. R.S. Katoch, Secretary, Ministry of Heavy industries and Public Enterprises, who was the chief guest on the occasion, said: “We have been trying to support the industry and to devise policies which would help the industry. While there have been high-level concerns on emission norms of late, we have tried to put forth the case of the industry in the best possible way with the Ministry. There are a lot of misconceptions which we believe can be addressed with proper studies on the subject matter.” 
 
The special plenary session was inaugurated by Mr. Pawan Munjal, Chairman, CEO and MD, Hero MotoCorp Ltd. Mr. Arvind Saxena, President and MD, General Motors India, delivered the closing remarks for the session. 
 
In the first technical session of the day, the speakers discussed the future of mobility by 2030. The discussion covered different aspects of mobility, including sustainability and hybrid technology. 
 
Vision 3\/12\/65 
 
The occasion also witnessed the curtain-raiser for the Automotive Mission Plan 2016-2026 (AMP 2026). With its ‘Vision 3\/12\/65’, this is the second edition of the Automotive Mission Plan after the first one in 2006-2016. The AMP 2026 is the collective vision of the Government and the Indian automotive industry, aimed at mapping the progress of the automobile industry in India and setting targets and goals for this sector over the next ten years. It addresses areas of relevance, including growth in terms of size, contribution to India’s development, global environmental footprint, technological maturity, safety, competitiveness, and institutional structure and capabilities. 
  
 From left, Mr. Raghuttama Rao, MD, IMaCS, Mr. Vinod Dasari, Mr. R.S. Katoch, Dr. Pawan Goenka, Past President, SIAM, and Executive Director & Group President-Auto & Farm Sector, M&M, Mr. Ambuj Sharma, and Mr. Vishnu Mathur, jointly presenting the AMP 2026 Curtain Raiser document 
  
The document was unveiled at the final session of the convention, which was chaired by Dr. Pawan Goenka, Past President, SIAM, and Executive Director & Group President – Auto & Farm Sector, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. 
 
Mr R. Raghuttama Rao, Managing Director, ICRA Management Consulting Services (IMaCS) presented the vision to the gathering. Talking about the key achievements of the AMP 2006-2016, he said: “The investments under AMP 2016 exceeded Rs. 1,60,000 crores and the industry is poised to generate more than 35 million jobs by the end of 2016. The industry is on course, as per the AMP 2016, to hit the base-case target of Rs. 5,49,000 crores of revenue by the end of FY16. There is also need for greater institutional co-ordination. 
 
Outlining the vision of AMP 2026, he said: “By 2026 the Indian automotive industry will be among the top three of the world in engineering, manufacture, and export of vehicles and components, and will encompass safe, efficient and environment friendly conditions for affordable mobility of people and transportation of goods in India comparable with global standards, growing in value to over 12% of India’s GDP and generating an additional 65 million jobs.” 
 
A quick decoding of the Vision 3\/12\/65 indicates that the 3 refers to India becoming one among the top three auto markets globally, 12 pointing to a minimum contribution of 12 per cent to the country’s GDP by the auto sector, and 65 indicating the additional 65 million jobs the industry hoeps to create in the country as part of the ten-year plan. 
 
Dr. R.S. Katoch, Secretary, Department of Heavy Industry, Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, said that implementation of GST is a must for the industry and that the scope of growth for the industry would increase manifold if the tax structure is improved. 
 
Implemented in 2006, the first Automotive Mission Plan (AMP 2006-2016) has till date witnessed several progressions of evolution of the Indian automobile industry with many of its objectives being met while others being fulfilled by the end of the stipulated period. 
 
Overall, the SIAM Convention proved a much-needed platform, as it does every year, to discuss the way forward for the country’s auto sector, the potential of which has been talked about time and again and is currently in the process of being tapped in a big way. Hoping that the announcements made by the government would attain fruition, the Indian auto industry would certainly be what it has to be – a game-changer and world leader.

 Author. Toyota Prius 2017. The fourth generation Prius will be larger but more efficient than the previous model when it goes on sale in Japan towards the end of this year, Toyota has confirmed. Toyota Prius1.8 VVTi T3 5dr CVT AutoProfile:6+35Mileage:8k Miles p\/a£199.99Per Month, INC VAT£1379.94 initial paymentView DetailsPersonal Leasing Deal by: The Leden GroupNo actual figures regarding fuel economy or emissions have been disclosed so far but Toyota says the next Prius will set new standards in fuel efficiency after extensive revisions to the entire petrol-electric hybrid powertrain resulting in with more compact components and a smaller, more durable battery. Not counting the plug-in model, the most efficient Prius promises 72.4mpg combined at 89g\/km CO2 (T3). The new Prius will also be the most rewarding to drive too, Toyota says, with a smoother, more responsive acceleration. Again, no numbers on how quick the new Prius will be but we’d expect it to improve on the current 10.4 second 0-62mph sprint. Measuring 4.54 metres long by 1.76 metres wide, the all-new hybrid saloon will be 60mm longer and 15mm wider than the model it replaces. The 2.7 metre wheelbase is unchanged but it will be 20mm narrower at 1470mm. Safety features include Adaptive Cruise Control and a pedestrian detection function for the Pre-Crash Safety system.
Kouji Toyoshima, Chief Engineer on the new Prius, said: “There is much more to the new Prius than a green image. The exterior has a particularly emotional appearance, thanks in part to the new platform that enables a low slung silhouette similar to a sports car.”
Toyota has sold more than 3.5 million Prius models in 80 countries worldwide since the hybrid’s introduction in 1997.  . Vintage Editorial: The Truth About Diesels (2007) – Now Truer Than Ever. ( I was going to write something about the VW Dieselgate, and then realized that I had rather presciently written about it, or what helped cause it to happen, as well as the inevitable after-effects yet to come, back in 2007, at ttac.com . I’ll add a bit more commentary at the end ). 
 
No wonder the Germans are so gung-ho on sending their diesels across the pond. Europe’s two-decade long diesel-keg party has been crashed by a new generation of super-efficient, clean and cheaper gasoline engines. A royal diesel-overproduction hang-over is inevitable. The Germans’ morning-after solution: send the stinky leftovers to enthusiastic Yanks waiting with open arms, who’ve conveniently forgotten their killer hangover from the last US diesel orgy. 
 
In 1892, an experimental ammonia engine literally blew up in engineer Rudolph Diesel’s face. Laid-up in a hospital bed, he pored over Nicolaus Otto’s pioneering work on the internal combustion engine. Diesel identified its weakness. 
 
Diesel tumbled to the fact that the Otto engine’s efficiency was intrinsically compromised by the fact that it mixed fuel with air prior to compression. Too much compression resulted in uncontrolled pre-detonation. Diesel’s solution: inject fuel separately from the air to allow super-high compression and eliminating the need for a throttle (reducing pumping losses). Diesel’s engine was roughly 30% more efficient than Otto’s. 
 
In 1989, VW\/Audi ushered in the modern direct-injection (TDI) diesel. The group’s oil burning powerplant set a high-water mark in the diesel’s long development. With Europe’s high fuel costs, the more expensive (yet efficient) diesel engine could now pay for itself quite easily. The calculation triggered Europe’s diesel-boom, resulting in a 50 percent market share vs. gasoline-engined propulsion. 
 
But Europeans have been paying a price (other than at the pumps): particulate emissions (Particulate Matter, or “PM”) and NOx pollution. Many European cities have serious particulate and diesel odor problems. Several European cities impose restrictions on diesels during PM alerts. 
 
The new generation of “clean(er)” diesels that meet the US Tier2 bin5 standards cut PM emissions substantially, but not completely. Already, there are warnings that PM from “clean” diesels still poses a significant health risk. 
 
The diesels coming our way carry several other penalties, especially versus the gas hybrid. The complicated and expensive NOx catalysts and urea injection schemes (“BlueTec”) cut efficiency by five percent. Meanwhile, the next Prius is projected to be 15 to 20 percent more efficient. And Toyota is bringing down hybrid production costs. 
 
The diesel vs. hybrid mileage\/cost gap widens… further. And the “clean” diesel’s just-barely compliant emissions still can’t touch the gas-hybrid’s practically breathable exhaust. 
 
Then there’s the elephant in the room: global warming. Clearly, the political winds are blowing against CO2. Diesel fuel has higher carbon content, resulting in 17 percent more CO2 per gallon of fuel burned than gasoline. With the diesel’s efficiency superiority down to 25 percent, a “clean” diesel emits only 13 percent less CO2 than yesterday’s gas engine. And that small gap is… wait… gone. 
 
While the diesel’s efficiency peaked in 1989, and lost 5 percent to PM cleansing, gas engine development is on a roll. Engineers are systematically tackling all the inherent deficiencies that Diesel identified in his hospital bed. (No wonder Rudolf was considered paranoid; maybe he suspected that eventually the Otto engine would catch up.) 
 
A number of new gas-engine technologies has converged, which Europeans have been quick to embrace. VW’s 1.4-liter 170hp TSI gas engine is a perfect example of the trend. The TSI starts off with the help of a supercharger (no turbo-lag), and then switches to turbocharging (no parasitic losses). With diesel-like torque and direct injection, it’s the best of both worlds. 
 
A CO2 output comparison with two other similar-output VW engines is telling. Their 170 horse 1.4-liter TSI produces 174g\/kms of CO2. Their 150hp 2.5-liter five cylinder engine (US Rabbit only) emits 240g\/km. And their 170hp 2.0-liter TDI diesel (not US compliant) produces 160g\/km. 
 
American Rabbit drivers are paying a whopping 38 percent efficiency penalty compared to the Euro-Golf TSI, as well as giving up gobs of torque and twenty horsepower. If VW’s 170hp TDI were “cleansed” to T2b5 standards, its CO2 output would be no better then the gasoline TSI. 
 
And that’s just the jumping-off point. Start-stop technology, full valve control, and stratified direct-injection offer anywhere from 10 to 25 percent further improvement potential. Combine these goodies with mild-hybrid assist\/regeneration, and the diesel party’s kaput. No wonder the Germans are all hard at work on mild-hybrid technology. It’s their best shot to keep up with Toyota’s CO2 meister, the Prius (102g\/km). 
 
A study by the consulting firm AT Kearny confirms the diesel’s demise. It predicts that only 25 percent of Europeans will find diesels an attractive economic proposition by 2020. 
 
Have Rudolf Diesel’s paranoid nightmares come true? Not totally. Diesels are a welcome mix to the party for larger vehicles that spend a lot of time on the open road. Count on GM’s new 4.5-liter “baby” Duramax diesel to be more popular with the light-truck crowd than the gas hybrid option. But when it comes to smaller vehicles, the numbers just don’t add up. 
 
Although Rudolf Diesel’s engine WAS intrinsically more efficient, it turns out that Otto’s engine is a lot more clever at learning new tricks. 
 
  
 

 
( Update 9\/22\/2015 )   That article unleashed quite a reaction at the time, as the second American diesel love-affair was just really getting under way in the US. I was branded a “diesel hater” and “hybrid lover”, a rep that I’ve had a hard time shaking, since I have been a diesel skeptic for a long time. Ironically, I’ve somewhat softened my stance in the past few years, in part because the “Clean Diesels” from VW really did seem to be a surprisingly workable solution to the very stringent new US and EU emission standards. Well, that delusional party’s over. 
 
My skepticism has primarily hinged on the following long-term view: that hybridization (with super-efficient gas Atkinson-cycle engines ) offers better overall efficiency, is much cleaner, has lower CO output (because diesel has a higher CO content per gallon), and is the right technology to segue into the inevitable electrification of the automobile. I’m not saying all cars will be hybrid or electric by any given particular time frame, but the intrinsic efficiency and potential CO benefits of EVs does mean that as battery technology inevitable improves over time, their market share will also inevitable increase. It may take a while. Meanwhile, VW is drastically stepping up its future hybrid\/EV product plans. 
 

 
In the meantime, hybridization and ever-more efficient gas engines, which are much easier and cheaper to “clean”, have already put a crimp in the diesel’s advantage. Europe, which subsidized diesels by lowering the tax on it, created a huge diesel boom that many countries were already starting to regret. There has been a growing anti-diesel movement afoot in Europe, especially in big cities, because of emissions concerns. Some cities are proposing bans on diesels. 
 
This huge VW crisis will only speed that inevitable process up. VW’s cheating was even more rampant in Europe than in the US, and this will fuel a more rapid move away from diesels, most likely by removing the tax advantages of diesel fuel, and possibly more draconian measures. 
 
Will diesels disappear soon? Of course not. They can make a lot of sense, especially in larger vehicles: SUVs, light trucks and large trucks, although in the US, even that is in question. UPS is switching its massive fleet of delivery vehicles to gas engines, as they are simply more cost effective in the long term (lower initial cost, lower maintenance). 
 
And refineries in the US and Europe are designed to produce a certain ratio of gasoline to diesel, which optimizes the refinery process. Any significant change in those ratios would require massive investments. 
 
But there’s no question that this current crisis created by VW will have a very significant impact on the diesel’s market share, image and reputation. Americans in particular, who are typically more nimble in their buying habits\/fads, have shown themselves to be willing to abandon diesels before, after the Olds V8 diesel fiasco, and will almost certainly now do so again. 
 
But Europe will not be spared this shift either. It will take time, but the diesel’s best days are done and over. This is just the coffin nail on what I predicted to happen eight years ago. Ironically, the very company that popularized the modern direct injection diesel engine is the one wielding the hammer.. Toyota updates Prado. Toyota has updated its Prado SUV , introducing a new engine and extra technology to the model as part of its second update in less than two years. 

The big news is under the bonnet, where the 3.0-litre, four-cylinder engine from the previous generation has made way for a 2.8-litre unit that uses less fuel to produce more power and torque than its predecessor. 

The new motor is mated to a six-speed manual or new six-speed automatic transmission that Toyota says is more perceptive to driver needs, ensuring that the car is always in the right gear. 
The revised Toyota Prado features a new diesel engine and extra tech.  Photo: Supplied  
Set to serve under the bonnet of the next-generation HiLux ute and new Fortuner SUV , the motor produces 130kW of power at 3400rpm and either 420Nm or 450Nm of torque depending on whether the car is fitted with a manual or automatic transmission, figures that build neatly on the 127kW and 410Nm outputs of the outgoing car. 

The Prado differs from lesser models in that it uses a counter-balancing shaft to reduce engine vibrations, while new chain driven timing gear also adds to its efficiency – reducing service intervals too. 

The new diesel's 7.9L\/100km combined urban and highway efficiency is significantly better than the old car's 8.8L\/100km, helped by cylinder heads that burn fuel more efficiently than before. 
The Prado remains one of the most capable cars off-road.  Photo: Supplied  
The Prado's 150 litre fuel capacity and 7.0L\/100km highway economy give it a maximum range of more than 2000 kilometres, a factor that has been key to its domination of the rural SUV market. 

The diesel motor is now fitted with a diesel particulate filter that cuts down emissions, bringing the diesel machine into line with Euro 5 emissions standards matched by its petrol sibling. 

Toyota's 4.0-litre petrol V6 now makes 207kW – up from 202kW – but its 381Nm torque peak remains unchanged. The petrol model's fuel economy has increased by 0.1L\/100km to 11.6L\/100km, though its emissions have dropped slightly. The manufacturer says it focused on the diesel version as more than 98 per cent of Prado consumers choose to avoid petrol power and go for the more efficient option. 
 
The car costs $390 to $1500 more than before.  

Priced from $52,990 plus on-road costs, the entry-level Prado GX is the only model in the range fitted with five seats as standard. All others feature seven seats, a feature that fetches an additional $2500 option in the GX. 

That model has a rear-view camera and audio touchscreen as standard, along with air conditioning, cruise control, Bluetooth, alloy wheels and more. 
Top-grade Prado models feature clever locally-developed KDSS suspension.  Photo: Supplied  
Available only with the diesel engine and a choice of a manual or automatic new six-speed automatic transmission, the GX doesn't offer quite as much choice as the next rung on Toyota's ladder. 

The GXL is Toyota's best-seller, capturing around three quarters of the model's sales so far this year. That's because it offers buyers a choice of petrol or diesel power, and manual or automatic transmissions, along with seven seats as standard. 

Available from $59,990 in diesel manual form, the GXL now includes satellite navigation, along with a jump from six to nine speakers in the stereo and additional infotainment apps including Pandora music streaming.

The GXL also adds three-zone climate control, rear parking sensors, front fog lamps, an alarm system, and luxuries such as roof rails, side steps and premium covers for the steering wheel, hand brake and shift lever. 

Prado VX customers can have a petrol or diesel engine with an automatic engine for $72,990 or $73,990 respectively in a pack that adds 18-inch alloy wheels, Toyota's clever Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System with active anti-roll bars, LED headlamps, leather trim, a 17-speaker JBL stereo, front parking sensors and more. 

The top-whack Prado Kakadu costs $390 more than before at $83,490 plus on-road costs in petrol form, adding a new rear cross traffic alert system into an environment that includes radar cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, a blind spot monitor, Blu-ray rear entertainment, 360-four-way external cameras, a sunroof and height-adjustable rear air suspension in a laundry list of luxury extras. 

As before, the Prado range has a 2500 kilogram maximum towing capacity.

Facing tougher emission standards, European automakers are rushing to roll out hybrid cars, but they face an uphill battle to catch up with Toyota which popularised the technology 18 years ago.

The Japanese giant will be showing its latest Prius — the fourth edition since 1997 — at the IAA motor show in Frankfurt this week. 

Almost two decades ago, few expected the car with a complex technology combining a petrol engine with battery-powered generators to become a hit. 

In fact, the concept is not new, and Porsche lays claim to the first petrol-electric car prototype built by its founder as early as 1900. 

But it is the Japanese giant that has managed to popularise the technology, first with 17,600 units in 1998, before sales exploded with its more spacious second-generation Prius. 

Today, the car has become a symbol of environmental responsibility and Toyota’s rivals, including Honda, Nissan, General Motors and Ford, have jumped into the game. 

However, Toyota has enjoyed a substantial lead, having already sold more than eight million hybrids. 

The Prius is by far the top-selling new car in Japan, where the hybrid market makes up close to 40 percent of total sales. 

By comparison, hybrids make up just three percent of the US market — and the share is shrinking with dropping petrol prices. 

The hybrid has also remained a largely marginal affair on the other side of the Atlantic. 

But it is slowly “starting to find a market because the cost equation is starting to balance out for some consumers,” said Francois Jaumain from PwC. 

Notably, several European governments offer subsidies or lower tax rates for owners of hybrid or electric vehicles. 

Toyota hopes to double its sales in Europe to 400,000 units by 2020, the Japanese group’s executive vice president Didier Leroy told AFP. 

– German carmakers join race – 

Flavien Neuvy, who heads the Cetelem observatory on automobiles, added that consumers feel more confident about hybrids because, unlike with fully electric vehicles, drivers are less worried about being stranded at the side of the road given the petrol backup. 

He believes that hybrid sales in Europe could rise to 10 percent of total volume. 

Europe’s latest emissions standard — Euro 6 which took effect September 1 — has also made hybrids more attractive as it will increase the cost of running cars powered by polluting diesel fuel. 

In addition, car markets are required to meet the EU target of 95 g\/km of CO2 emissions by 2020, giving them further incentives to find greener solutions. 

According to a study by credit insurer Euler Hermes, Germany is currently trailing with average emissions of 130 g\/km in 2014, dragged down by luxury energy guzzlers, while France has recorded 112 g\/km. 

The German auto industry is therefore pumping “massive investments into hybrid and electric technologies”, the study said. 

That is on full display at the Frankfurt show. 

BMW is showcasing its new rechargeable hybrids, while rival Mercedes-Benz expects to launch 10 models by 2017. 

Volkswagen already has one hybrid version of its best-selling Golf line. 

Audi and Porsche too are in the race. 

Absent for now, however, are the French makers. 

PSA Peugeot Citroen, whose high-end diesel hybrids have so far failed to gain traction commercially, has indicated that it will launch hybrid gas-electric cars by the end of the decade. 

Renault meanwhile is banking on electric cars. 

It has so far not produced any hybrids although its chief executive Carlos Ghosn said he does not rule out the possibility that its recently presented Talisman line would one day be hybrid.

Southfield, Michigan, September 29, 2015.Matt Puccia, crew chief for the No. 16 Kleen Performance Products Ford Fusion, rolled the dice by keeping his driver, Greg Biffle, on the track while other teams were opting for fuel and new tires in the final 85 laps of Sunday's Sylvania 300 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Loudon, N.H. The gamble paid off as the 16 car had just enough fuel to coast over the finish line in fourth place. Following the race, Puccia received the prestigious ""Problem Solver of the Race"" crew chief award from MOOG ® , the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap.

The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
    
Biffle was running 15 th with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the final green-flag segments to finish in the top five. 
 
""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn't have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts.

HUG#1955450. Toyota Launches Hydrogen-Fueled Sedan. Toyota is taking the next step in its quest for carbon-free travel with the launch of the Mirai hydrogen-fueled sedan. 
 
The Japanese brand that pioneered the hybrid gas-electric powertrain sees hydrogen cars as the end-game, following plug-in hybrids and full-electric vehicles. 
 
The region's new CEO, Johan van Zyl, told reporters on the sidelines of the Frankfurt auto show on Monday that ""It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,"" hydrogen technology will go mainstream. 
 
Toyota Europe expects sales of between 50 and 100 Mirai's this year and next, with 47 ordered to date. It is being sold only in Britain, Germany, Denmark and Belgium, where Toyota is working on getting in hydrogen pumping stations with local partners. 
 
Toyota Europe sales chief Karl Schlicht said that current customers include governments and companies looking to reduce their carbon emissions. He expects the technology to be affordable for average consumers by 2025. 
 
Toyota Europe last year sold 880,000 cars, up 3 percent from a year earlier. Twenty percent of those were hybrids. Schlicht forecasts sales will be down 1-2 percent this year due to the economic slowdown in Russia. 
 
Van Zyl expects hybrid sales to grow with the launch at Frankfurt show of the new RAV4 small SUV, which for the first time will be offered also with a hybrid powertrain, joining the Yaris, Auris and restyled Prius..

HUG#1955450. Government approves nine PPP projects for road sector. Published Date : Wednesday, September 2nd, 2015  Time posted: 10:07 pm      By - 
 
New Delhi, Sep 2 (IANS) The government on Wednesday said it has already approved nine public private partnership (PPP) projects to increase investments in road infrastructure. 
 
Information on the new PPP projects was announced by union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari while addressing the 55th SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) annual convention being held here. 
 
“Infrastructure is the first step to improve and increase road network,” Gadkari said. 
 
The minister further announced that the government is planning to create a new “department of transport.” 
 
Gadkari elaborated that the new department will be headed by a secretary level official. 
 
“The new department will have experts which will be abreast with the technical knowledge so that technical regulations can be designed better. This body will come into existence once the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office) approves it,” Gadkari said. 
 
Other key government officials also participated in the event. 
 
The Commerce and Industry Ministry’s Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) Secretary Amitabh Kant said that auto industry would be a key growth driver for the country. 
 
“If India has to grow at the rate of 7-8 percent, then the automotive and auto component industry have to be the key driver of this growth, not only in case of manufacturing but also innovation and frugal engineering,” Kant said. 
 
Kant also stressed upon the importance of connected cars and shared mobility, like services of Ola, Uber which are driven by technology. 
 
Heavy industries and Public Enterprises’ Secretary R.S Katoch said that while there have been high level concerns on emission norms of late, we have tried to put forth the case of the industry in the best possible way. 
 
“There are a lot of misconceptions which we believe can be addressed with proper studies on the subject matter,” Katoch said. 
 
SIAM President Vikram Kirloskar, who is also the vice chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motor said that the last three years have been challenging for Indian automotive industry. 
 
“However, the conditions have improved significantly over the past fiscal.” 
 
He added that the industry is hopeful that GST (goods and services tax) will soon be implemented. 
 Related Posts. Toyota hybrid sales reach 8 million (Fuseworks). Toyota’s Hybrid technology has chalked up its eighth million sale world wide as the technology becomes increasingly widely accepted. 

The Prius, which led the launch of petrol-electric vehicles with its launch in Japan in 1997, has now expanded to 30 Toyota and Lexus vehicles incorporating Hybrid technology. 

In New Zealand the Prius, Prius c, Prius v and Camry have Hybrid technology as well as the Lexus CT, IS, ES, GS, NX and RX models. 

Toyota started exporting Hybrid vehicles to Europe and North America in 2000, while New Zealand’s first Prius arrived here in 2001. 

The take-up of Hybrid technology has accelerated with more focus on fuel saving and lower emission regulations worldwide and the introduction of more models to meet market demand. 

The one millionth Hybrid was sold in 2007, 10 years after the launch of the first Prius. While 2009 saw sales double to two million and the three million mark was reached in February 2011, with unit four million coming in April 2012. 

Now Toyota is adding another million Hybrid sales in less than 12 months. The fifth and sixth million were sold in March and December 2013.The seven million mark was reached in September last year and the eighth million in July. 

Eight million Hybrid vehicles have had a considerable positive impact on the environment. Toyota has calculated that at the end of July, its Hybrid vehicles have emitted 58 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions than would have been generated by pure petrol engined vehicles of a similar size and driving performance. 

Toyota also estimated these eight million Hybrids have saved about 22 million kilolitres of petrol compared to the amount used by petrol only powered cars of a similar size. 

Perhaps not surprisingly, since it led the way, the Prius is the most successful single model with more than 3.5 million sales, followed by the Prius c with just over one million, while the Prius v and Camry Hybrid have both recorded more than 500,000 sales. Toyota New Zealand’s Camry and Camry Hybrid models are sourced from Altona, Australia, which started Camry Hybrid production in 2009. 

The largest selling Lexus Hybrid worldwide is the RX sport’s utility vehicle with over 317,000 while the CT200 has reached nearly quarter of a million. 

Globally, Toyota is expanding its Hybrid range all the time with more SUVs and even light commercial vehicles being added to the Hybrid model mix. 

Hybrid technology encompasses all of the components necessary for the development of environment friendly vehicles and facilitates the use of different fuel combinations. 

Non hybrid vehicles are also benefitting from Toyota’s continuous focus on advancing these technologies.. Gas is cheap, but Toyota still betting on hydrogen. With the average price for a gallon of gasoline falling below $2.50, it may seem like a strange time to introduce a vehicle powered by hydrogen. 

But for Craig Scott, one of the executives leading the development of Toyota (Tokyo Stock Exchange: 7203.T-JP) 's all-new Mirai, launching a fuel-efficient car during a period of low energy prices is nothing new. 

More than a decade ago, Scott served on the team that launched the gas-electric hybrid Prius, which later went on to become the best-selling hybrid. Now, despite gasoline once again being cheap, Scott remains confident that the environmentally friendly Mirai will get plenty of interest. 

""When we launched Prius [in the U.S.] back in 2001, gas was about $1 a gallon, which was pretty tough for a car that is fuel efficient,"" he said. ""The same thing is true for Mirai. In California, gas is $3.50 a gallon which makes it tough, but these things are cyclical."" 

The Mirai is the auto industry's latest push to make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles more than just a concept. The car can go 312 miles on a full tank of hydrogen, and looks and drives like most other new sedans. In other words, it's smooth, comfortable, and-most important to early adopters-clean-burning. The only emission is water vapor. 

California, known for its strict vehicle emission requirements, will be the first state to roll out the Mirai next month. The Golden State is home to 10 of the 12 public hydrogen refueling stations in America, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 

Although other refueling stations are in the works, this lack of infrastructure has been a source of frustration for some of those already driving a hydrogen-powered car and a point of criticism for skeptics. 

""If I didn't live close to the stations I wouldn't be a happy person,"" said Paul Berkman, from Corona del Mar, California. Berkman owns a hydrogen-powered Hyundai Tuscon SUV. 

""That's the only reason I chose this [car],"" he said. ""I have three alternatives within a two- to three-mile radius. If there was only one I might maybe think twice about it."" 

Another issue with hydrogen-powered cars is that the current refueling stations take a long time to fill up a vehicle. 

""I was surprised,"" Berkman said. ""It's not a three-minute fill, it's about a half hour."" 

Skeptics have long had doubted whether hydrogen-powered vehicles will ever catch on. This year, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk called the idea of them silly. 

""It is just very difficult to make hydrogen, store it and use it in a car,"" he said. 

Still, Toyota remains confident that the Mirai, which will start at about $58,000, will eventually gain traction in California. To sweeten the deal, the automaker will pay for three years' worth of hydrogen fuel. 

Toyota said it has already heard from about 1,000 people interested in receiving more information about the hydrogen-powered car, and said it expects to sell 3,000 over the next three years. That compares to more than 41,000 Prius models being sold in the U.S. in its first three years. 

""It's the opportunity to drive a zero-emission vehicle without compromise,"" Scott said. ""That's what's drawing people to it.""

Personal Finance. Not just Volkswagen: A list of past auto industry scandals. With Volkswagen's admission that 11 million of its diesel vehicles worldwide contain software that can rig emissions tests, the German automaker joins a list of auto industry scandals that spans several decades. Among them, Ford Pintos that burst into flames, Toyota vehicles that take off unintentionally and air bags that explode, showering a car's interior with shrapnel.

FORD PINTO

At least 27 people died during the 1970s due to the faulty position of fuel tanks in the Ford Pinto. In some cases, the fuel tank burst into flames following a rear-end collision. Ford recalled more than 1.5 million Pintos in 1978.

FIRESTONE TIRES

About 6.5 million Firestone tires were recalled in 2000 because the tires could shred, blow out or fail. Most of the tires were used in Ford SUVs and light pickup trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in 2001 that it received 271 reports of deaths and 800 injuries related to the faulty tires.

TOYOTA

Toyota agreed to pay $1.2 billion in a settlement last year, admitting that it hid information about defects that caused Toyota and Lexus vehicles to accelerate unexpectedly. Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles, starting in 2009, for several issues, including faulty brakes, sticky gas pedals and problematic floor mats.

GENERAL MOTORS

The automaker's faulty ignition switches have been linked to at least 169 deaths. The switch could slip out of the run position and turn the engine off while driving. Last week, GM agreed to pay $900 million to settle a criminal investigation over the ignition issue. GM has admitted that some employees knew about the problem for nearly a decade, yet cars equipped with the switch were not recalled until last year.

TAKATA AIR BAGS

According to the latest figures from federal regulators, approximately 23.4 million driver and passenger Takata air bags made by on 19.2 million vehicles are being recalled and need to be replaced. The air bags can inflate too quickly and explode, sending metal shrapnel into drivers and passengers. The air bags, which were used in several vehicles, are blamed for causing seven deaths in the U.S.

HUG#1955450. The coming fuel cell revolution: What you need to know. Share This article  
Conversations about fuel cells  tend to sway perilously between groundless optimism and exceptional despair. To grasp this visually, one need look no farther than the historical stock chart of FuelCell Energy Inc., the largest player in the fuel cell industry. Three times in the last four years, the company’s stock has doubled in a number of days, before crashing down to new lows. While public sentiment regarding fuel cells seems to be trending pessimistic , three technological forces have been quietly percolating in the background, creating a kind of perfect storm that could propel fuel cell technology from obscurity into widespread adoption. 

The first and perhaps most surprising of these forces is the plateauing of battery efficiencies. While hardly a day goes by in which some new academic publication promises to have solved the world’s battery crises, these innovations have been tantalizingly slow in making their way to market. The net effect is that we are still plugging away with the same lithium ion battery tech that has been around for decades. And because of the ever-increasing demand for a solution to the power storage dilemma, many companies have opted to look outside the battery box, and often as not, their eyes have come to rest on fuel cells. Two recent news bulletins suggest the smart money is shifting away from the pursuit of better batteries to the adoption of fuel cells. 

Apple Inc. recently made waves by issuing a patent for a fuel-cell-based system that would be capable of powering a MacBook for several weeks without recharge. The patent uses specifications already existing in Apple’s MagSafe charger, suggesting the fuel cell could be used with iPhones and iPads as well. While fuel cells typically work by mixing a fuel such as hydrogen, with an oxidizing agent such as water or oxygen, the Apple patent also lists borohydride, sodium silicate, lithium hydride, magnesium hydride, and other compounds as fuel sources. Apple’s patent comes on the heels of a British company announcing that they had developed a built-in hydrogen fuel cell capable of powering an iPhone for an entire week. 

The other company to reveal plans for abandoning the battery in favor of fuel cells is the world’s largest car maker, Toyota. This is all the more surprising given Toyota’s pioneering success with battery-powered vehicles like the Prius. After several years of exhaustive research, the car giant seems to have concluded that battery powered vehicles will ultimately be labeled a historical dead end and have set their sights on vehicles powered by fuel cells. The reasoning behind Toyota’s startling reversal regarding batteries is worth careful scrutiny (especially if you’re in the market for a Tesla or other electric vehicle). 

The insurmountable problem with battery powered vehicles as Toyota sees it is the issue of the time it takes to recharge. Even with Tesla’s much hyped “superchargers,” the time it takes to recharge an electric vehicle is nowhere near in the vicinity of what it takes to gas up a normal car. Toyota did the math and concluded that drivers won’t be satisfied waiting around 40 minutes for their electric vehicle to recharge. With the current technology, faster charging introduces massive inefficiencies that obviate the technological advantages of an electric vehicle. 

Sensing a dead end, Toyota has bet their war chest on a new fuel cell powered vehicle called the Mirai . Unlike the Tesla, the Mirai can be fully refueled in as little as five minutes, bringing it in line with the amount of time consumers are accustomed to spending at the pump. 

Media personnel swarming the fuel cell powered Mirai. 

Belying those that believe the Mirai might be some kind of one off that’s quickly abandoned, reports have surfaced that Lexus will also launch a fuel-cell-powered LS Sedan in the coming year. Mark Templin, executive vice president of Lexus International, has spoken bullishly about the advantages of fuel cells over other electric vehicles, citing design inefficiencies intrinsic to plugin hybrids. “Unfortunately, when you build a plug-in hybrid you add weight to the vehicle, and you make it less fuel-efficient,” said Templin in an interview with Green Car Reports. While he wouldn’t go on record regarding the potential for a Lexus-made fuel cell sedan, he intimated that this would be his drivetrain of choice in the future. 

Besides from plateauing battery efficiencies, the second force agitating in favor of fuel cells is stricter pollution laws — specifically recent legislation requiring coal power plants to adopt more stringent emission standards. While coal power plants and fuel cells may seem like unlikely bedfellows, this is exactly what seems to be on the cards, thanks to a joint project being undertaken by the United States Department of Energy and FuelCell Energy Inc. Together they are developing an innovative carbon capture technology which will sequester CO2 and nitrogen dioxide from coal burning power plants and use it to power an attached 2-megawatt fuel cell. The model they are currently working with is designed to capture about 60 tons of CO2 per day. 

While the concept of using fuel cells to capture carbon emissions has been around since the 1990s, only in the last decade has the cost of the enabling technology declined enough to make it a viable commercial solution. The higher costs owe in large part to the unique nature of the fuel cells in question, which are called molten carbonate fuel cells and rely on CO2 to operate. This is obviously a more complicated and expensive type of fuel cell than you might find powering your MacBook someday soon. 

The third technological shift creating a rising tide for fuel cells is the invention of novel means for affordably creating their component fuels. While the beauty of fuel cells has always been their efficiency and lack of emissions, they have one major drawback – the gases that power them are expensive to supply, and often require inputs from more traditional power sources like natural gas. Hydrogen for instance, the principle component used to power most fuel cells, is contained in water. But in order to separate it from oxygen in a process called electrolysis, more traditional energy sources are often used, thus canceling out much of environmental and efficiency benefits to be gained from a fuel cell. 

Graphic showing the new material researches at Rice University have created for generating hydrogen using sunlight. 

Recently, however, there have been some promising developments in the creation of new mechanisms for generating hydrogen for fuel cells without resorting to natural gas. For instance, researchers at Rice University in Houston, Texas have devised a relatively simple, low cost way to separate hydrogen from oxygen using sunlight. At the heart of their innovation is a three-layer material made of aluminum, nickel oxide, and gold. Sunlight striking the material gets converted by the gold nanoparticles into high energy “hot” electrons. These “hot electrons” are sequestered on the top layer of the material and used to generate a photocurrent sufficient for splitting water, and siphoning off the resulting hydrogen gas. This hydrogen can then be used to power fuel cells. 

If the above system proves commercially viable and able to scale, it could be a game changer for fuel cells, propelling them from a niche industry into the world’s most sensible power source.

The Telegraph called it “the car industry’s Libor moment.” And indeed, after the massive recalls by GM, Toyota, and others, it’s tempting to see the scandal that’s engulfed Volkswagen—which admitted to fixing diesel vehicles in the US to cheat emissions tests—as a symptom of an industrywide malaise, just like the rate-rigging scandal that touchedalmost every major bank in 2012.

But not so fast. As the New York Times reports, VW’s particular brand of corporate governance was feudal and insular (paywall). “A breeding ground for scandal,” said one observer; “a soap opera ever since it started,” said another.

So rather than a symbol of generalized corruption, maybe VW is just an exceptionally rotten egg—rather like BP, whose “culture of complacency,” much worse than the oil-industry norm, spawned a series of accidents culminating in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster?

It’s a little early to be sure either way. An environmental watchdog in Europe claims the rot is widespread—that other car companies might be using similar tricks to VW’s to pass emissions tests there. However, even if they are, it’s not clear they’d be breaking laws. Rather, these might be clever but legal attempts to game badly designed tests—an indication, perhaps, that it’s Europe’s regulators who need to shape up.

At any rate, VW needs to rebuild its shredded reputation. Quartz’s Steve LeVine argued this week that perhaps the smartest thing it could do is move aggressively into building electric cars. Competing with Apple and Tesla holds the prospect of a halo effect. And who better than VW’s new CEO, the ex-head of Porsche, to take on the flashy, sports-car-loving Elon Musk?

But it won’t be enough for VW just to go big in the clean-car business. It has a culture to clean up, too.—Gideon Lichfield


QUARTZ ANNOUNCEMENT

The way we find, read, and share the news has been transformed by the digital era. Join Quartz and General Assembly, with special speaker Aron Pilhofer, Executive Editor of Digital at The Guardian, for a free event in London on 28 September as we discuss digital-news disruption. Register now.

Five things on Quartz we especially liked

Living with the memories of Everest’s deadliest day. The earthquake that devastated Nepal last April also unleashed an avalanche that killed 21 people at Everest Base Camp. Svati Kirsten Narula was there, and her harrowing first-person account of the avalanche and its aftermath is also a reflection on how traumas that we think we’ve dealt with can come back to haunt us much later.

The internet we’ve always wanted. It’s authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date—yet its costs are minimal, and it’s free to use. Nikhil Sonnad analyzes how the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has managed to create a reliable online resource of the kind that Wikipedia and other crowdsourced sites can only dream of, and how others could emulate it.

This man will fix your pollen allergy with data. A Danish software programmer built systems to monitor every one of his sneezes. For five years. As well as his weight, exercise, food intake… Akshat Rathi on how Thomas Christiansen’s obsessive self-quantifying not only essentially cured him, but offers hope for other sufferers.

The hidden meaning of the pope’s ugly chair. The cheap, crude, even tacky throne built for the pontiff to celebrate mass in New York drew widespread derision. Anne Quito delves into its construction and the provenance of its materials to unearth some very deliberate, and highly papal, messages about humility and inclusiveness.

Quartz turns three. This week in 2012, we were a small and very sleepless group of people who had just launched a website and were trying to work out what next. Kevin Delaney, Quartz’s editor-in-chief, tracks the remarkable changes we’ve undergone since then—thanks to you, our readers.

Five things elsewhere that made us smarter

The most dangerous man in Russia? “Vulgar, venal, vicious, venerated and very rich: somewhere between Uday Hussein and the Notorious B.I.G.” Oliver Bullough has a memorable profile in the Guardian of Ramzan Kadyrov, the warlord-president of Chechnya, and a bold thesis: What if he isn’t a barely controlled loose cannon, butRussian president Vladimir Putin’s plausibly deniable murder weapon?

The killing of an American terrorist. The chilling tale of the 2011 drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, al-Qaeda’s most influential online recruiter, also reveals the inner workings of the Obama administration’s preferred method of killing those deemed America’s enemies. T. Mark McCurley was the mission commander; in a book excerpt for Time, he recounts the story.

The real reason Facebook wants your data. The company’s researchers are using the stream of consciousnesses of its 1.5 billion users to build the world’s first truly artificial intelligent system—one that could one day learn and chat with you like a personal assistant. As Popular Science’s Dave Gershgorn found out, it’s a long, slow slog with few eureka moments.

How the internet became stifling and stalkerish. Self-described “computer guy” Maciej Ceglowski discusses how an arms race between advertising click-fraud bots and online firms has made online surveillance ubiquitous. But he saves his harshest broadsides for the state of affairs in Silicon Valley, where investing “has become the genteel occupation of our gentry,” much like landowning was in times gone by.

What the British are really laughing about with Pig-gate. Lawrence Richards explains in the Leveller what the shocking university initiation ritual involving UK prime minister David Cameron says about the country’s elites. “This forms one of the core mechanics of the British ruling class,” he writes. “Why reveal someone’s dirty little secret when you can keep schtum about it and control them?”

Vintage Editorial: The Truth About Diesels (2007) – Now Truer Than Ever. ( I was going to write something about the VW Dieselgate, and then realized that I had rather presciently written about it, or what helped cause it to happen, as well as the inevitable after-effects yet to come, back in 2007, at ttac.com . I’ll add a bit more commentary at the end ). 
 
No wonder the Germans are so gung-ho on sending their diesels across the pond. Europe’s two-decade long diesel-keg party has been crashed by a new generation of super-efficient, clean and cheaper gasoline engines. A royal diesel-overproduction hang-over is inevitable. The Germans’ morning-after solution: send the stinky leftovers to enthusiastic Yanks waiting with open arms, who’ve conveniently forgotten their killer hangover from the last US diesel orgy. 
 
In 1892, an experimental ammonia engine literally blew up in engineer Rudolph Diesel’s face. Laid-up in a hospital bed, he pored over Nicolaus Otto’s pioneering work on the internal combustion engine. Diesel identified its weakness. 
 
Diesel tumbled to the fact that the Otto engine’s efficiency was intrinsically compromised by the fact that it mixed fuel with air prior to compression. Too much compression resulted in uncontrolled pre-detonation. Diesel’s solution: inject fuel separately from the air to allow super-high compression and eliminating the need for a throttle (reducing pumping losses). Diesel’s engine was roughly 30% more efficient than Otto’s. 
 
In 1989, VW\/Audi ushered in the modern direct-injection (TDI) diesel. The group’s oil burning powerplant set a high-water mark in the diesel’s long development. With Europe’s high fuel costs, the more expensive (yet efficient) diesel engine could now pay for itself quite easily. The calculation triggered Europe’s diesel-boom, resulting in a 50 percent market share vs. gasoline-engined propulsion. 
 
But Europeans have been paying a price (other than at the pumps): particulate emissions (Particulate Matter, or “PM”) and NOx pollution. Many European cities have serious particulate and diesel odor problems. Several European cities impose restrictions on diesels during PM alerts. 
 
The new generation of “clean(er)” diesels that meet the US Tier2 bin5 standards cut PM emissions substantially, but not completely. Already, there are warnings that PM from “clean” diesels still poses a significant health risk. 
 
The diesels coming our way carry several other penalties, especially versus the gas hybrid. The complicated and expensive NOx catalysts and urea injection schemes (“BlueTec”) cut efficiency by five percent. Meanwhile, the next Prius is projected to be 15 to 20 percent more efficient. And Toyota is bringing down hybrid production costs. 
 
The diesel vs. hybrid mileage\/cost gap widens… further. And the “clean” diesel’s just-barely compliant emissions still can’t touch the gas-hybrid’s practically breathable exhaust. 
 
Then there’s the elephant in the room: global warming. Clearly, the political winds are blowing against CO2. Diesel fuel has higher carbon content, resulting in 17 percent more CO2 per gallon of fuel burned than gasoline. With the diesel’s efficiency superiority down to 25 percent, a “clean” diesel emits only 13 percent less CO2 than yesterday’s gas engine. And that small gap is… wait… gone. 
 
While the diesel’s efficiency peaked in 1989, and lost 5 percent to PM cleansing, gas engine development is on a roll. Engineers are systematically tackling all the inherent deficiencies that Diesel identified in his hospital bed. (No wonder Rudolf was considered paranoid; maybe he suspected that eventually the Otto engine would catch up.) 
 
A number of new gas-engine technologies has converged, which Europeans have been quick to embrace. VW’s 1.4-liter 170hp TSI gas engine is a perfect example of the trend. The TSI starts off with the help of a supercharger (no turbo-lag), and then switches to turbocharging (no parasitic losses). With diesel-like torque and direct injection, it’s the best of both worlds. 
 
A CO2 output comparison with two other similar-output VW engines is telling. Their 170 horse 1.4-liter TSI produces 174g\/kms of CO2. Their 150hp 2.5-liter five cylinder engine (US Rabbit only) emits 240g\/km. And their 170hp 2.0-liter TDI diesel (not US compliant) produces 160g\/km. 
 
American Rabbit drivers are paying a whopping 38 percent efficiency penalty compared to the Euro-Golf TSI, as well as giving up gobs of torque and twenty horsepower. If VW’s 170hp TDI were “cleansed” to T2b5 standards, its CO2 output would be no better then the gasoline TSI. 
 
And that’s just the jumping-off point. Start-stop technology, full valve control, and stratified direct-injection offer anywhere from 10 to 25 percent further improvement potential. Combine these goodies with mild-hybrid assist\/regeneration, and the diesel party’s kaput. No wonder the Germans are all hard at work on mild-hybrid technology. It’s their best shot to keep up with Toyota’s CO2 meister, the Prius (102g\/km). 
 
A study by the consulting firm AT Kearny confirms the diesel’s demise. It predicts that only 25 percent of Europeans will find diesels an attractive economic proposition by 2020. 
 
Have Rudolf Diesel’s paranoid nightmares come true? Not totally. Diesels are a welcome mix to the party for larger vehicles that spend a lot of time on the open road. Count on GM’s new 4.5-liter “baby” Duramax diesel to be more popular with the light-truck crowd than the gas hybrid option. But when it comes to smaller vehicles, the numbers just don’t add up. 
 
Although Rudolf Diesel’s engine WAS intrinsically more efficient, it turns out that Otto’s engine is a lot more clever at learning new tricks. 
 
  
 

 
( Update 9\/22\/2015 )   That article unleashed quite a reaction at the time, as the second American diesel love-affair was just really getting under way in the US. I was branded a “diesel hater” and “hybrid lover”, a rep that I’ve had a hard time shaking, since I have been a diesel skeptic for a long time. Ironically, I’ve somewhat softened my stance in the past few years, in part because the “Clean Diesels” from VW really did seem to be a surprisingly workable solution to the very stringent new US and EU emission standards. Well, that delusional party’s over. 
 
My skepticism has primarily hinged on the following long-term view: that hybridization (with super-efficient gas Atkinson-cycle engines ) offers better overall efficiency, is much cleaner, has lower CO output (because diesel has a higher CO content per gallon), and is the right technology to segue into the inevitable electrification of the automobile. I’m not saying all cars will be hybrid or electric by any given particular time frame, but the intrinsic efficiency and potential CO benefits of EVs does mean that as battery technology inevitable improves over time, their market share will also inevitable increase. It may take a while. Meanwhile, VW is drastically stepping up its future hybrid\/EV product plans. 
 

 
In the meantime, hybridization and ever-more efficient gas engines, which are much easier and cheaper to “clean”, have already put a crimp in the diesel’s advantage. Europe, which subsidized diesels by lowering the tax on it, created a huge diesel boom that many countries were already starting to regret. There has been a growing anti-diesel movement afoot in Europe, especially in big cities, because of emissions concerns. Some cities are proposing bans on diesels. 
 
This huge VW crisis will only speed that inevitable process up. VW’s cheating was even more rampant in Europe than in the US, and this will fuel a more rapid move away from diesels, most likely by removing the tax advantages of diesel fuel, and possibly more draconian measures. 
 
Will diesels disappear soon? Of course not. They can make a lot of sense, especially in larger vehicles: SUVs, light trucks and large trucks, although in the US, even that is in question. UPS is switching its massive fleet of delivery vehicles to gas engines, as they are simply more cost effective in the long term (lower initial cost, lower maintenance). 
 
And refineries in the US and Europe are designed to produce a certain ratio of gasoline to diesel, which optimizes the refinery process. Any significant change in those ratios would require massive investments. 
 
But there’s no question that this current crisis created by VW will have a very significant impact on the diesel’s market share, image and reputation. Americans in particular, who are typically more nimble in their buying habits\/fads, have shown themselves to be willing to abandon diesels before, after the Olds V8 diesel fiasco, and will almost certainly now do so again. 
 
But Europe will not be spared this shift either. It will take time, but the diesel’s best days are done and over. This is just the coffin nail on what I predicted to happen eight years ago. Ironically, the very company that popularized the modern direct injection diesel engine is the one wielding the hammer.. Inhabitat’s Week in Green: 3D-printed suites and a new Prius. Each week our friends at Inhabitat recap the week’s most interesting green developments and clean tech news for us — it’s the Week in Green. 
 
Researchers at the University of Michigan are making waves in solar panels — literally. It turns out that their undulating photovoltaic strips can collect up to 30 percent more energy than flat arrays. In other energy news, China and Pakistan just announced plans to build the world’s largest solar farm in the Punjabi desert, and Aspen, Colorado, just became the third city in the US to be powered entirely by renewable energy. Heads up students — we’re giving away three solar energy-generating Voltaic backpacks and you can win one here. Voltaic also just launched a new solar-powered light that shines for 30-plus hours on a single charge. And designer Pauline van Dongen debuted a solar parka that keeps you charged when you journey off the grid. 
 
The Toyota Prius is the world’s best-selling hybrid — and this past week we caught a first look at its successor. The all-new fourth-generation Prius features sportier looks, pumped-up specs and 10 percent better gas mileage. Meanwhile, Nissan just upgraded the Leaf electric vehicle with a new battery that allows it to drive 107 miles on a single charge. Russia just announced a major commitment to green vehicles: By November 2016 every gas station in the country must install an EV charger. Everyone knows that gasoline-powered vehicles produce toxic emissions and smog, but a picture’s worth a thousand words: You won’t believe what Beijing looked like before and after the city pulled many of its 5 million registered cars off the road. And in the craziest transportation story of the week, a team of architects proposed transforming London’s Underground into a gigantic moving walkway.3D-printing technology continues to shake up the field of architecture — last week a hotel in the Philippines unveiled the world’s first 3D-printed suite. It took just five days to create the suite, which comes complete with a printed concrete whirlpool. Air-purifying buildings sound like science fiction, but one just became fact in the Netherlands. Designer Daan Roosegaarde has created a tower that can purify 30,000 cubic meters of air in a single hour. Could humans inhabit Mars in the near future? Elon Musk thinks we can — and this week he proposed dropping nukes on the red planet to prepare it for terraforming.. Why Scandal Claimed VW’s CEO, While GM And Toyota’s Survived.

Kurt Busch Crew Chief Tony Gibson is Top MOOG® 'Problem Solver' in Chase Opener at Chicagoland Speedway. Southfield, Michigan, September 22, 2015.Tony Gibson, crew chief for Kurt Busch and the No. 41 Haas Automation Chevrolet SS, won the MOOG ® Steering and Suspension brand's ""Problem Solver of the Race"" Award after Busch finished third in Sunday's myAFibRisk400.com 400 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup event at Chicagoland Speedway, Joliet, Ill. Gibson's win, coming in the opening round of the 10-race Chase for the Sprint Cup, moves him into a six-way tie for third place in the MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" standings. MOOG is the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by global vehicle components manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly MOOG Problem Solver Award is presented to the crew chief whose car posts the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The MOOG-equipped 41 car improved by a race-high 0.529-seconds per lap on the mile-and-a-half oval. 
    
Busch, who started ninth, ran in the lead pack for most of the afternoon. He had advanced to fifth within the first 60 laps before being forced onto pit road after losing air in a tire and making contact with the wall. He quickly regained the lost ground and was running second after passing his brother, Kyle Busch (No. 18 Toyota), on Lap 147. The 41 car briefly led on Lap 222 before a scheduled pit stop, then regained the lead on Lap 245.  Busch ultimately lost out to the MOOG-equipped No. 11 and 19 Toyotas of Denny Hamlin and Carl Edwards, respectively, in the final five-lap green flag run, with Hamlin picking up his second win of the year. 
 
""Kurt and Tony were in great position on the final restart but it looked like Denny had a little more left on his tires and he made a gutsy move to grab the lead,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""The key to success in the Chase is to improve your position every week, so even though they didn't get the win, I'm sure the 41 team is happy with their performance."" 
 
With nine races remaining, the $100,000 MOOG Problem Solver of the Year Award remains within range for as many as eight crew chiefs. Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Six crew chiefs - including Gibson - are just two wins back. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

HUG#1953829. Toyota's Mirai hydrogen car arrives. Toyota will be launching its Mirai fuel cell car soon in California in the teeth of falling gas prices, a paltry network of hydrogen f 

ueling stations and media infatuation with Tesla that is finally expected to build salable version of its much-delayed Model X SUV. 

There are only a handful of hydrogen stations up and running in the Golden State, but the California Fuel Cell Partnership has plans for 40 stations to operate by the end of 2016 and 100 by 2020. The state of California is spending about $20 million a year on the project. 

""We like fuel cells because it is the lightest solution,"" said Chris Hostetter, Toyota group vice president of strategic planning. ""It has cost advantages over electric vehicles because we are making the electricity on board rather than pulling it from the grid."" 

Toyota is not the first to bring a hydrogen fuel cell car to market. Honda sold a handful of its FCX Clarity fuel cell cars between 2008 and this year, but it ended production with the 2015 model year. It is expected to launch another fuel cell model sometime in the next two years. Hyundai recently launched a fuel cell version of its Tucson in 2013 it has sold only about 300 so far. 

But Toyota is making a very aggressive bet that fuel cell vehicles could over time equal or surpass plug-in electric hybrids in consumer acceptance. 

The Mirai was conceived about the same time as the Prius gas-electric hybrid, in the early 1990's. 

The sales goals in the U.S. are modest. With only 200 to 300 being shipped by the end of this year, with a goal of selling 3,000 in this country by the end of 2017. 

At a sticker price of $58,250 before tax credits, Mirai won't be inexpensive, but most early customers are expected to lease it for about $500 a month. And Toyota is kicking in three years or $15,000 worth of hydrogen which has recently sold in the range of $7 to $13 per kilogram. 

The only emission is water. 

Next year there will be another set of fueling stations funded by Toyota and partner Air Liquide that will stretch from New Jersey through New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 

Range of Mirai at one fill is 312 miles, while an optional power take off (PTO) feature that can deliver up to 9 kilowatts (kW) of power (60 kWh total), enough for emergency situations. 

Carbon footprint debate? 

At first glimpse the car looks distinctive, and some will say, strange. The front hood is wrapping with a belt-like edge that elevates it from the grille which is highlighted by two trapezoids sitting beneath the narrow head lamp slits. From the rear Mirai appears more mainstream. 

For the first-adopter eco-conscious consumer, there is debate about whether the Mirai is actually casting a smaller carbon foot print than most plug-in electric vehicles. 

""The challenge for hydrogen vehicles is that in terms carbon footprint they are much cleaner than gasoline cars, but they are nowhere near as clean as plug-in cars,"" said John Voelcker, senior editor of Green Car Reports. 

One kilowatt hour of electricity can be used to recharge a battery that, in turn, powers a car. Or you can create one kilowatt hour of electricity by refining hydrogen from a feed stock, most commonly natural gas, which is extracted from a well or through hydraulic fracturing. That hydrogen then is compressed and fed into a fuel cell to create electricity, but losing about 40% of the hydrogen in the process, Voelcker said. 

""For the same kilowatt-hour of electricity you're getting about a third as many miles from the fuel car vehicle,"" he said. 

But hydrogen wins from a convenience perspective. If you're near a fueling station it's just as quick as filling up with gasoline or diesel. 

The carbon footprint equation also can change if the hydrogen is created from renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines. 

Subhead 

As with the Prius, Mirai is not driven by a short-term business case. It won't be sexy. Silicon Valley media star and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk has dismissed the technology as ""fool"" cells. 

Because Toyota has such a broad product portfolio and is currently the most profitable mainstream automaker, it has the patience to see whether hydrogen mobility works in the long run. 

""Toyota really doesn't have high financial expectations for Mirai. It is not positioned at a Tesla killer,"" said Mike Millikin, editor of the Green Car Congress. ""It's a significant step in a long-term strategy."" 

To underscore how incremental the marketing of Mirai is, Toyota is interviewing prospective owners to make sure they live within a feasible distance from a fueling station. Driving along I-5 from the Mexican border to Oregon probably won't work, at least until there are more than a few stations along that route. 

Than again, this is about yet another option in our growing menu of mobility options. 

""Germany sees it. Most of the Scandanavian countries see it,"" Hostetter said. ""In Japan the government is very strongly behind it, partly because of the backlash against nuclear power after Fukushima,"" referring to the nuclear plant that was destroyed by the tsunami of March 2. Toyota's off-roader: cruising back into the spotlight. Toyota has unveiled the newest edition of its iconic Land Cruiser, which has been in a state of constant innovation both inside and out since making its debut some 60 years ago. 

The new Toyota Land Cruiser is an evolution from the outside -- a sharper but familiar grille, daytime LED running lights and special attention paid to eliminating anything that could possibly impede on the car's off-road approach or departure angles. 

And thanks to new Multi-Terrain-Select (MTS) technology to simplify everything from locking differentials, to stepping-down gear ratios and feeding the right amount of power to the right wheel at the right time, taking full advantage of the car's off-road capabilities has never been easier -- especially if specified with automatic transmission. 

MTS has five default settings for coping with everything from mud and sand to loose rocks and will take over the throttle angle, braking and traction control to suit. The car also offers a choice of five speed settings -- think of it as off-road cruise control -- for careful, controlled ascents and descents and for automatically getting unstuck from mud or snow. 

Serious off-roaders can go for the manual transmission option and get more hands on with the Land Cruiser's capabilities, but even they will appreciate the car's self-leveling suspension, sonar (for gauging wading depth and clearance) and the fact that the wheels are digitally rather than physically linked via the suspension system so that the whole shell doesn't sway from side to side when one wheel hits a dip. 

Inside, creature comforts and materials are on a par with the Land Rover's smarter sibling, the Range Rover. Piano black wood-grain veneer is a new dashboard option, for example as is a standalone multimedia system for rear-seat passengers. 

As for engines, the new Land Cruiser gets a new 2.8-liter diesel engine that has been tailored to deliver optimum torque off road and the best fuel efficiency and predictability when cruising at motorway speeds. Toyota claims that thanks to a urea selective catalytic reduction system, 99% of NOx emissions are eliminated and while it's not lightning quick -- 0-100km\/h in 12.7 seconds, it offers an economy of 7.4l\/100km for the five-door, seven seat model and 7.2l\/100km for the three-door five seat version. 

Those looking for a little more grunt can go for a 4-liter V6 petrol engine instead, but it is only available for the larger five-door model.

 (Tangi Quemener) The electric powered BMW i8 (R) and i3 are seen next to a charging point at the 66th IAA auto show in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany, on September 15, 2015 . Frankfurt (AFP) - Facing tougher emission standards, European automakers are rushing to roll out hybrid cars, but they face an uphill battle to catch up with Toyota which popularised the technology 18 years ago. The Japanese giant will be showing its latest Prius -- the fourth edition since 1997 -- at the IAA motor show in Frankfurt this week. A Mercedes electric drive car is  plugged for charging during the 66th  IAA auto show in Frankfurt am Main,  western Germany, on September 15, 2015 (AFP Photo\/Daniel Roland) Almost two decades ago, few expected the car with a complex technology combining a petrol engine with battery-powered generators to become a hit. In fact, the concept is not new, and Porsche lays claim to the first petrol-electric car prototype built by its founder as early as 1900. But it is the Japanese giant that has managed to popularise the technology, first with 17,600 units in 1998, before sales exploded with its more spacious second-generation Prius. Today, the car has become a symbol of environmental responsibility and Toyota's rivals, including Honda, Nissan, General Motors and Ford, have jumped into the game. However, Toyota has enjoyed a substantial lead, having already sold more than eight million hybrids. The Prius is by far the top-selling new car in Japan, where the hybrid market makes up close to 40 percent of total sales. By comparison, hybrids make up just three percent of the US market -- and the share is shrinking with dropping petrol prices. The hybrid has also remained a largely marginal affair on the other side of the Atlantic. But it is slowly ""starting to find a market because the cost equation is starting to balance out for some consumers,"" said Francois Jaumain from PwC. Notably, several European governments offer subsidies or lower tax rates for owners of hybrid or electric vehicles.

German carmakers join race Flavien Neuvy, who heads the Cetelem observatory on automobiles, added that consumers feel more confident about hybrids because, unlike with fully electric vehicles, drivers are less worried about being stranded at the side of the road given the petrol backup. He believes that hybrid sales in Europe could rise to 10 percent of total volume. Europe's latest emissions standard -- Euro 6 which took effect September 1 -- has also made hybrids more attractive as it will increase the cost of running cars powered by polluting diesel fuel. In addition, car markets are required to meet the EU target of 95 g\/km of CO2 emissions by 2020, giving them further incentives to find greener solutions. According to a study by credit insurer Euler Hermes, Germany is currently trailing with average emissions of 130 g\/km in 2014, dragged down by luxury energy guzzlers, while France has recorded 112 g\/km. The German auto industry is therefore pumping ""massive investments into hybrid and electric technologies"", the study said. That is on full display at the Frankfurt show.
The new electric Porsche Mission E concept car is presented at the 66th IAA  auto show in Frankfurt am Main, Western Germany, on September 14, 2015  (AFP Photo\/Odd Andersen) BMW is showcasing its new rechargeable hybrids, while rival Mercedes-Benz expects to launch 10 models by 2017. Volkswagen already has one hybrid version of its best-selling Golf line. Audi and Porsche too are in the race. Absent for now, however, are the French makers. PSA Peugeot Citroen, whose high-end diesel hybrids have so far failed to gain traction commercially, has indicated that it will launch hybrid gas-electric cars by the end of the decade. Renault meanwhile is banking on electric cars. It has so far not produced any hybrids although its chief executive Carlos Ghosn said he does not rule out the possibility that its recently presented Talisman line would one day be hybrid.. Race Strategy Pays Off for Greg Biffle Crew Chief Matt Puccia with Top-5 Finish and MOOG® 'Problem Solver' Honors at Loudon. Southfield, Michigan, September 29, 2015.Matt Puccia, crew chief for the No. 16 Kleen Performance Products Ford Fusion, rolled the dice by keeping his driver, Greg Biffle, on the track while other teams were opting for fuel and new tires in the final 85 laps of Sunday's Sylvania 300 NASCAR ® Sprint Cup race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Loudon, N.H. The gamble paid off as the 16 car had just enough fuel to coast over the finish line in fourth place. Following the race, Puccia received the prestigious ""Problem Solver of the Race"" crew chief award from MOOG ® , the Official Steering and Suspension of NASCAR. 
 
Sponsored by MOOG Steering and Suspension parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Motorparts, a division of Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ( NASDAQ: FDML ), the weekly Problem Solver award is presented to the crew chief whose car delivers the greatest second-half improvement in average lap time while finishing on the lead lap. The Roush-Fenway Racing-owned 16 car, which started 25 th , improved by a race-high 0.389-seconds per lap in earning its third top-five finish of 2015. The race was won by Matt Kenseth and the MOOG-equipped No. 20 Toyota Camry. 
    
Biffle was running 15 th with 85 laps to go when Puccia made the call to finish without additional fuel or new tires. Although he was backing off the throttle to conserve fuel, Biffle briefly took the lead following a restart with 60 laps to go, dropped back to fourth but then fought off several challenges over the final green-flag segments to finish in the top five. 
 
""The 16 ran out of fuel right as it crossed the finish line, so Puccia couldn't have been any closer with his calculations,"" said Tim Nelson, director of motorsports for Federal-Mogul Motorparts. ""Matt absolutely nailed their chassis setup for the final 100 laps. Greg was running on old rubber but was still able to fight off challenges from several drivers."" 
 
Puccia's weekly Problem Solver win - his first - leaves the top of the standings unchanged in the battle for the $100,000 MOOG ""Problem Solver of the Year"" Award. With eight races remaining, Dale Earnhardt (No. 88 Chevrolet) crew chief Greg Ives leads with four weekly Problem Solver wins, followed by rookie Justin Alexander (No. 27 Chevrolet\/Paul Menard) with three. Seven crew chiefs have two wins apiece. 
 
The MOOG brand is the preferred choice of professional technicians and NASCAR crew chiefs. In recognition of the vital importance of steering and suspension components in overall vehicle safety and performance, NASCAR mandates that Cup teams use MOOG Problem Solver parts, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends. Cup Series champions have won with MOOG parts for 49 consecutive years.

HUG#1955450. Stock Analysts’ Downgrades for September, 15th (AGU, BAC, BCS, BLK, BP, DPS, HMY, IR, JWN, KMI). Agrium (NYSE:AGU) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Agrium's profit rose in the second quarter of 2015 on higher volumes in its Wholesale unit. However, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues fell year over year on declines across the board, and missed expectations. The company cut its earnings guidance for 2015 factoring in pricing pressure in the second half. The crop pricing environment is expected to remain soft in the near term. Agrium is also faced with issues such as logistical constraints and challenges from higher Chinese urea exports.” 

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Bank of America’s second-quarter 2015 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of lower non-interest expenses as well as increase in interest income and mortgage banking revenues. However, a slump in trading revenues and investment banking fees, and higher provision for credit losses were the headwinds. We expect balance sheet restructuring efforts, expense reduction initiatives and improving asset quality to steadily bolster the company’s bottom-line growth. Further, conditional approval of its capital plan indicates overall balance sheet strength. Nevertheless, pressure on net interest yield, along with lower trading volumes, will continue to hurt top-line growth in the near term.” 

Barclays (NYSE:BCS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Barclays’ first-half 2015 results reflected successful cost-curtailment measures and improvement in Investment Banking performance. However, a number of legal provisions and declining net operating income were the undermining factors. The decision to remove Chief Executive Antony Jenkins will likely help the company become more profitable through faster cost-cuts. Nevertheless, the company continues to face several headwinds. Primarily, muted top-line growth and a stringent regulatory landscape will likely weigh on the company’s near-term performance. Also, issues related to regulatory investigations will keep hindering its growth prospects.” 

BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “BlackRock’s second-quarter 2015 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by higher revenues. Growth in assets under management (AUM) was another catalyst. However, elevated expenses and long term outflows were the undermining factors. While the company continues to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions to boost performance, its initiatives to enhance market share in the ETF business are expected to aid revenue growth going forward. Also, the company’s enhanced capital deployment activities remain impressive. Nonetheless, weak expense control, high dependence on fee-based revenues and regulatory restrictions on its revenue sources make us apprehensive.” 

BP plc (NYSE:BP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a strong sell rating. According to Zacks, “BP plc’s earnings came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This was mainly due to lower realization. We believe that the company’s strategy of offloading non-core upstream properties will prove beneficial over time, while creating a portfolio with potentially stronger growth from a smaller base. Additionally, BP’s position in the Woodford, Haynesville, Fayetteville, Eagle Ford and Utica shale plays, in association with its vast resource base and profound knowledge in unconventional gas, will aid its natural gas operations going forward.” 

Citigroup (NYSE:C) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Citigroup's second-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by lower expenses while revenues remained relatively stable. Also, the quarter experienced continued improvement in credit quality and exhibited a strong capital position. We believe the company's streamlining initiatives and attractive core business are impressive. Yet, a low interest-rate environment and regulatory issues, along with litigation risks, remain major near-term headwinds.” 

Dr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE:DPS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Dr Pepper has sound long-term fundamentals — strong position in the flavored CSD market, aggressive RCI cost savings and regular cash returns to shareholders. After an exceptional performance in 2014, Dr Pepper delivered solid top line and bottom line results in the first half of 2015 on the back of pricing gains, innovations, powerful marketing programs and productivity improvements. Despite increased currency headwinds, the company raised the 2015 sales and EPS expectations. Improving U.S. consumer sentiments, rational pricing environment, increased marketing support and RCI driven cost savings will boost results in the second half. However, sluggish volumes of its carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, due to CSD category headwinds, are the concerns.” 

Harmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Harmony Gold posted a wider loss on a reported basis in fourth-quarter fiscal 2015, hurt by a sizable impairment related to its Hidden Valley, Doornkop and Phakisa operations. Adjusted earnings were flat year over year. Revenues fell by double-digits,affected by lower gold sales and pricing. Gold production also declined year over year in the quarter. Harmony's operations are likely to be impacted by a slower-than expected ramp-up in production at mines and gold price volatility. It also remains exposed to geopolitical risks associated with potential mine shut downs and labor strikes.” 

Ingersoll-Rand PLC (NYSE:IR) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Ingersoll reported disappointing second-quarter 2015 results, as adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.03. Operating risks from high R&D costs for technology-driven products are expected to weigh on margins in the quarters ahead. Moreover, intense competitive pressure and adverse foreign currency impact are likely to hinder its profitability to some extent. However, Ingersoll is realigning its operational structure to improve the long-term growth prospects and capitalize on high-margin opportunities. A disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet, and healthy cash flow remain positives. Ingersoll also expects to strengthen its position in existing markets through organic growth across industry verticals and maintained its earlier guidance for 2015.” 

Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Nordstrom reported better-than-expected top and bottom line results for second-quarter fiscal 2015 on the back of smooth execution of its customer strategy coupled with robust sales growth driven by its strategic growth investments. Further, the company raised its outlook for fiscal 2015 encouraged by the strong second-quarter results and the reclassification of receivables as ""held for sale"" related to the pending credit card transaction. Consequently, the company witnessed an uptrend in estimates. Additionally, we appreciate the company’s store-expansion strategy, which is expected to boost top-line growth. However, the seasonal nature of the company’s business and increased competition from industry players may prove deterrents.” 

Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Kinder Morgan, Inc, registered a decline in the earnings and revenue during the second quarter. The company’s focus on natural gas has raised concern amid a sluggish natural gas price environment. We are also cautious considering the risks that include an increase in crude oil production and pricing at the CO2 segment, a decline in refined products or natural gas demand, and rising costs associated with organic growth projects.” 

Liberty Global plc – Class A (NASDAQ:LBTYA) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a strong sell rating. According to Zacks, “Liberty Global reported mixed financial results in the second quarter of 2015 wherein the bottom line fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line steered past the same. The company is predominantly operating in Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable region. Ongoing debt crisis in several European countries may significantly affect the future prospect of Liberty Global. The intensely competitive pay-TV market of Germany further adds to the company’s woes. Moreover, high integration risks, mounting programing expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet are major headwinds that face the company presently.” 

LyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “LyondellBasell’s profit jumped in the second quarter of 2015 as it benefited from abundant supply of low-cost natural gas. However, revenues fell by double-digits year over year, affected by lower prices of the company’s products. Adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales missed. LyondellBasell remains on track with its expansion projects that are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings. The company also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging healthy cash flows. However, LyondellBasell is exposed to volatility in raw material and energy costs. Lower crude oil prices may also affect its margins in 2015. Moreover, its operations are subject to maintenance outages.” 

ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “ManpowerGroup’s second-quarter 2015 earnings per share of $1.33 and revenues of $4,861.3 million handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by encouraging performance in Southern Europe. In addition, the Permanent Recruitment business is doing well with revenues growth of 20% on constant currency basis. However, both the metrics disappointed on a year-over-year basis on account of unfavorable forex fluctuations coupled with weak performing Right Management business. Management expects recovery across globe to be slow and patchy going forward.  As recovery is slow, management has adopted a strong pricing and productivity control approach to ensure uninterrupted profitability.” 

Masco Corp (NYSE:MAS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Masco Corporation’s earnings, revenues and margin increased year over year in the first two quarters of 2015. Masco reported strong sales at all segments, except Plumbing, in the first two quarters of 2015. Cost control and productivity improvements drove operating margin. Masco expects stronger demand for its leading products through the rest of 2015, as the repair and remodeling industry continues to improve. Moreover, the cabinet segment, which returned to profitability this quarter, is expected to gain further momentum in the second half of 2015. However, international revenues are being hurt by currency headwinds resulting from a weaker euro compared to the U.S dollar.” 

Meredith (NYSE:MDP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Favorable advertising trends in the digital section and recent acquisitions continue to favorably impact Meredith’s performance. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, wherein earnings of $0.94 per share grew 6.8% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the seventh straight quarter. Though revenues of $426 million came almost in line with the estimate, it grew 9% year over year. Waning print media trends and stiff competition continue to be immediate concerns. Nevertheless, Meredith is focused on bolstering advertising revenues, primarily in the digital space, and is increasingly concentrating on brand licensing, marketing services and e-Commerce. Recently, Media General has announced its decision to acquire Meredith.” 

McCormick & Company, (NYSE:MKC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “McCormick delivered better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Earnings of $0.75 per share increased 17% from $0.64 per share earned a year ago, mainly due to a lower tax rate. Higher adjusted operating income, increased income from unconsolidated operations and lower shares outstanding also benefited earnings. Further, the company has raised its earnings guidance, citing favorable tax rates in fiscal 2015. However, revenues lagged the consensus mark and declined year-over-year due to significant foreign currency headwinds. Excluding currency impact, sales grew 5%. McCormick is focusing on building sales through brand marketing investments and acquisitions. However, McCormick remains apprehensive about higher material costs, which can impact 2015 earnings.” 

Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Microsemi Corporation is an OEM of a broad range of high-reliability and analog\/mixed signal integrated circuits. Fiscal third-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Also, forward revenue guidance was encouraging. Microsemi’s compelling products, scope for margin expansion and decent balance sheet are other positives. However, pockets of weakness related to the high-margin satellite business, product transition at medical customers, push-out of some communications spending in China and a softer oil & gas market will impact revenues. Also, heavy investment in R&D could impact near-term profitability.” 

Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Mylan’s second-quarter earnings were better than expected. We are encouraged by strong sales at the Generics segment. Mylan raised its 2015 guidance. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.15 to $4.35.  However, foreign currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact revenues. We remain concerned about the company’s Specialty segment sales. The company expects to face generic competition for EpiPen Auto-Injector in the second half of 2015. Meanwhile, Mylan remains committed to acquiring Perrigo Company and has launched a formal offer to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of Perrigo.” 

Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Northern Trust’s second-quarter 2015 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from top-line growth and a benefit of credit in provision for credit losses. However, higher expenses and lower net interest margin remained concerns. The company remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value as it announced a dividend hike and a new share repurchase program. Though the thrust of banking regulations might act as deterrents to the company’s fundamentals going forward, strong capital ratios and anticipated increase in asset management and servicing fees based on a significant equity markets improvement and higher volumes are expected to support earnings in the coming quarters.” 

Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE:NWL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Newell, which has been delivering positive earnings surprises for over four years now, reported stellar second-quarter 2015 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and exceeded expectations. Also, Newell raised its outlook for 2015 as it remains confident of delivering positive results in the second half of 2015 as well. Further, the company’s Project Renewal Program aimed at achieving annual cost savings, remains on track. Also, Newell’s solid brand portfolio is one of its key strengths. However, the company’s significant global presence exposes it to adverse currency movements. Despite the raised guidance, Newell expects forex headwinds to have a greater impact on its 2015 earnings as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies.” 

Potash Corp.\/Saskatchewan (NYSE:POT) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Potash Corp.’s profit fell in the second quarter of 2015, hurt by lower nitrogen prices.Earnings trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate whiles sales beat expectations. The company cut the top end of its earnings guidance range for 2015 factoring in pricing pressure and weak nitrogen market fundamentals. Potash Corp. faces headwinds associated with macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from weakness across specific developing markets. It is also exposed to challenges in its nitrogen business and a volatile pricing environment.” 

Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Toyota’s first-quarter fiscal 2016 net income and consolidated revenues improved year over year and surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Toyota expects its earnings, operating income and revenues to increase in fiscal 2016. The company’s focus on product development, capacity increases and expansion in emerging markets are positives. However, weak vehicle sales in Japan, a string of product recalls and large fines are some headwinds.” 

Torchmark (NYSE:TMK) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Torchmark's higher administrative expenses, pension costs and investments in IT systems will likely be a drag on the company's earnings over the near term. For 2015, management lowered the projected earnings range to $4.18–$4.28 from $4.20–$4.40 per share. However, niche market focus, steady capital deployment and strong operating fundamentals should drive long-term growth. The company estimates life and health sales growth in distribution channels. Additionally, strong capital position and capital management are also among other positives. With respect to earnings results, Torchmark's second-quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but improved year over year on higher premium contribution from the life as well as insurance business.” 

UBS AG (NYSE:UBS) was downgraded by analysts at Deutsche Bank from a buy rating to a hold rating. 

Xcel Energy (NYSE:XEL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Xcel Energy has been heavily investing in transmission, generation and distribution projects which are expected to boost its performance going forward.  A large portion of the company’s capital expenditure in the next 4 to 5 years will be directed toward strengthening its transmission and natural gas business. Focus on adding renewables will help the company achieve its target of curbing carbon emissions. However, Xcel Energy’s earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2015 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year due to lower revenues on account of unfavorable weather and a decline in residential sales. Apart from uncertain weather patterns, tighter environmental legislations might also limit the company' profitability.”

Japan orders automakers to probe diesel vehicle emissions for compliance, report by end of the week. More reaction to ‘ Dieselgate ‘, this time from the East – Japan’s transport ministry has begun a probe on diesel vehicles in Japan, the objective being to establish if these cars meet the country’s emission norms, Bloomberg reports. 
 
The country’s Transport Minister Akihiro Ohta told reporters in Tokyo that the ministry has requested automakers – including Toyota, Mazda and Volkswagen – to submit reports on their findings by the end of this week. He added that the government is considering changing the method it uses to test diesel engines, but did not go into detail about the subject. 
 
Japan joins a growing list of countries to begin investigating diesel emission compliance following the crisis that has beset Volkswagen. The German automaker was caught out for having installed illegal “defeat devices” in its diesel-powered cars to help it comply with emissions tests in the US. Countries investigating compliance issues include South Korea, France and the UK. 
 
The fallout has since cost CEO Martin Winterkorn his job and seen the Group’s market value erode by €27 billion euros (RM135 billion), but it doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon. 
 
The report adds that while VW doesn’t sell diesel cars through official channels in Japan, Ohta said that individual buyers have imported around 230 VW and Audi vehicles since 2008. He said the ministry is in the midst of ascertaining if these cars need to be recalled and fixed.

Briefs | BMW CEO collapses during presentation at auto show. BMW CEO Harald Krueger collapsed yesterday during a news conference at the Frankfurt auto show and was helped off stage by staff. His condition was not serious, the company said later. Krueger stumbled backward and fell on his back during the first five minutes of the presentation of the German auto house’s new lineup. Staff rushed to help Krueger back on his feet, and he rubbed the back of his head, looking stunned as he was lifted up and led off stage by staff. BMW spokesman Maximilian Schoeberl said that 49-year-old Krueger had been recently traveling a lot, and was not feeling well ahead of the presentation but decided to go ahead with it. Schoeberl said Krueger, who took over as BMW’s CEO earlier this year, was seen by a doctor following the incident, who recommended that he cancel his other appointments for the day and rest at home. “His condition is not worrisome, they’ve ruled out anything serious,” Schoeberl said. A round table Krueger was to hold with journalists was instead conducted by the company’s CFO. 
 Toyota launches hydrogen-fueled sedan  
Toyota is taking the next step in its quest for carbon-free travel with the launch of the Mirai hydrogen-fueled sedan. The Japanese brand that pioneered the hybrid gas-electric powertrain sees hydrogen cars as the end-game, following plug-in hybrids and full-electric vehicles. The region’s new CEO, Johan van Zyl, told reporters on the sidelines of the Frankfurt auto show on Monday that “It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when,” hydrogen technology will go mainstream. Toyota Europe expects sales of between 50 and 100 Mirai’s this year and next, with 47 ordered to date. It is being sold only in Britain, Germany, Denmark and Belgium, where Toyota is working on getting in hydrogen pumping stations with local partners. Toyota Europe sales chief Karl Schlicht said that current customers include governments and companies looking to reduce their carbon emissions. He expects the technology to be affordable for average consumers by 2025. Toyota Europe last year sold 880,000 cars, up 3 percent from a year earlier. Twenty percent of those were hybrids. Schlicht forecasts sales will be down 1-2 percent this year due to the economic slowdown in Russia.. 2015 Toyota Prado Review | GX, GXL, VX And Kakadu - New Engine, New Appeal. The Skinny: While cosmetic improvements are thin on the ground in the updated 2016 Toyota Prado range, the all-new diesel engine is a solid winner; it's new-found refinement transforms this capable, hard-working 4X4 SUV. 
 
There is a quietness and smoothness to the new engine that we're unused to in a Toyota diesel. And that refinement comes with the benefit of more power, more torque and more efficiency. It's also more frugal. 
 
There is a downside to this good news: the 2016 Prado will cost you more for the privilege. The V6 petrol remains unchanged, except for a small price rise, but it's a minor player in the showroom. 
 
Vehicle Style: Large SUV 
Price: $52,990 (GX 5-seat manual diesel) to $84,490 (Kakadu 7-seat auto diesel) 
 
Engine\/trans: 
 130kW\/450kW 2.8 litre turbo diesel 4cyl | 6sp manual or 6sp auto  207kW\/381Nm 4.0 litre petrol 6cyl | 6sp auto  
Fuel Economy claimed: 7.9 l\/100km (manual diesel), 8.0 l\/100km (auto diesel), 11.6 l\/100km (auto petrol)| tested: 8.5 l\/100km (auto diesel) 
 OVERVIEW  
Is… is that the new LandCruiser Prado ? It’s a bit hard to tell - after all, the box-fresh 2016 model we just spent the day driving is externally identical to the facelifted model that went on sale in late 2013. 
 
But there’s one difference under the skin, and it’s major. While the outgoing model was propelled by a clattery, agricultural 3.0 litre turbodiesel, the 2016 Prado gets Toyota’s new 2.8 litre turbo-diesel four-cylinder with a refinement that’s worlds apart from its predecessor. 
    
It’s the same engine that will equip the new HiLux and Fortuner 4x4s expected later this year, and its a very good one. 
 
Yes, a 4.0 litre petrol V6 remains available in the range, but honestly, why would you choose it when you have a diesel option this smooth? 
 
Only 1.2 percent of Prado sales are for the petrol V6, and we’re willing to bet a few of those petrol Prado shoppers will convert to diesel once they experience the refinement of this new 2.8 litre. 
 
What’s more, the new 2.8 is accompanied by an equally-fresh six-speed automatic, rather than the old-tech five-speed of the outgoing 3.0 diesel. It too is a revelation. 
 
Whether on the highway or on a steep dirt-track, the newfound civility.of this new powertrain takes the Prado to a whole new level. 
 THE INTERIOR  Standard features (all models): Cruise control, air-conditioning, rear-view camera, keyless entry and ignition, 220-volt rear power outlet, alloy wheels.  Infotainment: Bluetooth and USB connectivity, display audio headunit, iPod compatibility, audio controls on steering wheel. Prado GXL (and up) get sat-nav and 7-inch touchscreen display as standard.  
Sadly, the revolutionary changes made under the bonnet didn’t have any effect on what’s on the driver's side of the firewall. The interior of the 2016 Prado is much the same as last year’s model. 
 
Unless, of course, you’re driving a GXL. Already the most popular model in the Prado range, the GXL gets sat-nav as standard equipment. 
    
The rest of it is the same. The same trim, same equipment and the same big, comfy seats. 
 
Though it's the smaller sister to the LandCruiser 200 Series, the Prado is a roomy wagon in its own right with plenty of room for seven (or five, if you go for the entry-model GX). 
 
Designed with long-range cruising in mind, the comfort level is appropriately high. The VX and Kakadu in particular are an especially nice environment to soak up the miles in, with leather upholstery and heated first- and second-row seats. 
    ON THE ROAD  Diesel: 130kW\/450Nm (420Nm manual) 2.8 litre turbo diesel inline four  Petrol: 207kW\/381Nm 4.0 litre naturally-aspirated petrol V6  Transmission: Six-speed manual (diesel) or six-speed automatic (petrol and diesel), full-time 4x4 with dual-range transfer case  Suspension: Double-wishbone independent front, live-axle rear. Adjustable dampers on Kakadu, swaybar disconnect on VX and Kakadu  Steering: Hydraulic power steering, 11.6 metre turning circle  
Fire up the Prado’s new 2.8 litre diesel and relish the smoothness, ""ah... the serenity"" of its outstanding refinement. 
 
While the old 3.0 was properly truck-like, the new 2.8 is far better-behaved as far as sound and vibration are concerned. At idle and at a high-speed cruise, it’s barely any louder and intrusive than a petrol motor. 
    
The benefits don’t stop there. With 130kW of power and 450Nm of torque (420Nm for manuals), the new 1GD diesel makes 3kW and 40Nm more than the old 3.0 litre. 
 
It’s also more frugal, with Toyota listing a combined-cycle fuel economy of 7.9 l\/100km for the manual and 8.0 l\/100km for the auto - a reduction of 0.6 l\/100km and 0.8 l\/100km respectively. We can attest to its meagre thirst, averaging 8.5 l\/100km for the auto. 
 
The new diesel is also EuroV emissions compliant - as is the slightly-revised petrol V6. 
    
We drove both the manual and automatic diesel at the 2016 Prado’s local launch in the ACT, the former in GXL config and the latter in range-topping Kakadu form. 
 
In either flavour, it’s an impressive improvement. 
 
Cruising in sixth at 100km\/h the engine is spinning at 2000rpm, right in the meaty part of its torque band. Its variable-geometry turbo builds boost reasonably quickly and turbo lag is minimal and barely noticeable. 
 
That said, it’s not the most alert engine as far as throttle response goes. You tend to feel its weight if trying to accelerate up inclines, particularly in the 2.4-tonne Prado Kakadu. 
 
While it is far less troubled on the flat, and can get out and overtake quickly with a bit of a prod, try to accelerate from 100km\/h up a steeper grade, and it is slow to gain speed even with the accelerator floored. 
    
If you tow heavy loads (and many Prado owners do), that's something to take note of if you inhabit a hilly part of the country. 
 
But as a long-distance cruiser, it’s perfect. As quiet and smooth as petrol-power, yet with the frugality and low-end torque of a diesel, this engine will serve the Prado well. 
 
The suspension is ideally suited to that role as well. There are no changes to the Prado's undercarriage for 2016, and feels stable and comfortable at almost any speed. 
 
If you’re keen on venturing deep into the outback, it’ll keep performing. 
 
The variable-geometry turbine can close off its vanes almost completely to enhance engine braking, and the six-speed automatic’s first gear is lower than the old five-speed’s to give it better crawl performance in low range. 
    
Select low-range, and the Prado's trusted 4X4 drivetrain will easily haul the heavy Prado up steep, rocky fire trails. Madder off-roaders though should note that only the top-grade Kakadu gets a locking rear differential from the factory. 
 
One debit though is the clunky and ineffective downhill assist control - it simply lacks the smoothness and progressiveness required to be of use off-road. 
 SAFETY  
ANCAP rating: 5-Stars - this model scored 35.11 out of 37 possible points. 
 
Safety features: ABS, EBD, brake assist, traction control and stability control are standard across the Prado range. Dual front, front side and full-length curtain (including third row) airbags are also standard, and all seats are equipped with three-point seat belts. 
 
The flagship Prado Kakadu also benefits from rear cross-traffic alert and blind spot monitoring, though the base model only gets a reversing camera and no parking sensors. The GXL adds rear sensors, while the VX gets front and rear sensors as standard. 
 RIVALS TO CONSIDER  
The Prado’s biggest rival is just about to burst onto the scene in the form of the soon-to-be-released Ford Everest. Right now though, the only real match for Toyota’s large SUV in terms of price, size and capability is the Land Rover Discovery. 
 
Toyota is keen to avoid comparisons between the Everest and the Prado (it instead sees the Ford as a Fortuner rival), but it's the pricing that determines the showroom battle, and that makes the Prado the more natural match. 
    TMR VERDICT | OVERALL  
Externally there’s little to report on, but take the 2016 LandCruiser Prado diesel for a drive and you’ll find it’s worlds apart from its predecessor. 
 
Its newfound refinement is a godsend, especially out on the open road. No more rattle, no more diesel knock, this powertrain feels more European than Japanese. 
 
And it’s not at the expense of pulling power or driveability. It’s a real win-win. 
    
The Prado is already a sales success for Toyota, and the new engine is a pearler. Even in its twilight years, this generation Prado is simply getting better with age.

Prado Kakadu 7 seat automatic petrol:. 8 Reasons Why the Tokyo Olympics Will Be the Most Futuristic We've Ever Seen. In 1964, the last time Tokyo hosted the Summer Olympics, the nation revealed one of the biggest mic drops in transportation history: the debut of the shinkansen, the world-famous bullet train that became a Japanese icon. The first high-speed train in the world, it spurred similar technology to spread to Europe and other East Asian nations, paving the way for current maglev trains and, arguably, the Hyperloop. 
 
Nations often introduce revolutionary new technology to the world at the Olympic Games. And the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be incredible. 
 
Tokyo is one of the most futuristic, complex, and sophisticated cities on Earth. It has the busiest train station in the world (Shinjuku station sees 3.64 million people pass through per day ). It has the second most Fortune 500 companies in the world, the tallest tower in the world , and the busiest urban transport system in the world. 
  
  
  
Emerging tech in Japan is going to change how we experience the Olympics in 2020, and could even change world.

 1. A Village of Robots 
 
Japan is one of the most automated nations on Earth . The major robotics industries in the US, China, Korea, Germany, France, and other countries  work with—and compete with—the robot builders in Japan. So naturally, we’ll see an army of robots swarming Japan during the event. Enough to populate a small village, which is exactly what the Olympics committee wants to do. 
 
Last week, Asahi Shimbun  reported that a government committee is launching a program to install robots around the city, in “an initiative toward a ‘universal future society’ where robots and information technologies that assist humans regardless of age, nationality or disabilities are commonplace.” 
 
This “robot village” will be in Tokyo’s Odaiba neighborhood, which will also be home to the athletes’ Olympic Village. (It’s already home to a 60-foot Gundam statue .) But they will be far from the only robots in the capital for the Games. Here’s the idea: Many of the 920,000 foreigners expected to populate Tokyo per day during the Olympics can call for nearby robots to help with language translation, directions, or beckon for transportation—transportation that itself could be robotic, self-driving cars. From area hotels to shops to Tokyo’s Haneda International Airport , helpful, personal, polite robots will coexist along the millions of humans to carry their luggage, check them into their lodging, or drive them to sightsee at Tokyo Skytree .

 2. Instant Language Translation  
The English skill level in Japan, compared to other advanced nations, is low . And while the number of foreigners learning to speak Japanese has skyrocketed in the last decade , there’re still significant language and cultural barriers that tourists run into. That’s why Japan is rolling out cutting-edge instant translation technology for 2020. 
 
The country’s government-bankrolled National Institute of Information and Communications Technology offers VoiceTra, a real-time translation app that accommodates 27 languages for text translation, including Urdu and Bhutan’s Dzongkha. Voice translation is a bit harder; the agency says the app understands 90% of spoken content. It covers English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese so far and is expected to accommodate over 10 languages by 2020. The software will be available on computers and phones and at tourist-dense spots like landmarks and shopping centers and for safety, hospitals. 
 
Meanwhile in the private sector, Panasonic is making a palm-sized gadget worn around the neck that’ll translate Japanese into 10 languages for the thousands of visitors set to descend on the metropolis. The electronics giant also plans to provide visitors with a smartphone app that scans Japanese signs and translates them on the spot. These are services that could be useful in countries across the globe.

 3. Self-Driving Taxis  
We’ve previously reported on the Robot Taxi plans from DeNA , the Japanese gaming giant that’s planning to get driverless taxis on Tokyo’s roads by the 2020 Olympic Games. That’s a significant achievement when some of the biggest names in tech—Google, Apple, Uber —plus car manufacturers like BMW, Toyota, and Mercedes are all scrambling to be the first to get fully functioning autonomous vehicles on the road. 
 
But Tokyo is the biggest, densest city on planet Earth: 13 million humans, 4,600 people per square mile. Plus during the Olympics, it’s estimated a whopping 920,000 foreigners will roam the megalopolis on any given day. If Japan gets driverless taxis on Tokyo streets in time for the Olympics, it’s going to be an insane test run.

 4. TV Broadcasts in Glorious 8K  
Japanese state television broadcaster NHK plans to air the Olympic Games in tantalizingly detailed 8K high definition . Just like the color TV boom of the 1960s, Japanese companies are hoping to make the new, ultra-vivid image quality the de facto viewing on screens in Japan and beyond. 
 
The made-in-Japan resolution, Japan Times  reports , offers next-generation screen resolution: 7,680 by 4,320 pixels, or 16 times as many pixels as current HD. NHK has been at the definitive global forefront of 8K development, having started researching it way back in 1995 . If anyone is bringing 8K to the world, it’s Japan, and it’ll be going gangbusters at the Olympics. 

 
Next month, Japanese electronics company Sharp will start selling 8K TVs—at $125,000 a pop. Clearly, those 85-inch 8K displays aren’t meant for average consumers—for now. By 2020, NHK wants those TVs in consumer homes. Maybe demand will go up once viewers get HD viewing of their favorite sports: like baseball, surfing, or wushu, all contenders for new sports to be added to the Olympics schedule in 2020.

 5. Algae As a Fuel Source  
We’ve written before about the benefits of using algae as a fuel source for jets and buses, and how Japan in particular is eyeing it as an attractive energy alternate for the nuclear-nervous Fukushima region . And big global names like Boeing backing the plans, which can lead to greater commercialization worldwide. 
 
Algae has remarkable potential as an alternative energy source. It sucks in carbon dioxide and converts it into energy. It’s preferable to other green energies that are grown on land, like oil made from corn, because it can produce 60 times more oil per acre and is relatively easy to grow. What’s more, if you stick algae plants next to carbon-spewing coal plants, the algae can actually decrease the emissions level in the vicinity, all while cranking out useable power. The problem is that Algae’s super expensive—making a liter of the stuff costs about $2.50, and that cost needs to be closer to 80 cents to be a viable alternative. 
 
But Boeing wants to help Japan fly Olympic tourists to the island nation on jets fueled by algae. As part of a consortium of over 40 organizations, including the University of Tokyo, the Japanese government, Japan Airlines, and All Nippon Airways, Boeing aims to offer algae flights on these major Japanese airlines for the millions of tourists expected to visit Japan in 2020. Which is good, since algae can cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 percent , compared to petroleum fuels. 
 
If Boeing and the others can prove that algae can be cost efficient, effective, and useful on a scale as large as the Olympics, we could start seeing a lot more international flights running on green.

 6. Hydrogen-Powered Buses and Buildings  
Speaking of power, Japan is rolling out another alternate energy that could be a global game-changer. It’s the most abundant element in the universe: hydrogen. 
 
According to the Wall Street Journal , the Tokyo government plans to spend 40 billion yen ($330 million) in the next five years to improve hydrogen energy use leading up to the Olympics, making Japan a “Hydrogen Society.” When hydrogen gas mixes with oxygen in a fuel cell, it’s able to produce exhaust-free energy, just like water can. 
 
The plan is to make the entire Olympic Village hydrogen-powered, complete with at least 100 fuel cell-powered buses, press lounges, and athlete dorms. The government also wants 6,000 of cell-powered cars in the road, AutoBlog reports, with 100,000 on streets by 2025. There’s even going to be a giant pipeline constructed underground that’ll directly funnel the hydrogen into the Olympic Village. It’s part of a bigger plan for Japan as a whole to gin up non-nuclear energy sources after the Fukushima disaster. 
 
Fuel cells are becoming more popular worldwide, and the model of using them in Tokyo 2020 could be easily replicated elsewhere, so long as governments make it a priority: To promote better air quality, the Tokyo municipal government is going so far as to spend $385 million to subsidize purchases of Toyota’s new fuel-cell vehicles.

 7. Artificial Meteor Light Shows  
A Japanese astronomy startup called ALE , CNET , RocketNews24 and the Japan Times  report, wants to shower streams of manmade meteors across the sky, which could make for the most badass opening ceremony ever. 
 
ALE was launched by Lena Okajima, an astronomy professor. The idea is pretty out there—literally. The team is working with Japanese universities to design a cube-shaped microsatellite that’ll be launched into space and, in the world’s first project of its kind, shoot out tiny, inch-wide spheres made out of a secret material. Friction in the air will cause them to glow while racing at five miles per second. Space.com reports that there’s no worry for space junk, since the fake stars burn up upon reentry, like real space projectiles. 
 
Okajima says their carefully guarded chemical makeup lets them glow as much as a magnitude-3 star, making them visible from even smoggy urban centers filled with light-polluting high-rises. She wants them to mimic asteroid shower patterns that are rare in nature. 
 

 
Japanese astronomy startup  ALE plans to create man-made meteors  
 
Okajima says she’ll continue working with scientists and engineers at top Japan universities to make the pie-in-the-sky idea into an actual-in-the-sky show. The individual pellets’ makeup can be tinkered with so that individual stars shine different colors. Sounds like the show would be worth the estimated $4 million price tag. It’s also a valuable study tool: Since real asteroid showers are unpredictable and can’t be controlled, this system could allow scientists to study projectile movement and temperature while they fly through Earth’s atmosphere. 
 8. Even More Maglev Trains  
Japan brought humankind high-speed rail with its shinkansen bullet trains 50 years ago, and now it’s eyeing next-gen rail travel: magnetic levitation. While some countries are arguably more advanced in this area—China’s operated a maglev in Shanghai for 11 years—Japan wants to bring the maglev to Tokyoites by 2020 . JR Central, the railroad company that oversees Japan’s maglev train, hopes to have the train running to Tokyo in time for the 2020 Games, and then to Osaka by 2045. 
 
Earlier this year, Japan broke a land speed record for rail with its maglev train at 374 miles per hour. The country’s looking to further develop its maglev system (the train’s not yet ridable for passengers), as well as expand to countries like the US, going so far as to bankroll half the cost for linking Boston to DC by maglev.

Experimental, emerging technologies are always a challenge to bring to market—throw in the logistical nightmare that is the Olympic Games and there’s plenty of reason to be skeptical of how readily available these innovations will be by 2020. We’ve already covered the Tokyo Games’ two major hiccups: The botched billion-dollar stadium and the plagiarism drama that swirled around the Games’ official logo the entire summer. For a country known for perfectionism and attention to detail, the two very public, embarrassing flubs may make the ambitious plans for 2020 seem even more farfetched. 
 
And yet there have been several incredible moments in Olympics history where the host nation actually debuted technologies that transformed the world. At the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm , electronic timepieces were used on a mass scale for the first time, to measure athlete performance. The event’s huge international crowd also prompted development of the world’s first PA system. 
 
The 1936 Summer Games in Berlin took advantage of recent developments in satellite and television technology, making them the sports event to be broadcast on TV. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics , an IBM supercomputer helped predict weather and pollution. And just last month, IBM announced continued plans to use Watson-grade AI to map pollution trends in the atmosphere in Beijing and beyond. 
 
Considering Tokyo’s status as a tech hub, we could see some of the most badass engineering and technology to come out of an Olympics yet. If robots can provide great customer service during the Tokyo Olympics—a dense urban maze packed with millions of people in humankind’s biggest party—then they have a chance everywhere.

WANT MORE GREAT STORIES LIKE THIS?

CLICK ON ONE OF THESE BUTTONS. New 2016 Toyota Prius revealed. Toyota has revealed the all-new Prius hybrid ahead of its public debut at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show next week. The new Toyota Prius will establish new benchmarks for fuel economy and emissions, says the firm. 

The first Toyota based on the firm’s New Generation Architecture – TNGA for short – it has a lower centre of gravity for better handling, and a more space-efficient (and expensive) double wishbone rear suspension. 



The full hybrid powertrain is new and Toyota says it’s smoother, quieter, more responsive and, significantly, “has a more linear feel that is better aligned to engine speed”. 

No more ‘slipping clutch’ sound effects? 

The firm isn’t disclosing any economy details just yet, but does say the engine has more than 40 per cent thermal efficiency, setting a new world record for a petrol engine. 

There’s a new, smaller and more energy-dense, nickel-metal hybrid battery (lithium ion has been eschewed by the firm). 
New Toyota Prius styling 


Visually, the new Prius marks a big evolution over its two predecessors. It now sports more of a saloon look, despite retaining the rear hatch: this closely aligns it with Toyota’s new hydrogen fuel cell Mirai which recently begun deliveries in the UK.

Did those faulty ignition systems leap out of boxes and install themselves in cars? Daniel Fisher writes at Forbes: Apparently, there is no Vice President In Charge Of Going To Jail at General Motors GM. We can conclude that from the deferred-prosecution deal the auto manufacturer struck with federal prosecutors, under which it will hand over $900 million in criminal penalties for allegedly failing to disclose faulty ignition systems that may have contributed to the deaths of more than 100 people. The settlement is raising eyebrows, not only because GM will pay less than the $1.2 billion Toyota paid last year to settle similar claims over its reporting of unintended acceleration. It also seems to violate new guidelines the Justice Department announced last week directing prosecutors to indict real humans when they pursue criminal charges against corporations. Successful lobbying may be the reason no living, breathing executives go to jail for failing to alert the government about GM's failure-prone ignition switches, which could shut off air bags and cause other problems. Federal laws covering the automobile industry don't have the same criminal punch as other laws designed to enforce environmental regulations, or safety and accountability in industries like pharmaceuticals and banking. ...Prosecutor Preet Bharara in Manhattan accused GM of making ""materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" when it assured consumers and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration its vehicles were safe at the same time as it was investigating whether the switch was defective. Despite widespread reports of failures beginning in 2004, GM didn't notify the NHTSA until February 2014.
Disgusting. I'm guessing the execs on this didn't put their family members in those cars. Here's the upshot: So it appears GM will have to suffer through paying a federal monitor to oversee its safety efforts for the next few years and it agreed to pay $575 million to settle some of the civil suits against it. But it doesn't look like the feds will get a perp walk out of this one. via @overlawyered *
Comments Why are you surprised by this? during a significant portion of this time frame, the US Government was one of the key shareholders in GM. Do you think they would put their business partners in jail? Silly Amy, laws are for little people. Posted by: I R A Darth Aggie at September 23, 2015 4:45 PM I'm interested to see how the VW scandal will shake out compared to this. There's no way any VW exec can face criminal charges if GM gets to skate on this. Right? Posted by: JFP at September 23, 2015 5:40 PM Nice try JFP. But friends of Obama get a different deal than you or me. The US government was a key shareholder of GM and GM is equally involved in the Obama administration. VW, not so lucky. Posted by: Ben at September 23, 2015 6:40 PM ""I'm guessing the execs on this didn't put their family members in those cars."" I'm betting they did. How many failures, out of how many millions of cars? -----
Consistency alert! Don't you insist that you can tell when a food product is produced correctly, and that you should be able to buy anything you want without inspection? That the market will correct misbehavior of a dairy vendor who doesn't do things right? This is a car - just a plain ordinary car. You should be able to tell if there's something wrong with it and just buy another brand, right? There's no need whatsoever for quality controls and production standards for ignition switches, because they are used across several dozen models of car and their owners are smart enough to know when one goes wrong. Right? No Federal penalties are therefore indicated. The market will penalize GM by the mechanism of customers going for Ford and Chrysler and Toyota instead. Posted by: Radwaste at September 23, 2015 8:55 PM ""Don't you insist that you can tell when a food product is produced correctly,"" No, and I don't particularly like when people tell me what I did say -- when it's not what I said. you should be able to buy anything you want without inspection Yes, I should. Posted by: Amy Alkon at September 23, 2015 10:56 PM And let's be clear -- it's government and crony capitalism that are keeping these people out of jail. Posted by: Amy Alkon at September 23, 2015 10:57 PM I'm not interested in playing games of what you may or may not have said so I am just going to quote you directly: http:\/\/www.advicegoddess.com\/archives\/2014\/12\/31\/why_is_it_the_g.html ""Show me that you ""know"" that any of your food is safe. Believing that it is because the government ""inspects"" it is the real logical fallacy here. And as I've written before, it is not in the interests of a business to poison people. People don't go into business for a day or a week, but to earn a consistent living."" Needless to say, Radwaste appears to be correct here in that there is some inconsistency in your stance when it comes to safety inspections for food versus safety inspections for automobiles. You are calling it an ""upshot"" that the government will now have a federal monitor to oversee GM's safety efforts after you have explicitly stated that believing government safety inspections help us to ""know"" that something is safe amounts to a logical fallacy. If it is indeed a logical fallacy then surely government safety oversight cannot be classified as an ""upshot"". (if you start to now argue about differences between ""knowing"" and an improved sense of safety that doesn't constitute a guarantee then i'm going to have to call bullshit on your previous argument with Radwaste where you were the only one talking about a perfect state of knowledge when the entire time they were talking about better odds of safety as opposed to a 100% guarantee) Also... what happened to all this talk about it not being in businesses interests to disregard the safety of consumers? Surely if you were correct this entire problem with faulty ignition systems should have been impossible. It is a parallel argument to assert that just like it isn't in the food industries business interest to poison people, it isn't in the automobile industries business interest to kill people via faulty car components. And yet here we are... faulty ignition components and all. Radwaste has told you this more times than I can count, but I will chime in as well and tell you that one of the proper roles of government is to regulate safe business practices to prevent cost cutting incentives that put profits above public health and safety. In summary, you do appear to have an inconsistent way of approaching food safety and car safety in terms of governments proper role in regulating businesses. Posted by: Artemis at September 24, 2015 2:51 AM Just a few points to note - Amid all of this talk about 'faulty GM ignition switches', let's bear in mind what the 'fault' actually is - namely, that the switch can be moved too-easily from the 'run' position to the 'accessory' position. There's no standard for how easy or hard this should be to do. What generally happened here was that the driver had about 18# of cr*p hanging from the keyring, and they inserted the key in the ignition with the keyring tangled with the key in such a way that the weight of the cr&p on the keyring tended to turn it off. It's not a fault in the sense of a wheel that fell off or a braking system that fell apart - it's an operational characteristic that could be amplified by driver behaviors. Not trying to downplay the seriousness of the problem, merely that it's not as simple as the term 'faulty ignition switch' would suggest. It is claimed that some number of deaths and injuries are 'associated with' the 'faulty ignition switch', but when you look closer, many of these 'associations' come down to little more than 'this person was injured in a car wreck, the car had one of the switches in question, and we can't tell whether or not it had anything to do with the crash.' Most of the fines and penalties that GM is paying are doing precisely zip for the people who were actually hurt. They are being paid to the government for failing to follow procedure. The people who may have been hurt by these things are being compensated separately. The fines amount to little more than an added tax on GM - taken from customers and the shareholders. And it's also $900 million that GM cannot spend on product development and improvement, which might help prevent future issues like this - instead, it just goes down the government rathole. Lots of talk here about how it is the government's job to 'regulate safe business practices to prevent cost-cutting incentives'. Fine talk. But no government regulation or oversight would have prevented this problem from occurring. Government regulation of auto design always results in significant cost increases to the consumer with negligible improvements in safety. Cases in point are things like ABS and airbags, both of which were forced on consumers at significant cost with promises of vast reductions in automobile deaths and injuries - the stats show that their benefits have been marginal at best. The next thing coming is rearview cameras, which consumers will be forced to buy at a cost which equates to hundreds of millions of $$$ per life saved. Government regulation means forced expenditure by auto companies = forced taxation of consumers and stockholders, but without any regard to cost or trade-offs. No government regulation ever considers opportunity cost, things seen vs things not seen, or the law of unintended consequences. The GM 'faulty ignition switch' issue took place in a US auto industry that already had the heaviest level of government regulation of any auto industry in the world, and continued for a long period when the US government effectively owned GM and therefore had complete control over what they did. The 'faulty ignition switch' actually demonstrates the complete inability of government regulation to improve safety or eliminate problems, so it's hard to see how even more regulation will somehow improve things. llater, llamas Posted by: llamas at September 24, 2015 3:37 AM llamas, I hope you don't mind, but I have a few questions for you because you make some claims that I think need additional backing\/support: 1 - ""The fines amount to little more than an added tax on GM - taken from customers and the shareholders."" If it has been determined that GM is materially responsible for certain actions that lead to the deaths of some of their customers, why should the owners of GM (i.e., the shareholders) be insulated from profit losses? If you were to own a private business that was found responsible for injuring a customer then you would suffer personal financial losses as a result of your business being forced to pay fines\/compensation by the court. Why should this be any different for the owners of a public company? 2 - ""But no government regulation or oversight would have prevented this problem from occurring. Government regulation of auto design always results in significant cost increases to the consumer with negligible improvements in safety."" These 2 claims need much more support than just a simple assertion. I will even go so far as to state that claim #1 is pure speculation at best as you have no possible way of knowing what would or would not have resulted from additional oversight. While it is certainly true that adding an extra ref to the field does not guarantee there will be fewer penalties, it does offer a very real possibility that fewer players will attempt to game the system knowing they have more eyes upon them. Why do we seem to understand this intuitively with sports but suddenly lose site of this when it comes to business? You are also using works like ""significant"" and ""negligible"" in a very wishy washy way. We really need hard numbers here to accurately assess what is going on. For example, that you might consider a $500 additional cost to be ""significant"" and a ~5% reduction in fatal accidents to be ""negligible"" would be a matter of your personal opinion. Someone else could look at those numbers and disagree with your classification of ""significant"" and ""negligible"". In fact, it is possible someone could look at those hypothetical numbers and conclude the exact opposite (i.e., that the increased cost is negligible and the increased safety is significant). Can we please take this discussion out of the real of wishy washy subjective impression and discuss actual studies with regard to cost and safety? What for example is the cost of an airbag system on a new car bought in 2015 and what are the quantifiable safety implications of that system? Descriptive words like ""significant"" and ""negligible"" do not help without the added context of what those numbers actually are. 3 - ""The 'faulty ignition switch' actually demonstrates the complete inability of government regulation to improve safety or eliminate problems, so it's hard to see how even more regulation will somehow improve things."" This is a poorly formed argument. I will explain why using an analogy of the size of a fire department. Imagine you have a city with a very small fire department and there is a significant problem with fire response times and the extent of property damage. It would be fallacious to suggest that the failure of the current fire department to quickly extinguish fires constitutes proof that fire departments do not work and therefore it is difficult to see how providing funds for additional firefighters, firetrucks, hydrant infrastructure, etc... could possibly improve things. That something appears ineffective at a particular level of investment could just as easily be attributed to a lack of sufficient investment as it could be to the ineffectiveness of the endeavor. One way to test if something is effective or not is to actually see what the marginal improvement rate happens to be. We know for a fact that workplace deaths and injuries have historically fallen in correlation with additional regulation and oversight. This is a fact so well supported it isn't in dispute and is also the reason why products from countries that do not regulate or oversee production has increased rates of workplace death and injury even today. That these items are so strongly correlated in both time and space suggests that there is a greater likelihood that they are causally linked as opposed to it being a mere coincidence. Businesses have proven time and time again that they will meet safety standards as dictated by the law and will rarely if even choose to go above and beyond those requirements. Therefore it is quite easy to see how additional oversight might improve things. Is it a guarantee... not by a long shot... just like having a criminal justice system doesn't completely eliminate crime. The fact that crime still exists is not evidence however that government has a complete inability to reduce criminal activity. Posted by: Artemis at September 24, 2015 4:34 AM A bit of enlightenment: """"Don't you insist that you can tell when a food product is produced correctly,"" No, and I don't particularly like when people tell me what I did say -- when it's not what I said. you should be able to buy anything you want without inspection Yes, I should."" Get some logic, and notice that when you state that you should be able to buy anything you want without inspection, you assume 100% of the duty to determine if a thing is safe. You advertise that you can, in fact, control what you eat all by your lonesome. In short, that sentence says a lot more than you thought it did. And to repeat myself: it is the requirement for a process, NOT the inspection of a final product, which provides the ONLY method capable of delivering a safe product, be it food or automobile: prevention. Posted by: Radwaste at September 24, 2015 5:37 AM """"Don't you insist that you can tell when a food product is produced correctly"" Again -- I did not say this and resent that you say that it is what I say. My position: If I wish to buy cheese that is unregulated by the government, it is none of the government's business. I would never say I can ""tell"" when a food product is produced correctly. That's dishonest debating on your part, perhaps out of a desire to ""win"" the debate. I am willing to assume the ""risk"" that, for example, my friends up mid-state with a goat farm are poisoning me with their unregulated cheese, and...oh yeah, that when I dinner at their house, that I will not die of food poisoning because a government regulator hasn't been around to look at their dinner. P.S. Those salmonella-tainted jars of peanut butter were regulated. Posted by: Amy Alkon at September 24, 2015 6:01 AM What regulation often gives people is a false sense of security. Posted by: Amy Alkon at September 24, 2015 6:03 AM Artemis - I do not mind at all. Your points are well-taken. 1 - You wrote 'If you were to own a private business that was found responsible for injuring a customer then you would suffer personal financial losses as a result of your business being forced to pay fines\/compensation by the court. Why should this be any different for the owners of a public company?' and you are right. But you overlook the fact that GM is paying twice - once in actual compensation to those injured, and then this additional $900 million in 'fines' to the government, supposedly to teach them not to do it again. 2 - I agree, a lot of this discussion revolves around opinion. But one thing is for sure - despite massive existing government regulation, and the imposition of additional costs to consumers for very-specific functions like ABS, air bags, traction control, etc, etc, etc, the rate of deaths and injuries per million miles travelled in the US is not declining at anything-like the rate one would suppose based on the rosy promises of the regulators. For example, in the last 4 years, since ABS and airbags have become universal, it has been essentially flat. Where are the huge savings in lives and injuries we were promised? You asked for math. I approve of this question. For example, there is some statistical analysis which actually shows that airbags, overall, do more harm than good http:\/\/www.amstat.org\/about\/pdfs\/whowantsairbags.pdf and this analysis doesn't even consider the cost of airbags and what that money could have been spent on otherwise. This analysis shows that seatbelts are far-more effective in reducing death and injury. And seatbelts cost far less than airbags do. But seatbelt use involves human agency. 3 - Your analogies with fire departments and crime are not really very applicable, because they ignore multiple issues of moral hazard and human agency. For example, having more firemen and more fire equipment will not cause more fires to occur, or shift hazard from fire, to flood. But adding 'safety' equipment to automobiles by regulation does shift hazard - people drive differently when their vehicles are equipped with functions like ABS, FWD, traction control and airbags, which they have been assured make them 'safer'. Multiple studies have shown, for example, that ABS makes people drive faster, follow closer and brake later. This phenomenon, known as 'risk compensation', applies equally to all sorts of 'safety' devices and regulations. It's why, so often, these 'safety' improvements fail to provide the benefits promised. 4 - when you wrote 'We know for a fact that workplace deaths and injuries have historically fallen in correlation with additional regulation and oversight. This is a fact so well supported it isn't in dispute and is also the reason why products from countries that do not regulate or oversee production has increased rates of workplace death and injury even today.' The correlation is there - what you can't assess is the causation. After all, reductions in workplace deaths and injuries may just as well have been caused by the development of unions and the workplace improvements which they obtained by collective bargaining, or by the rise in tort litigation based on expanded principles of liability and causation. To assign all improvement to 'additional regulation and oversight' is simply unjustified. I stand by what I said - more government regulation would not have caught or prevented the 'faulty ignition switch' problem, because it's an issue of human agency as well as of design intent. If teenage girls weren't in the habit of hanging 18# of cr*p on their keyrings, this 'problem' would never have risen above the noise threshold. Remember the Audi 5000 and 'unintended acceleration' - the horrible bogeyman lurking in the cruise-control system, that just cried out for government regulation? What was the real problem? Pedal misapplication - IOW, they were pressing the gas when they thought they were pressing the brake. How did Audi fix it? A pedal interlock, so you couldn't shift gears unless you were pressing on the brake pedal. Killed the problem stone-dead- so effectively, that the government subsequently mandated the pedal interlock on cars equipped with automatic transmission. Turns out, it had been going on for years, on all sorts of different cars - it's just that government regulators couldn't figure it out. Fascinating. Discuss more. llater, llamas Posted by: llamas at September 24, 2015 6:10 AM Let me put another perspective on the issue. Part of the problem is: there is not a safety culture inside the automobile industry, like there is in the aviation industry. I'm sorry, I've seen the inside of it, and there's just not. There are groups of engineers, the SAE and so forth, but their opinions carry little sway with either management or (in the case of American producers) the UAW. Why is that? It's got a lot to do with the way the two industries are regulated. In the aviation industry, the FAA knows full well that the industry is much bigger than it is, and that it can't possibly possess as much expertise on every subject as the industry as a whole does. What to do? Enlist industry in the cause. The FAA does a lot of things that puts more or less direct control of safety issues in the hands of industry people. It holds them repsonsible, while at the same time giving them leeway for how things are implemented. You don't have that in the automobile industry. There, it is very much top down. NHTSA thinks of itself as being the world's leading experts on everything. They tell the automakers what to build and how to build it. The companies, for their part, get comfortable with the idea that safety is not something they have to put a lot of thought into because NHTSA will tell them what to do. Innovation is discouraged. Ther'e no scientific process and a lot of things are determined by politics -- the government wants to be see as ""doing something"", so it does something, whether effective or not. And yes, that adds a lot of cost and waste to automobile production. Consider the 5-MPH bumper debacle. The insurance industry held it out as something that would reduce repair costs, at a point in the 1970s when a lot of people were up in arms about the costs of body repairs. Did it work? No. Repair costs went up, because the bumper designs as specified by NTHSA didn't work particularly well, and repairing the mechanisms after a collision was an added expense. Yet NHTSA and the insurance industry were able to pat themselves on the back and have Washington fawn over them because they ""did something"". 5-MPH bumpers are still required on cars today and they probably add about $800 to the cost of a car. The Toyota thing is enlightening. The charges against Toyota were complete bullshit; the event was a mass panic (the exact same thing had happened to Audi in the 1980s); the most dramatic tales of unintended acceleration were found to be untrue, and a series of tests done by NASA failed to find any way in which the car's design contributed to the problem. Yet Toyota had to pay protection money. It was government piracy. It had nothing to do with safety. Posted by: Cousin Dave at September 24, 2015 7:53 AM Screw the victims, there's a corporation to protect here! Posted by: Gog_Magog_Carpet_Reclaimers at September 24, 2015 8:35 AM ""I'm guessing the execs on this didn't put their family members in those cars."" BTW, I recall that, in the independent report of the goings on at GM surrounding this issue, the so-called Jenner report, it's made clear that the engineering executive directly in charge of the ignition-switch issue, Ray DiGorgio, bought his college-age son a 2007 Cobalt to drive - so apparently, this issue wasn't quite so clear-cut back then. We do have to remember that we are looking at this in hindsight. However, what Cousin Dave notes is quite correct - safety culture in the auto industry has been poisoned by massive over-interference by government regulators, same as the emissions and fuel-economy area. We're all paying for their insistence that they know best, chasing ever-decreasing benefits at ever-higher cost. No wonder the manufacturers end up cheating to try and build cars people will still want to buy. Most of the big gains still to be had in auto safety are in the areas of driver behaviors - but the government doesn't want to alienate the voters by regulating those, so they just keep demanding more and more technology to try and address the basic idiocy of the average driver. Like airbags, which have very little advantage over a properly-designed-and-used seat belt system. NASCAR cars don't have airbags. I'm not suggesting that every car should have 5-point Simpsons installed, but maybe if we could get the 25% of drivers aged 16-24 who don't wear the standard seat belt to just buckle up, we might see some serious reductions in death and injuries, and the marginal cost would  0. The other major area for improvement is roadway design, and here you have a typical bureaucratic turf war between NHTSA (vehicles and people) and DoT (roads and things), plus many roads are designed and constructed by the states. This is one area where government standardization might be a big benefit, and there's lots to learn from European countries where the thinking is more-advanced in these areas. llater, llamas Posted by: llamas at September 24, 2015 9:57 AM Leave a comment
